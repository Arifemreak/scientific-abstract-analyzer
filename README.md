# 🧠 Scientific Abstract Analyzer – Makale Özeti App

This interactive web application takes a biomedical scientific abstract as input and uses machine learning techniques to identify the most relevant biomedical domain — such as **CRISPR**, **AI in Oncology**, or **Epigenetics**.  
It also retrieves the most semantically similar abstracts from a curated dataset to support literature discovery.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Sentence-transformer embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- ✅ XGBoost-based domain classification
- ✅ Multi-label classification with threshold
- ✅ Cosine similarity for top-k abstract matches
- ✅ Visual confidence score (progress bar)
- ✅ Real-time feedback logging
