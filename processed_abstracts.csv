"Celastrol has been shown to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (<i>FANCD2</i>), a ferroptosis inhibitor, promotes HCC proliferation and invasion. This study aims to investigate whether Celastrol exerts its effects by targeting <i>FANCD2</i>. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified differentially expressed genes in HCC utilizing Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2). <i>FANCD2</i> and Celastrol were analyzed for molecular docking using Autodock, which was based on geometric matching and energy matching. The correlation between <i>FANCD2</i> and survival rate was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier's estimates by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. HCC cell lines (SNU-423 and SNU-387) were overexpressed or silenced with <i>FANCD2</i> and treated with Celastrol. Autophagy and ferroptosis were evaluated by measuring oxidative stress and related markers, and cell function experiments were performed. High expression of <i>FANCD2</i> was correlated with poor survival in HCC patients. Celastrol targeted <i>FANCD2</i>, reducing its level in SNU-423 and SNU-387 cells. <i>FANCD2</i> overexpression resulted in increased SNU-423 cell viability, migration, invasion, and tube formation ability, as well as attenuated autophagy and ferroptosis, while <i>FANCD2</i> knockdown in SNU-387 cells showed opposite effects. Additionally, <i>FANCD2</i> overexpression reversed the ability of Celastrol to induce autophagy and ferroptosis and to inhibit SNU-423 cell survival <i>in vitro</i>, while <i>FANCD2</i> knockdown enhanced the effects of Celastrol in SNU-387 cells.

"There is limited data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older breast cancer (BC) patients. This study examines patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by type of endocrine therapy (ET) prescribed, aromatase inhibitors (AI), or tamoxifen (Tam) to estrogen receptor-positive BC patients aged ≥70 years. This retrospective review includes 1052 women diagnosed with early-stage BC from the REQUITE study database, who underwent breast conservation surgery (BCS), and received adjuvant breast radiation therapy (RT), and ET as the only systemic therapy. Among them, 201 women were aged ≥70 years. The PROs were assessed by using EORTC-QLQ-C30, BR23, and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory measures obtained at baseline after BCS, post-RT, and at 1, 2, and 3 years follow-up. Statistical analysis involves mixed model analysis of variance and propensity score weights. Among the 201 women, 131 received AI, and 70 received Tam. The overall mean age of this cohort is 75.3 years. Compared with Tam, AI-treated patients experience worse insomnia and general and physical fatigue. Tam-treated patients experienced more physical and cognitive functioning decline than the AI-treated patients. The Tam-treated patients also reported more mental fatigue and reduced sexual enjoyment compared to the AI-treated patients. This study suggests a differential impact by type of ET on distinct HRQoL domains experienced by older postmenopausal women. Furthermore, larger prospective clinical trials are necessary to inform treatment decisions for older ER-positive BC patients, considering patient preferences and understanding trade-offs between disease outcomes and HRQoL.",AI in Oncology,limited data healthrelated quality life hrqol older breast cancer bc patients study examines patientreported outcomes pros type endocrine therapy et prescribed aromatase inhibitors ai tamoxifen tam estrogen receptorpositive bc patients aged years retrospective review includes women diagnosed earlystage bc requite study database underwent breast conservation surgery bcs received adjuvant breast radiation therapy rt et systemic therapy among women aged years pros assessed using eortcqlqc br multidimensional fatigue inventory measures obtained baseline bcs postrt years followup statistical analysis involves mixed model analysis variance propensity score weights among women received ai received tam overall mean age cohort years compared tam aitreated patients experience worse insomnia general physical fatigue tamtreated patients experienced physical cognitive functioning decline aitreated patients tamtreated patients also reported mental fatigue reduced sexual enjoyment compared aitreated patients study suggests differential impact type et distinct hrqol domains experienced older postmenopausal women furthermore larger prospective clinical trials necessary inform treatment decisions older erpositive bc patients considering patient preferences understanding tradeoffs disease outcomes hrqol,AI in Oncology
"The acquired resistance to existing therapies poses a grave concern in achieving successful therapeutic outcomes. Temozolomide (TMZ), a widely used alkylating chemotherapeutic in Glioblastoma therapy, often encounters resistance, necessitating the investigation of the underlying mechanisms of TMZ-acquired resistance. To study TMZ resistance, a cell-based model system was generated by intermittently exposing glioblastoma cells to increasing concentrations and time of TMZ over six months. The survival response of cells at higher concentrations confirmed TMZ-resistant cells, which exhibited a phenotypic shift toward a mesenchymal-like state, with decreased epithelial traits, indicating mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). This transition likely facilitates the stabilization and clonal growth of TMZ-resistant cells. Subsequent analysis revealed elevated expression of TLK1, a DNA repair protein, thus reinforcing its potential involvement in mechanisms associated with acquired resistance. To explore the therapeutic aspect of TLK1 inhibition, we utilized an in-house developed TLK1 inhibitor, J54. The inhibition of TLK1 in TMZ-resistant cells enhanced cytotoxicity, indicating TLK1 as a potential target to combat TMZ resistance. Moreover, TLK1 inhibition reduced cell migration and invasion, implying its role in promoting metastasis. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the role of TLK1 in the context of TMZ resistance, highlighting its potential as a valuable target for therapeutic intervention.",AI in Oncology,acquired resistance existing therapies poses grave concern achieving successful therapeutic outcomes temozolomide tmz widely used alkylating chemotherapeutic glioblastoma therapy often encounters resistance necessitating investigation underlying mechanisms tmzacquired resistance study tmz resistance cellbased model system generated intermittently exposing glioblastoma cells increasing concentrations time tmz six months survival response cells higher concentrations confirmed tmzresistant cells exhibited phenotypic shift toward mesenchymallike state decreased epithelial traits indicating mesenchymalepithelial transition met transition likely facilitates stabilization clonal growth tmzresistant cells subsequent analysis revealed elevated expression tlk dna repair protein thus reinforcing potential involvement mechanisms associated acquired resistance explore therapeutic aspect tlk inhibition utilized inhouse developed tlk inhibitor j inhibition tlk tmzresistant cells enhanced cytotoxicity indicating tlk potential target combat tmz resistance moreover tlk inhibition reduced cell migration invasion implying role promoting metastasis conclusion study sheds light role tlk context tmz resistance highlighting potential valuable target therapeutic intervention,AI in Oncology
"Liquid biopsies are an increasingly important tool for the real-time monitoring of biomarkers, cancer recurrence, and disease burden in oncology practice. Tempus xF+ is a liquid biopsy assay that detects cell-free DNA in blood samples of patients with advanced solid tumors. The xF+ panel covers 523 genes spanning approximately 1.8 Mb of the human genome and can detect single-nucleotide variants and insertions-deletions in 522 genes. It also detects copy number gains in 7 genes and translocations (gene rearrangements) in 10 genes. Furthermore, the larger panel size allows for the calculation of blood tumor mutational burden. This work highlights the analytical validation performed for the xF+ assay, comparing it with a smaller panel liquid biopsy assay, calculating blood tumor mutational burden, and exploring its potential clinical utility.",AI in Oncology,liquid biopsies increasingly important tool realtime monitoring biomarkers cancer recurrence disease burden oncology practice tempus xf liquid biopsy assay detects cellfree dna blood samples patients advanced solid tumors xf panel covers genes spanning approximately mb human genome detect singlenucleotide variants insertionsdeletions genes also detects copy number gains genes translocations gene rearrangements genes furthermore larger panel size allows calculation blood tumor mutational burden work highlights analytical validation performed xf assay comparing smaller panel liquid biopsy assay calculating blood tumor mutational burden exploring potential clinical utility,AI in Oncology
"Eradication of inhibitors is still a desirable goal for hemophilia A inhibitor patients. Combining rituximab with immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the second-line regimen, but data and predictors are limited. 76 children with high-titer inhibitor prospectively using low-dose ITI together with 1-3 round(s) of rituximab were evaluated for outcomes: i.e. success or failure and rapidity (rapid or slow) of inhibitor negativity (i.e. inhibitor titers turned negative, IN). The whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze the gene expression profile of 4 failure patients (excluding F8 large deletion) and 4 rapid success-IN patients. Success-IN was achieved in 41/76 (53.9%) patients after 1<sup>st</sup> round rituximab, 50/76 (65.8%) after 2<sup>nd</sup> round rituximab, and 51/76 (67.1%) after 3<sup>rd</sup> round rituximab. Profile of inhibitor decay follows an exponential decay curve. Time to a given inhibitor titer during ITI-Rituximab could be estimated by the model t=ln(Y0-PlateauY-Plateau)k. time to insufficient inhibitor-titer decay or relapse. This model is proposed for prognostic prediction of ITI-rituximab. RNA-seq analysis showed 186 up-regulated differential expressed genes (DEGs) and 176 down-regulated DEGs in failure subjects compared to rapid success-IN. The up-regulated DEGs included CXCL8, NLRP6, CHI3L1, CLEC9A, THBD, PROS1. The down-regulated DEGs included STAT1, TLR7, C1Q, C2, IDO1, CD38. Success-IN was achieved in 67% of hemophilia A children with high-titer inhibitor treated by ITI- rituximab. A model based on the profile of inhibitor-titer decay can be used for predicting outcomes. Humoral immune response, complement and coagulation cascades may act at signals that influence ITI outcomes.

"Obesity is associated with a greater risk of developing distant recurrences in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. This association is however poorly investigated in patients treated with extended endocrine treatment (ET). We therefore evaluated the prognostic role of BMI in the SOLE trial, where postmenopausal patients, after having completed 4-6 years of adjuvant ET, were treated with 5 additional years of continuous or intermittent letrozole. We considered the 3606 patients with ER+ /HER2- lymph node-positive BC with available BMI from the SOLE trial (NCT00553410). Distant-recurrence free interval (DRFI) was the main endpoint, and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) secondary endpoints. Adjusted risk ratios (RR) for distant metastases were estimated with crude cumulative incidence models. 38.6 % of the patients were underweight or normal weight, 36.5 % overweight and 24.9 % obese. BMI was associated with age, tumor size, number of positive lymph nodes, menopausal status and type of prior ET. In the adjusted analyses, the prognostic value of BMI was dependent on prior ET and extended ET arm (second-order interaction p-value<0.001 for DRFI, BCFI and DFS, but not for OS). For instance, in patients treated with both a selective estrogen receptor modulator and an aromatase inhibitor in the first five years, obesity, as compared to normal-weight, was associated with better (RR<sub>DRFI</sub>=0.61, 95 %CI: 0.42-0.90) and worse (RR<sub>DRFI</sub>=2.31, 95 %CI: 1.41-3.78) outcomes in the adjusted models, in patients treated with continuous and intermittent letrozole in the extended ET, respectively. We observed that the prognostic relation of BMI changes according to the type of adjuvant ET and mode of administration of extended AI. This warrants further investigation.",AI in Oncology,obesity associated greater risk developing distant recurrences patients estrogen receptorpositive er breast cancer association however poorly investigated patients treated extended endocrine treatment et therefore evaluated prognostic role bmi sole trial postmenopausal patients completed years adjuvant et treated additional years continuous intermittent letrozole considered patients er lymph nodepositive bc available bmi sole trial nct distantrecurrence free interval drfi main endpoint breast cancerfree interval bcfi diseasefree survival dfs overall survival os secondary endpoints adjusted risk ratios rr distant metastases estimated crude cumulative incidence models patients underweight normal weight overweight obese bmi associated age tumor size number positive lymph nodes menopausal status type prior et adjusted analyses prognostic value bmi dependent prior et extended et arm secondorder interaction pvalue drfi bcfi dfs os instance patients treated selective estrogen receptor modulator aromatase inhibitor first five years obesity compared normalweight associated better rrsubdrfisub ci worse rrsubdrfisub ci outcomes adjusted models patients treated continuous intermittent letrozole extended et respectively observed prognostic relation bmi changes according type adjuvant et mode administration extended ai warrants investigation,AI in Oncology
"Gliomas account for 24.5% of all primary brain tumors and 80% of all malignant tumors in adults. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) play an important role in disrupting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and invasion. This study evaluates the outcomes of VEGFR TKIs in patients with glioma, with a specific analysis on glioblastoma (GBM). Electronic databases of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were conducted until 23 July 2024. Studies that evaluated the survival of patients with glioma treated with VEGFR TKI were included. All statistical analyses were conducted using the R program. A total of 24 studies, including 1,146 glioma patients with a median age range of 5.8 to 62 years were recruited. Regarding progression-free survival (PFS), the six-month PFS rate was reported with a pooled value of 21% [95% CI: 15% to 28%]. The 12-month PFS rate was evaluated in three studies, ranging from 5 to 38% with a pooled rate of 15% [95% CI: 8% to 27%]. Considering the radiological response, the pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 21% [95% CI: 15%-28%]. Evaluation of the subgroups based on drug type at the six-month follow-up showed no significant difference in overall survival (OS) rates among patients (p = 0.06). Our results revealed that VEGFR TKIs in patients with glioma, were associated with limited efficacy. The long-term effectiveness of these treatments remains controversial and requires longer follow-up, which is challenging in cancer cases.",AI in Oncology,gliomas account primary brain tumors malignant tumors adults vascular endothelial growth factor receptors vegfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis play important role disrupting angiogenesis tumor growth invasion study evaluates outcomes vegfr tkis patients glioma specific analysis glioblastoma gbm electronic databases pubmedmedline embase scopus web science conducted july studies evaluated survival patients glioma treated vegfr tki included statistical analyses conducted using r program total studies including glioma patients median age range years recruited regarding progressionfree survival pfs sixmonth pfs rate reported pooled value ci month pfs rate evaluated three studies ranging pooled rate ci considering radiological response pooled overall response rate orr ci evaluation subgroups based drug type sixmonth followup showed significant difference overall survival os rates among patients p results revealed vegfr tkis patients glioma associated limited efficacy longterm effectiveness treatments remains controversial requires longer followup challenging cancer cases,AI in Oncology
"The effect of metformin on postoperative delirium (POD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing cardiovascular surgery remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether metformin use reduces POD risk in this high-risk population by analyzing data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database using propensity score matching (PSM). We included T2DM patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve replacement between 2015 and 2018. PSM was used to balance covariates between metformin users and non-users. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to assess POD risk and its cumulative incidence. Metformin use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of POD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.67). A dose-response trend was observed, with decreasing aORs for higher cumulative metformin exposure. Protective factors included higher income, urban residency, and statin use; risk factors included older age, prolonged anesthesia, higher aDCSI, CCI scores, and depression. Metformin significantly lowers the risk of POD in T2DM patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, showing a clear dose-dependent protective effect. These findings highlight metformin's potential as a chemopreventive agent against post-surgical complications in this population.",AI in Oncology,effect metformin postoperative delirium pod patients type diabetes mellitus tdm undergoing cardiovascular surgery remains unclear study aimed evaluate whether metformin use reduces pod risk highrisk population analyzing data taiwans national health insurance research database using propensity score matching psm included tdm patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting cabg valve replacement psm used balance covariates metformin users nonusers logistic regression kaplanmeier analyses performed assess pod risk cumulative incidence metformin use associated significantly reduced risk pod adjusted odds ratio aor confidence interval ci doseresponse trend observed decreasing aors higher cumulative metformin exposure protective factors included higher income urban residency statin use risk factors included older age prolonged anesthesia higher adcsi cci scores depression metformin significantly lowers risk pod tdm patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery showing clear dosedependent protective effect findings highlight metformins potential chemopreventive agent postsurgical complications population,AI in Oncology
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly advanced cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in tumors with low tumor mutational burden (TMB) remains suboptimal. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the impact of somatic mutations on overall survival (OS) in TMB-low patients treated with ICIs and to explore the potential for personalized treatment selection through machine learning. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 1172 TMB-low (TMB < 10 mutations per megabase) patients with cancer receiving ICIs, examining the association between specific gene mutations and OS. Additionally, we developed a decision tree model (DTM) to predict OS based on clinical features and tumor mutational profiles. Our findings reveal that mutations in DAXX, HLA-A, H3C2, IGF1R, CTNNB1, SMARCA4, KMT2D, and TP53 are significantly associated with poorer survival outcomes in the multivariate analysis. Remarkably, for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, VHL mutations predicted improved OS following ICI even when adjusted for age, sex, and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in both multivariate analysis and the DTM model. These results reinforce the prevailing notion that TMB alone does not predict ICI response, highlighting the critical role of individual gene mutations in TMB-low tumors under ICI therapy. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the promise of machine learning models in optimizing ICI treatment decisions, paving the way for more precise and effective therapeutic strategies in this patient population.",AI in Oncology,immune checkpoint inhibitors icis significantly advanced cancer therapy yet efficacy tumors low tumor mutational burden tmb remains suboptimal study aimed elucidate impact somatic mutations overall survival os tmblow patients treated icis explore potential personalized treatment selection machine learning conducted comprehensive analysis tmblow tmb mutations per megabase patients cancer receiving icis examining association specific gene mutations os additionally developed decision tree model dtm predict os based clinical features tumor mutational profiles findings reveal mutations daxx hlaa hc igfr ctnnb smarca kmtd tp significantly associated poorer survival outcomes multivariate analysis remarkably renal cell carcinoma rcc patients vhl mutations predicted improved os following ici even adjusted age sex microsatellite instability msi status multivariate analysis dtm model results reinforce prevailing notion tmb alone predict ici response highlighting critical role individual gene mutations tmblow tumors ici therapy furthermore study demonstrates promise machine learning models optimizing ici treatment decisions paving way precise effective therapeutic strategies patient population,AI in Oncology
"Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a derivative of artemisinin, which affects inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune regulation. However, the mechanism underlying its effects remains largely unknown. This study aims to explore the mechanism by which DHA affects radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), providing new insights for lung radiotherapy. To elucidate its mechanism of action, C57BL/6 J mice were irradiated with 15 Gy whole chest. RILI was evaluated by qRT-PCR, ELISA, histology, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and RILI signaling cascade studies. In addition, small interfering RNAs were employed to knockdown cGAS proteins in the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the human bronchial epithelium cell line (BEAS-2B). Both In Vivo and Vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the specific mechanism by which DHA alleviated RILI. We observed the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, along with the phosphorylation of the downstream target NF-κB and an increase in inflammatory factor levels in the mouse model following radiation exposure. In the cell model, irradiation also triggered the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and its downstream targets, leading to elevated levels of inflammatory factors. Notably, knocking down the cGAS using small interfering RNA in the BEAS-2B cells significantly alleviated RILI in the cell model. Our study elucidated the mechanism of DHA reducing RILI through the cGAS/STING/NF-κB signaling pathway, and revealed that the GAS/STING/NF-κB axis may be a potential therapeutic target for RILI.",AI in Oncology,dihydroartemisinin dha derivative artemisinin affects inflammation oxidative stress immune regulation however mechanism underlying effects remains largely unknown study aims explore mechanism dha affects radiationinduced lung injury rili providing new insights lung radiotherapy elucidate mechanism action cbl j mice irradiated gy whole chest rili evaluated qrtpcr elisa histology western blot analysis immunohistochemistry rili signaling cascade studies addition small interfering rnas employed knockdown cgas proteins cgassting signaling pathway human bronchial epithelium cell line beasb vivo vitro experiments conducted investigate specific mechanism dha alleviated rili observed activation cgassting pathway along phosphorylation downstream target nfb increase inflammatory factor levels mouse model following radiation exposure cell model irradiation also triggered activation cgassting signaling pathway downstream targets leading elevated levels inflammatory factors notably knocking cgas using small interfering rna beasb cells significantly alleviated rili cell model study elucidated mechanism dha reducing rili cgasstingnfb signaling pathway revealed gasstingnfb axis may potential therapeutic target rili,AI in Oncology
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a novel role in aiding healthcare system functions and enhancing the patient experience. Multidisciplinary teams (MDT) have become an integral part of disease and management planning, especially with the rising number of our aging population and the paucity of sufficient resources. The incorporation of MDTs facilitates a holistic approach to patient care, encompassing the physical, psychological, and social needs of patients and their families. Particularly with the growing number of colorectal cancer diagnoses, notably among the younger populations, the utilization of AI in the colorectal MDT holds great potential value. The ability to enhance the quality of these interdisciplinary discussions will likely reflect on improving holistic patient-centered care and reducing the numbers of late or misdiagnosis.

"Persistent infection with HPV causes nearly 5% of all cancers worldwide, including cervical and oropharyngeal cancers. Compared to HPV-negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), HPV-positive (HPV+) HNSCCs exhibit a significantly improved treatment response; however, established treatment regimens were largely developed for HPV- disease. Effectively de-escalating therapy and optimizing treatment protocols to minimize toxicity for both HPV+ and HPV- tumors has been variably successful, in part due to the heterogeneity of cellular subpopulations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has primarily been used to define immune cell populations rather than the cell type of origin, epithelial cells. To address this, we analyzed published scRNAseq data of HPV+ and HPV- HNSCCs to distinguish epithelial tumor cell populations as a function of HPV status. We identified the transcriptome signatures, ontologies, and candidate biomarkers of newly identified epithelial subpopulations with attention to those that are shared or enriched in HPV+ or HPV- HNSCCs. We hypothesize that distinct epithelial cell populations and reprogramming in HPV- versus HPV+ HNSCC represent important components of the pro-tumor environment. These are described here as a foundation for the identification of new epithelial-cell-specific biomarkers, effectors, and candidate targets for optimizing the treatment of HNSCC.",AI in Oncology,persistent infection hpv causes nearly cancers worldwide including cervical oropharyngeal cancers compared hpvnegative hpv head neck squamous cell carcinomas hnsccs hpvpositive hpv hnsccs exhibit significantly improved treatment response however established treatment regimens largely developed hpv disease effectively deescalating therapy optimizing treatment protocols minimize toxicity hpv hpv tumors variably successful part due heterogeneity cellular subpopulations singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq primarily used define immune cell populations rather cell type origin epithelial cells address analyzed published scrnaseq data hpv hpv hnsccs distinguish epithelial tumor cell populations function hpv status identified transcriptome signatures ontologies candidate biomarkers newly identified epithelial subpopulations attention shared enriched hpv hpv hnsccs hypothesize distinct epithelial cell populations reprogramming hpv versus hpv hnscc represent important components protumor environment described foundation identification new epithelialcellspecific biomarkers effectors candidate targets optimizing treatment hnscc,AI in Oncology
"Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the digestive tract, driven by an imbalance in immune system regulation, where proinflammatory interleukin-23 (IL-23) plays an essential role. Selective new IL-23 inhibitors, including risankizumab, guselkumab, and mirikizumab, block the IL-23p19 subunit to inhibit the Il-23 action and alleviate inflammation in CD. This review explores the effectiveness, safety, and therapeutic potential of anti-IL-23 treatment in CD management. Risankizumab, guselkumab, and mirikizumab demonstrated considerable effectiveness in inducing clinical remission and promoting endoscopic healing in patients with moderately to severely active CD, including those refractory to anti-TNF therapies. Risankizumab showed favorable results in pivotal trials like ADVANCE, MOTIVATE, and FORTIFY, achieving remission rates of up to 45% and sustained inflammatory biomarkers normalization. Guselkumab and mirikizumab similarly demonstrated substantial efficacy in the induction and maintenance phases, with promising long-term results. The safety profiles of IL-23 inhibitors were favorable, with low rates of serious adverse events, including infections and malignancies. Selective new IL-23 inhibitors represent a targeted and effective therapeutic class for moderately to severely active CD, offering high clinical and endoscopic remission rates, and favorable safety outcomes.

"<b>Background:</b> Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming thoracic surgery by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, surgical precision, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative management. AI-driven technologies, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, computer vision, and robotic-assisted surgery, have the potential to optimize clinical workflows and improve patient outcomes. However, challenges such as data integration, ethical concerns, and regulatory barriers must be addressed to ensure AI's safe and effective implementation. This review aims to analyze the current applications, benefits, limitations, and future directions of AI in thoracic surgery. <b>Methods:</b> This review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for studies published up to January 2025. Relevant articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on AI applications in thoracic surgery, including diagnostics, robotic-assisted surgery, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative care. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. <b>Results:</b> Out of 279 identified studies, 36 met the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, highlighting AI's growing role in diagnostic accuracy, surgical precision, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative care in thoracic surgery. AI-driven imaging analysis and radiomics have improved pulmonary nodule detection, lung cancer classification, and lymph node metastasis prediction, while robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) has enhanced surgical accuracy, reduced operative times, and improved recovery rates. Intraoperatively, AI-powered image-guided navigation, augmented reality (AR), and real-time decision-support systems have optimized surgical planning and safety. Postoperatively, AI-driven predictive models and wearable monitoring devices have enabled early complication detection and improved patient follow-up. However, challenges remain, including algorithmic biases, a lack of multicenter validation, high implementation costs, and ethical concerns regarding data security and clinical accountability. Despite these limitations, AI has shown significant potential to enhance surgical outcomes, requiring further research and standardized validation for widespread adoption. <b>Conclusions:</b> AI is poised to revolutionize thoracic surgery by enhancing decision-making, improving patient outcomes, and optimizing surgical workflows. However, widespread adoption requires addressing key limitations through multicenter validation studies, standardized AI frameworks, and ethical AI governance. Future research should focus on digital twin technology, federated learning, and explainable AI (XAI) to improve AI interpretability, reliability, and accessibility.

"<i>Aim</i>: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women, accounting for more than 30% of new female cancers each year. Although various treatments are available for BC, most cancer-related deaths are due to incurable metastases. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of BC are crucial before metastasis. Mammography and ultrasonography are primarily used in the clinic for the initial identification and staging of BC; these methods are useful for general screening but have limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Omics-based biomarkers, like metabolomics, can make early diagnosis much more accurate, make tracking the disease's progression more accurate, and help make personalized treatment plans that are tailored to each tumor's specific molecular profile. Metabolomics technology is a feasible and comprehensive method for early disease detection and biomarker identification at the molecular level. This research aimed to establish an interpretable predictive artificial intelligence (AI) model using plasma-based metabolomics panel data to identify potential biomarkers that distinguish BC individuals from healthy controls. <i>Methods</i>: A cohort of 138 BC patients and 76 healthy controls were studied. Plasma metabolites were examined using LC-TOFMS and GC-TOFMS techniques.

"<b>Objectives</b>: This study evaluates the potential of high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) in differentiating between benign and malignant glottic lesions, offering a non-invasive diagnostic tool for clinicians. Moreover, a new parameter derived from high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) had been proposed and implemented in the analysis for an objective assessment of the vocal fold stiffness. <b>Methods</b>: High-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) was conducted on 102 participants, including 21 normophonic individuals, 39 patients with benign vocal fold lesions, and 42 with glottic cancer. Laryngotopographic parameter describing the stiffness of vocal fold (SAI) and kymographic parameters describing amplitude, symmetry, and glottal dynamics were quantified. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and lesion classification was performed using a machine learning model. <b>Results</b>: Univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that SAI (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.839-0.962) and weighted amplitude asymmetry (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85-0.974) were highly effective in distinguishing between normophonic and organic lesions (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Further multivariate analysis using machine learning models demonstrated improved accuracy, with the SVM classifier achieving an AUC of 0.93 for detecting organic lesions and 0.83 for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. <b>Conclusions</b>: The study demonstrates the potential value of parameter describing the pliability of infiltrated vocal fold (SAI) as a non-invasive tool to support histopathological evaluation in laryngeal lesions, with machine learning models enhancing diagnostic performance.",AI in Oncology,bobjectivesb study evaluates potential highspeed videoendoscopy hsv differentiating benign malignant glottic lesions offering noninvasive diagnostic tool clinicians moreover new parameter derived highspeed videoendoscopy hsv proposed implemented analysis objective assessment vocal fold stiffness bmethodsb highspeed videoendoscopy hsv conducted participants including normophonic individuals patients benign vocal fold lesions glottic cancer laryngotopographic parameter describing stiffness vocal fold sai kymographic parameters describing amplitude symmetry glottal dynamics quantified statistical differences groups assessed using receiver operating characteristic roc analysis lesion classification performed using machine learning model bresultsb univariate receiver operating characteristic roc analysis revealed sai auc ci weighted amplitude asymmetry auc ci highly effective distinguishing normophonic organic lesions ipi multivariate analysis using machine learning models demonstrated improved accuracy svm classifier achieving auc detecting organic lesions distinguishing benign malignant lesions bconclusionsb study demonstrates potential value parameter describing pliability infiltrated vocal fold sai noninvasive tool support histopathological evaluation laryngeal lesions machine learning models enhancing diagnostic performance,AI in Oncology
"<b>Background:</b> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and highly lethal form of liver cancer, with limited effective treatment options, particularly in the advanced stages. Immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has emerged as a promising treatment modality, yet a substantial proportion of patients exhibit resistance or fail to respond to such therapies. This study aimed to elucidate the role of G0/G1 Switch 2 (G0S2) in regulating PD-L1 expression in monocytes within the HCC tumor microenvironment and to investigate its impact on the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. <b>Methods:</b> Gene expression data among HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were obtained from the HCC single-cell sequencing database; immunohistochemistry was performed to detect G0S2 expression in liver cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues of HCC patients; flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the expression of G0S2, PD-L1, CD206, and CD14 in PBMCs from HCC patients; and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion were used to evaluate the impact of G0S2 knockdown. <b>Results:</b> Utilizing single-cell sequencing data from HCC patients, we identified that G0S2 expression was significantly elevated in the non-responders (NR) compared to responders (R) to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels of G0S2 in HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues, while the flow cytometry revealed the increased expression of G0S2, PD-L1, and CD206 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from NR patients compared to R patients and healthy controls. The functional experiments involving the knockdown of G0S2 in the THP-1 monocyte cell line resulted in a significant reduction in PD-L1 expression and a concomitant increase in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings indicate that G0S2 facilitates the upregulation of PD-L1 in monocytes, thereby suppressing T cell activity and contributing to resistance against PD-1 inhibitors in HCC. The high expression of G0S2 in peripheral blood monocytes offers a non-invasive and easily detectable biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Consequently, targeting G0S2 may enhance the responsiveness to immunotherapy in HCC patients, providing a new avenue for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",AI in Oncology,bbackgroundb hepatocellular carcinoma hcc prevalent highly lethal form liver cancer limited effective treatment options particularly advanced stages immunotherapy using pd inhibitors emerged promising treatment modality yet substantial proportion patients exhibit resistance fail respond therapies study aimed elucidate role gg switch gs regulating pdl expression monocytes within hcc tumor microenvironment investigate impact efficacy pd inhibitors bmethodsb gene expression data among hcc patients treated pd inhibitors obtained hcc singlecell sequencing database immunohistochemistry performed detect gs expression liver cancer tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues hcc patients flow cytometry utilized analyze expression gs pdl cd cd pbmcs hcc patients cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn secretion used evaluate impact gs knockdown bresultsb utilizing singlecell sequencing data hcc patients identified gs expression significantly elevated nonresponders nr compared responders r pd inhibitor therapy immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels gs hcc tumor tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues flow cytometry revealed increased expression gs pdl cd peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs nr patients compared r patients healthy controls functional experiments involving knockdown gs thp monocyte cell line resulted significant reduction pdl expression concomitant increase cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn production bconclusionsb findings indicate gs facilitates upregulation pdl monocytes thereby suppressing cell activity contributing resistance pd inhibitors hcc high expression gs peripheral blood monocytes offers noninvasive easily detectable biomarker predicting efficacy pd inhibitor therapy consequently targeting gs may enhance responsiveness immunotherapy hcc patients providing new avenue optimizing treatment strategies improving patient outcomes,AI in Oncology
"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical education assessment remains largely unexplored, particularly in specialty-specific evaluations during clinical rotations. Traditional question development methods are time-intensive and often struggle to keep pace with evolving medical knowledge. This study evaluated the effectiveness of AI-generated questions in assessing urological competency among medical interns during a standardized clinical rotation. Two state-of-the-art AI language models (ChatGPT and Gemini) generated 300 multiple-choice questions across six urological subspecialties. Seven experienced urologists, each with over 10 years of clinical practice and active involvement in resident training programs, independently evaluated the questions using a modified Delphi approach with standardized scoring rubrics. The evaluation criteria encompassed technical accuracy based on current clinical guidelines, clinical relevance to core rotation objectives, construct validity assessed through cognitive task analysis, and alignment with rotation objectives. Questions achieving consensus approval from at least five experts were retained, resulting in 100 validated questions. From the initial cohort of 45 eligible interns, 42 completed all three assessment points (93.3% completion rate). Performance improved significantly from baseline (mean: 45.2%, 95% CI: 42.6-47.8%) through mid-rotation (mean: 62.8%, 95% CI: 60.4-65.2%) to final assessment (mean: 78.4%, 95% CI: 76.5-80.3%). The technical accuracy was comparable between AI platforms (ChatGPT: 84.3%, Gemini: 83.8%, p = 0.86). Clinical scenario questions demonstrated better discrimination than recall questions (mean indices: 0.28 vs. 0.14, p < 0.001). Subspecialty performance varied, with highest scores in uro-oncology (mean: 82.6%, 95% CI: 80.2-85.0%) and endourology (mean: 79.4%, 95% CI: 77.0-81.8%). AI-generated questions showed appropriate technical accuracy and difficulty levels for assessing clinical competency in urology. While promising for formative assessment, particularly with clinical scenarios, current limitations in discrimination capability suggest careful consideration for high-stakes testing. The strong correlation between clinical exposure and improved performance validates their effectiveness in measuring knowledge acquisition. These findings support the potential integration of AI-generated questions in specialty-specific assessment, though careful implementation with expert oversight and continuous validation remains essential.

"Clinical trials have shown that neoadjuvant anlotinib combined with PD-1 blockade therapy can prolong the survival of patients with driver gene negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but some patients fail to benefit from the combination therapy. To explore the potential drug resistance mechanism and predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in NSCLC patients, we used scRNA-seq to observe and analyze the dynamic changes of immune cells, stromal cells and cancer cells in NSCLC patients who received neoadjuvant combination therapy. We analyzed transcriptome data of ~ 47,000 single cells from 9 NSCLC patients, including 3 treatment naïve patients, 3 post-treatment patients with major pathological response (MPR), and 3 Non-MPR patients. Subsequently, the infiltration of immune cells was detected by immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence in NSCLC. In MPR patients, we found that neoadjuvant therapy reduced the expression of the T cell exhausted signature, reduced the transition of T_THEMIS cells to Tregs, and enhanced the positive feedback between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and PAX5<sup>+</sup> memory B cells. In Non-MPR patients, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dampen therapeutic efficiency by being the hub of cell communication. TAMs and fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via VEGF, endothelial ZEB1 may up-regulate FLT1 (VEGFR) expression in response to anlotinib, and VEGFR<sup>+</sup> endothelial cell signature can predict survival of NSCLC cohort in TCGA. In addition, PLA2G4A, the key enzyme in the VEGF pathway, was highly expressed in the tumor cells of Non-MPR patients after anlotinib treatment. In 135 NSCLC patients, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that PLA2G4A was positively correlated with poor prognosis and Tregs infiltration. In conclusion, VEGF signaling dependent dynamic changes in endothelial and epithelial cells are deeply involved in the formation of anlotinib resistance and immunosuppression phenotypes in NSCLC patients.",AI in Oncology,clinical trials shown neoadjuvant anlotinib combined pd blockade therapy prolong survival patients driver gene negative nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc patients fail benefit combination therapy explore potential drug resistance mechanism predict efficacy neoadjuvant therapy nsclc patients used scrnaseq observe analyze dynamic changes immune cells stromal cells cancer cells nsclc patients received neoadjuvant combination therapy analyzed transcriptome data single cells nsclc patients including treatment nave patients posttreatment patients major pathological response mpr nonmpr patients subsequently infiltration immune cells detected immunohistochemistry multiplex immunofluorescence nsclc mpr patients found neoadjuvant therapy reduced expression cell exhausted signature reduced transition tthemis cells tregs enhanced positive feedback cdsupsup cells paxsupsup memory b cells nonmpr patients tumorassociated macrophages tams dampen therapeutic efficiency hub cell communication tams fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via vegf endothelial zeb may upregulate flt vegfr expression response anlotinib vegfrsupsup endothelial cell signature predict survival nsclc cohort tcga addition plaga key enzyme vegf pathway highly expressed tumor cells nonmpr patients anlotinib treatment nsclc patients confirmed immunohistochemistry plaga positively correlated poor prognosis tregs infiltration conclusion vegf signaling dependent dynamic changes endothelial epithelial cells deeply involved formation anlotinib resistance immunosuppression phenotypes nsclc patients,AI in Oncology
"This study explored the therapeutic effects of anlotinib in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) models and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Human C643 and CAL-62 anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines were cultured in vitro and treated with anlotinib. The effects of anlotinib on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion of C643 and CAL-62 cells were observed. The tumour volumes and body weights of BALB/c-nu mice bearing subcutaneous tumours were recorded within 14 days of anlotinib treatment. HE staining and immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 and CD31 were performed on the tumour tissues from the mice. We collected anlotinib-treated and untreated C643 cell samples for subsequent transcriptome sequencing and analysis. Western blotting was conducted to measure the protein expression of c-MET, p-MET, LAMC2, COL5A1, and ITGA2 in mouse tumour tissues and C643 cell samples. Anlotinib inhibited the growth of C643 and CAL-62 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Anlotinib also induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in C643 and CAL-62 cells (p < 0.05). Anlotinib significantly reduced the migration and invasion of C643 and CAL-62 cells (p < 0.001). Moreover, anlotinib effectively suppressed the growth of subcutaneously transplanted tumours in mice (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 and CD31 demonstrated that anlotinib significantly inhibited tumour cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, anlotinib downregulated the protein expression of p-MET, LAMC2, COL5A1, and ITGA2 in mouse tumour tissues and C643 cells (p < 0.05). This study confirmed the therapeutic effect of anlotinib on ATC via in vivo and in vitro experiments.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a ""cold"" immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored ""hot"" inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.",AI in Oncology,immune checkpoint inhibitors icis present clinical benefits many cancer patients invariably fail glioblastoma gbm common deadly primary brain tumor lack icis efficacy gbm attributed accumulation tumorreprogrammed gliomaassociated myeloid cells gams create cold immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment tme impeding infiltration activation effector cells gbmderived vvintegrin ligands including spp shown mediate emergence gams hypothesized combination strategy aiming block reprogramming gams using synthetic aargd peptide targets sppintegrin signaling might overcome resistance icis reinvigorate antitumor immunity matrigel invasion assay used test efficacy aargd gliomamicroglia cocultures determined impact aargd administered monotherapy combined pd blockade tumor growth gams accumulation phenotypes arginase levels neovasculature experimental gliomas effects treatments tumor immune landscape dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry immunocytochemistry cytokine profiling rnaseq analysis sorted gams followed citeseq based data deconvolution aargd efficiently blocked microgliadependent invasion human mouse glioma cells vitro intratumorally delivered aargd alone reduce tumor growth orthotopic gliomas prevented emergence immunosuppressive gams led normalization peritumoral blood vessels combining aargd antipd antibody resulted reduced tumor growth increase number proliferating interferon producing cdsupsupt cells depletion regulatory cells transcriptomic profiles myeloid cells altered combined treatment reflecting restored hot inflammatory tme boosted immunotherapy responses intratumoral administration aargd similarly modified phenotypes gams human umg gliomas immunocompromised mice exploration transcriptomic datasets revealed high expression integrin receptor coding genes pretreatment biopsies associated poorer response immune checkpoint blockade patients several types cancers demonstrate combining blockade sppintegrin signaling icis modifies innate immunity reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses paves way improve immunotherapy outcomes gbm,AI in Oncology
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently recurs after surgical treatment, necessitating effective postoperative recurrence management for improved long-term patient outcomes. Currently, no standardized treatment approach exists for recurrent unresectable HCC. This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of combining tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment of recurrent unresectable HCC. A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 83 patients diagnosed with unresectable recurrent HCC. Patients were categorized into three groups based on their treatment regimens: HAIC combined with TKIs and PD-1 inhibitors (HTP), TACE combined with TKIs and PD-1 inhibitors (TTP), and TACE alone. Treatment efficacy and safety were compared among these groups, and potential risk factors were identified. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for patients in the HTP group, TTP group, and TACE alone group was found to be 13.7, 9.2, and 2.5 months (p = 0.001, p = 0.002).

"Anti-HER2 antibodies are effective but often lead to resistance in patients with HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we report an epigenetic crosstalk with aberrant glycerophospholipid metabolism and inflammation as a key resistance mechanism of anti-HER2 therapies in HER2+ breast cancer. Histone reader ZMYND8 specifically confers resistance to cancer cells against trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab. Mechanistically, ZMYND8 enhances cPLA2α expression in resistant tumor cells through inducing c-Myc. cPLA2α inactivates phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C to inhibit phosphatidylcholine breakdown into diacylglycerol, which diminishes protein kinase C activity leading to interleukin-27 secretion. Supplementation with interleukin-27 protein counteracts cPLA2α loss to reinforce trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ tumor cells and patient-derived organoids. Upregulation of ZMYND8, c-Myc, cPLA2α, and IL-27 is prevalent in HER2+ breast cancer patients following HER2-targeted therapies. Targeting c-Myc or cPLA2α effectively overcomes anti-HER2 therapy resistance in patient-derived xenografts.

"Ovarian cancer is associated with high rates of patient mortality and morbidity. Laparoscopic assessment of tumor localization can be used for treatment planning in newly diagnosed high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). While spread to multiple intra-abdominal areas is correlated with worse outcomes, whether other morphological tumor differences are also associated with patient outcomes is unknown. Given the large volume of visual information in laparoscopic videos, we investigated whether deep-learning models can capture implicit features and predict treatment outcomes. We developed a novel deep-learning framework using pre-treatment laparoscopic images to assess clinical outcomes following upfront standard treatment, defined as short progression-free survival (PFS) (< 8 months) or long PFS (> 12 months). The deep-learning framework consisted of contrastive pre-training to capture morphological features of images and a location-aware transformer to predict patient-level treatment outcomes. We trained and extensively evaluated the model using cross-validation and analyzed the extracted features via UMAP visualizations and Grad-CAM saliency maps. The model reached an AUROC of 0.819 (± 0.119) on fivefold cross-validation and an out-of-fold AUROC of 0.807 on the whole dataset, successfully discriminating between patients with short PFS and long PFS using only laparoscopic images.

"Ovarian cancer (OV) has the highest mortality rate among gynecological cancers. As OV progresses, tumor cells spread outside the ovaries to the peritoneal and abdominal cavities, forming cell clusters that float in the ascitic fluid caused by peritonitis carcinomatosa, leading to further dissemination and metastasis. These cell clusters are enriched with cancer stem cells (CSCs) which are responsible for treatment resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Therefore, targeting CSCs is a potentially effective approach for treating OV. However, understanding how CSCs acquire treatment resistance and identifying targets against CSCs remains challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that 3D-spheroids of OV cell lines exhibit higher stemness than conventional adherent cells. Metabolomics profiling studies have revealed that 3D-spheroids maintain a high-energy state through increased glucose utilization in the citric acid cycle (TCA), efficient nucleotide phosphorylation, and elevated phosphocreatine as an energy buffer. We also found that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme for NAD<sup>+</sup> production, is highly expressed in OV. Furthermore, the approach based on NAMPT dependence rather than histology found NAMPT to be a potential therapeutic target against CSCs, while also serving as a prognostic indicator in OV. Moreover, we identified a previously unrecognized anti-tumor mechanism whereby disulfiram, an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor, synergistically inhibited mitochondrial function when combined with NAMPT inhibitors - leading to cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Finally, the combination of a NAMPT inhibitor and disulfiram showed significant anti-tumor effects and extended survival in an animal model.

"More than 90% of advanced gastric cancers (GC) are microsatellite-stable (MSS). Compared to the high response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) GCs, only 10% of unstratified MSS GCs respond to ICIs. In this study, we apply semi-supervised learning to stratify potential ICI responders in MSS GCs, achieving high accuracy, quantified by an area under the curve of 0.924. Spatial analysis of the tumor microenvironment of ICI-sensitive GCs reveals a high level of T-bet+ CD8 + T cell infiltration in their tumor compartments. T-bet+ CD8 + T cells exhibit superior anti-tumor activity due to their increased ability to infiltrate tumors and secrete cytotoxic molecules. Adoptive transfer of T-bet+ CD8 + T cells boosts anti-tumor immunity and confers susceptibility to ICIs in immune-ignorant MSS GCs in a humanized mouse model. Spatial RNA sequencing suggests a positive-feedback loop between T-bet+ T cells and PD-L1+ tumor cells, which eventually drives T cell exhaustion and can therefore be leveraged for ICI therapy. In summary, our research provides insights into the underlying mechanism of anti-tumor immunity and deepens our understanding of varied ICI responses in MSS GCs.",AI in Oncology,advanced gastric cancers gc microsatellitestable mss compared high response rate immune checkpoint inhibitors ici microsatelliteinstabilityhigh msih gcs unstratified mss gcs respond icis study apply semisupervised learning stratify potential ici responders mss gcs achieving high accuracy quantified area curve spatial analysis tumor microenvironment icisensitive gcs reveals high level tbet cd cell infiltration tumor compartments tbet cd cells exhibit superior antitumor activity due increased ability infiltrate tumors secrete cytotoxic molecules adoptive transfer tbet cd cells boosts antitumor immunity confers susceptibility icis immuneignorant mss gcs humanized mouse model spatial rna sequencing suggests positivefeedback loop tbet cells pdl tumor cells eventually drives cell exhaustion therefore leveraged ici therapy summary research provides insights underlying mechanism antitumor immunity deepens understanding varied ici responses mss gcs,AI in Oncology
"The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway has significantly transformed the landscape of cancer treatment. However, resistance mechanisms such as alternative immune checkpoints, T-cell exhaustion, low tumor burden, and immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment can limit therapeutic efficacy. Recent research has highlighted the role of tumor-derived exosomes expressing PD-L1, which may contribute to resistance by locally and systemically suppressing immune responses. Inhibiting exosome secretion has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The therapeutic potential of targeting exosomes to improve PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition is gaining attention, with preclinical studies showing encouraging results.

"Islet auto transplantation (IAT) is a potential therapeutic option for patients undergoing pancreatectomy to preserve endocrine function, but its role in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) remains controversial due to oncological concerns. This study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and metabolic outcomes of IAT in seven patients with focal IPMN who underwent pancreatectomy between 2008 and 2023, following the Milan protocol. Primary outcomes included the technical success of islet isolation and the absence of tumor dissemination. Secondary outcomes involved insulin independence and metabolic control post-transplantation. Islet isolation success was variable, with four patients meeting the criteria for transplantation. The average islet yield was 1,097 islet equivalents per kilogram of body weight (range: 219-1,833 IEQ/kg). No patients experienced complications related to islet infusion, and there was no evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis during a mean follow-up of 7.9 years (range: 3.99-11.88 years). IAT recipients demonstrated preserved insulin secretion, while non-transplanted patients developed diabetes. These findings support the feasibility and safety of IAT in carefully selected patients with focal IPMN, providing promising metabolic outcomes. The results open the possibility to initiate larger cohort studies and explore the potential to expand the population of patients who could benefit from this approach.",AI in Oncology,islet auto transplantation iat potential therapeutic option patients undergoing pancreatectomy preserve endocrine function role patients intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ipmn remains controversial due oncological concerns study evaluates feasibility safety metabolic outcomes iat seven patients focal ipmn underwent pancreatectomy following milan protocol primary outcomes included technical success islet isolation absence tumor dissemination secondary outcomes involved insulin independence metabolic control posttransplantation islet isolation success variable four patients meeting criteria transplantation average islet yield islet equivalents per kilogram body weight range ieqkg patients experienced complications related islet infusion evidence tumor recurrence metastasis mean followup years range years iat recipients demonstrated preserved insulin secretion nontransplanted patients developed diabetes findings support feasibility safety iat carefully selected patients focal ipmn providing promising metabolic outcomes results open possibility initiate larger cohort studies explore potential expand population patients could benefit approach,AI in Oncology
"Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) represents one of the most severe complications of colorectal cancer (CRC), often associated with unfavorable prognosis. The herbal formulation Kang-Ai-Jing-Fang (KAJF) has been employed clinically against CRC for several decades, although its precise mechanism of action remains elusive. This study investigates the anti-metastatic potential of KAJF in CRLM, focusing on its modulatory effects on gut microbiota and inhibition of M2-like macrophage activation. KAJF was administered orally to CRLM model mice established through intrasplenic injection of murine CRC cells. To elucidate the role of gut microbiota reshaped by KAJF, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was utilized to assess its impact on CRLM inhibition. Core targets and active compounds were identified through network pharmacology and molecular docking. To characterize microbiota composition, metabolite profiles, and gene expression variations, 16S rRNA sequencing, untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics, and transcriptomics analyses were performed. KAJF demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on CRLM and ameliorated gut microbiota dysbiosis by enhancing the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium). The therapeutic efficacy of KAJF-induced bacterial alterations in delaying CRLM and promoting butyrate-producing microbiota enrichment was further substantiated by FMT. Network pharmacology identified active ingredients in KAJF, including asperulosidic acid, polyphyllin II, ganoderenic acid B, calycosin, and ganoderic acid C, which exhibit substantial interactions with TLR4, PPARγ, SIRT1, PTGS2, and TNF. Molecular dynamics simulations and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis demonstrated that ganoderic acid C2 exhibits a strong binding affinity for PPARγ. Moreover, KAJF administration led to a marked reduction in F4/80<sup>+</sup> CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophages and their associated cytokines (CCL17, CCL22, IL10, IL4, TGF), accompanied by a decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), while increasing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations. This study demonstrates that KAJF mitigates CRLM, primarily through the regulation of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites, alongside inhibition of M2-like macrophage polarization. By integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics, and network pharmacology, this research elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning KAJF's therapeutic effects against CRLM, offering a promising approach for clinical intervention.",AI in Oncology,colorectal cancer liver metastasis crlm represents one severe complications colorectal cancer crc often associated unfavorable prognosis herbal formulation kangaijingfang kajf employed clinically crc several decades although precise mechanism action remains elusive study investigates antimetastatic potential kajf crlm focusing modulatory effects gut microbiota inhibition mlike macrophage activation kajf administered orally crlm model mice established intrasplenic injection murine crc cells elucidate role gut microbiota reshaped kajf fecal microbiota transplantation fmt utilized assess impact crlm inhibition core targets active compounds identified network pharmacology molecular docking characterize microbiota composition metabolite profiles gene expression variations rrna sequencing untargeted liquid chromatographymass spectrometry lcmsms metabolomics transcriptomics analyses performed kajf demonstrated significant inhibitory effects crlm ameliorated gut microbiota dysbiosis enhancing abundance butyrateproducing bacteria lactobacillus bacteroides bifidobacterium therapeutic efficacy kajfinduced bacterial alterations delaying crlm promoting butyrateproducing microbiota enrichment substantiated fmt network pharmacology identified active ingredients kajf including asperulosidic acid polyphyllin ii ganoderenic acid b calycosin ganoderic acid c exhibit substantial interactions tlr ppar sirt ptgs tnf molecular dynamics simulations surface plasmon resonance spr analysis demonstrated ganoderic acid c exhibits strong binding affinity ppar moreover kajf administration led marked reduction fsupsup cdsupsup macrophages associated cytokines ccl ccl il il tgf accompanied decrease cdsupsup cells myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs increasing cdsupsup cell populations study demonstrates kajf mitigates crlm primarily regulation gut microbiota microbial metabolites alongside inhibition mlike macrophage polarization integrating metabolomics transcriptomics network pharmacology research elucidates molecular mechanisms underpinning kajfs therapeutic effects crlm offering promising approach clinical intervention,AI in Oncology
"The long non-coding RNA SLNCR and the transcription factor E2F1 are known melanoma oncogenes. We show that SLNCR binds to E2F1 to promote the proliferation, invasion, and migration of melanoma cells from the bloodstream into the lungs. Blocking SLNCR-E2F1 complex formation without reducing the levels of either SLNCR or E2F1 prevents lung extravasation in mice. A 60-nt fragment of SLNCR contains two RNA analogs of the E2F1 DNA binding site (BS) in opposite orientations and can form a hairpin RNA that phenocopies the E2F1 DNA BS. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biochemical experiments indicate that this fragment of SLNCR binds to the E2F1 DNA-binding domain more effectively than the E2F1 DNA BS. MD simulations predict higher affinity for DNA-E2F1 complex formation but faster kinetics and a greater number of RNA-amino acid contacts for the RNA-E2F1 complex, suggesting that RNA binding to E2F1 is more kinetically favorable.",AI in Oncology,long noncoding rna slncr transcription factor ef known melanoma oncogenes show slncr binds ef promote proliferation invasion migration melanoma cells bloodstream lungs blocking slncref complex formation without reducing levels either slncr ef prevents lung extravasation mice nt fragment slncr contains two rna analogs ef dna binding site bs opposite orientations form hairpin rna phenocopies ef dna bs molecular dynamics md simulations biochemical experiments indicate fragment slncr binds ef dnabinding domain effectively ef dna bs md simulations predict higher affinity dnaef complex formation faster kinetics greater number rnaamino acid contacts rnaef complex suggesting rna binding ef kinetically favorable,AI in Oncology
"Cellular senescence regulates aging, tissue maintenance, and disease progression through the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a secretory profile of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling enzymes. While transient SASP aids wound healing, its chronic activation drives inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. This review examines SASP's molecular regulation, dual roles in health and pathology, and therapeutic potential. The following two main strategies are explored: senescence clearance, which eliminates SASP-producing cells, and SASP modulation, which refines secretion to suppress inflammation while maintaining regenerative effects. Key pathways, including NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and cGAS-STING, are discussed alongside pharmacological, immunotherapeutic, gene-editing, and epigenetic interventions. SASP heterogeneity necessitates tissue-specific biomarkers for personalized therapies. Challenges include immune interactions, long-term safety, and ethical considerations.

"Lung cancer with the highest number of new cases diagnosed in Europe and in Poland, remains an example of malignancy with a very poor prognosis despite the recent progress in medicine. Different treatment strategies are now available for cancer therapy based on its type, molecular subtype and other factors including overall health, the stage of disease and cancer molecular profile. Immunotherapy is emerging as a potential addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other targeted therapies, but also considered a mainstay therapy mode. This combination is an area of active investigation in order to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance. Due to the complexity and dynamic of cancer's ecosystem, novel therapeutic targets and strategies need continued research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms within the tumour microenvironment. From the genetic point of view, several signatures ranging from a few mutated genes to hundreds of them have been identified and associated with therapy resistance and metastatic potential. ML techniques and AI can enhance the predictive potential of genetic signatures and model the prognosis. Here, we present the overview of already existing treatment approaches, the current findings of key aspects of immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), existing molecular biomarkers like PD-L1 expression, tumour mutation burden, immunoscore, and neoantigens, as well as their roles as predictive markers for treatment response and resistance.",AI in Oncology,lung cancer highest number new cases diagnosed europe poland remains example malignancy poor prognosis despite recent progress medicine different treatment strategies available cancer therapy based type molecular subtype factors including overall health stage disease cancer molecular profile immunotherapy emerging potential addition surgery chemotherapy radiotherapy targeted therapies also considered mainstay therapy mode combination area active investigation order enhance efficacy overcome resistance due complexity dynamic cancers ecosystem novel therapeutic targets strategies need continued research cellular molecular mechanisms within tumour microenvironment genetic point view several signatures ranging mutated genes hundreds identified associated therapy resistance metastatic potential ml techniques ai enhance predictive potential genetic signatures model prognosis present overview already existing treatment approaches current findings key aspects immunotherapy immune checkpoint inhibitors icis existing molecular biomarkers like pdl expression tumour mutation burden immunoscore neoantigens well roles predictive markers treatment response resistance,AI in Oncology
"<i>p53</i> is a tumor suppressor gene and is regarded as one of the most crucial genes in protecting humans against cancer. The protein Mdm2 and its homolog MdmX serve as negative regulators of p53. In nearly half of cancer cells, there is an overexpression of Mdm2 and MdmX, which inhibit p53 activity. Furthermore, Mdm2's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Therefore, blocking the interaction between p53 and Mdm2/MdmX to prevent the degradation of wild-type p53 is an effective strategy for inhibiting tumor growth. This paper primarily discusses the regulatory relationship between p53, MdmX and Mdm2, and provides a review of the current status of p53-Mdm2/MdmX inhibitors. It aims to offer a theoretical foundation and research direction for the future discovery and design of targeted inhibitors against the p53-Mdm2/MdmX interaction.",AI in Oncology,ipi tumor suppressor gene regarded one crucial genes protecting humans cancer protein mdm homolog mdmx serve negative regulators p nearly half cancer cells overexpression mdm mdmx inhibit p activity furthermore mdms e ubiquitin ligase activity promotes ubiquitination degradation p therefore blocking interaction p mdmmdmx prevent degradation wildtype p effective strategy inhibiting tumor growth paper primarily discusses regulatory relationship p mdmx mdm provides review current status pmdmmdmx inhibitors aims offer theoretical foundation research direction future discovery design targeted inhibitors pmdmmdmx interaction,AI in Oncology
"Cancer remains a leading cause of death globally, characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor growth and metastasis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their growth differentiation factor (GDF) relatives are crucial regulators of developmental processes such as limb, kidney and lung formation, cell fate determination, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of self-renewing cells within tumors that possess stemness properties and a tumor cell-forming capability. The presence of CSCs in a tumor is linked to growth, metastasis, treatment resistance and cancer recurrence. The tumor microenvironment in which CSCs exist also plays a critical role in the onset, progression and treatment resistance in many cancers. Growth factors such as BMPs and GDFs counterbalance transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in the maintenance of CSC pluripotency and cancer cell differentiation. BMP signaling typically functions in a tumor suppressor role in various cancers by inducing CSC differentiation and suppressing stemness characteristics. This differentiation process is vital, as it curtails the self-renewal capacity that characterizes CSCs, thereby limiting their ability to sustain tumor growth. The interplay between BMPs and their secreted antagonists, such as GREM1, Noggin and Chordin, adds another layer of complexity to CSC regulation. Human cancers such as gastric, colorectal, glioblastoma, and breast cancer are characterized by GREMLIN1 (GREM1) overexpression, leading to inhibition of BMP signaling, facilitating the maintenance of pluripotency in CSCs, thus promoting tumorigenesis. GREM1 overexpression may also contribute to CSC immune evasion, further exacerbating patient prognoses. In addition to BMP inhibition, GREM1 has been implicated as a target of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) → Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, as well as the Wnt/Frizzled pathway, both of which may contribute to the maintenance of CSC stemness. The complex role of BMPs and their antagonists in regulating CSC behavior underscores the importance of a balanced BMP signaling pathway. This article will summarize current knowledge of BMP and GREM1 regulation of CSC function, as well as conflicting data on the exact role of GREM1 in modulating CSC biology, tumor formation and cancer. Targeting this pathway by inhibiting GREM1 using neutralizing antibodies or small molecules may hold early-stage promise for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing CSC burden in cancers and improving patient outcomes.",AI in Oncology,cancer remains leading cause death globally characterized uncontrolled cell proliferation tumor growth metastasis bone morphogenetic proteins bmps growth differentiation factor gdf relatives crucial regulators developmental processes limb kidney lung formation cell fate determination cell proliferation apoptosis cancer stem cells cscs subpopulation selfrenewing cells within tumors possess stemness properties tumor cellforming capability presence cscs tumor linked growth metastasis treatment resistance cancer recurrence tumor microenvironment cscs exist also plays critical role onset progression treatment resistance many cancers growth factors bmps gdfs counterbalance transforming growth factorbeta tgf maintenance csc pluripotency cancer cell differentiation bmp signaling typically functions tumor suppressor role various cancers inducing csc differentiation suppressing stemness characteristics differentiation process vital curtails selfrenewal capacity characterizes cscs thereby limiting ability sustain tumor growth interplay bmps secreted antagonists grem noggin chordin adds another layer complexity csc regulation human cancers gastric colorectal glioblastoma breast cancer characterized gremlin grem overexpression leading inhibition bmp signaling facilitating maintenance pluripotency cscs thus promoting tumorigenesis grem overexpression may also contribute csc immune evasion exacerbating patient prognoses addition bmp inhibition grem implicated target fibroblast growth factor fgf sonic hedgehog shh signaling well wntfrizzled pathway may contribute maintenance csc stemness complex role bmps antagonists regulating csc behavior underscores importance balanced bmp signaling pathway article summarize current knowledge bmp grem regulation csc function well conflicting data exact role grem modulating csc biology tumor formation cancer targeting pathway inhibiting grem using neutralizing antibodies small molecules may hold earlystage promise novel therapeutic strategies aimed reducing csc burden cancers improving patient outcomes,AI in Oncology
"There has been a proliferation of novel treatments for the management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa), including androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI). Although there are health economic analyses of novel PCa treatments, such as ARPIs for specific health states, there is a lack of sequential analyses. Our paper aims to fill this gap. We developed a Monte Carlo Markov model to simulate the management of advanced PCa to end-of-life. We modeled patients who begin in metastatic and nonmetastatic castration-sensitive PCa (mCSPC and nmCSPC), with risk stratification for mCSPC, progressing to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC). Using current guidelines and recent literature, we simulated admissible treatment sequences over these states along a 15-year horizon. We report the best treatment sequences in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We find that the most cost-effective use of ARPIs is early in advanced PCa for a cost-effectiveness threshold (CET) of CAD 100K per QALY. For a CET of CAD 50K per QALY, early ARPI use is most cost-effective in mCSPC-starting patients but not nmCSPC-starting. We conclude that the most cost-effective way to use ARPIs is when patients first enter advanced PCa. The most cost-effective ARPI at current Canadian prices is abiraterone, mostly due to abiraterone's lower price level.",AI in Oncology,proliferation novel treatments management advanced prostate cancer pca including androgen receptor pathway inhibitors arpi although health economic analyses novel pca treatments arpis specific health states lack sequential analyses paper aims fill gap developed monte carlo markov model simulate management advanced pca endoflife modeled patients begin metastatic nonmetastatic castrationsensitive pca mcspc nmcspc risk stratification mcspc progressing metastatic castrationresistant pca mcrpc using current guidelines recent literature simulated admissible treatment sequences states along year horizon report best treatment sequences terms efficacy costeffectiveness find costeffective use arpis early advanced pca costeffectiveness threshold cet cad k per qaly cet cad k per qaly early arpi use costeffective mcspcstarting patients nmcspcstarting conclude costeffective way use arpis patients first enter advanced pca costeffective arpi current canadian prices abiraterone mostly due abiraterones lower price level,AI in Oncology
"The combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy has demonstrated synergistic potential, especially when a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is administered. Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors or Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have been assessed in both clinical and preclinical studies; the addition of radiotherapy activates immunomodulatory mechanisms materialized by an effect similar to ""in situ"" vaccination or the ""abscopal"" distant response of lesions outside the irradiation field.

"Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), initially identified as a neuronal guidance protein, has emerged as a multifaceted regulator in cancer biology. Beyond its role in axonal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is increasingly recognized for its significant impact on tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review explores the diverse functions of NRP1 in cancer, encompassing its influence on tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. NRP1 interacts with several key signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), semaphorins, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, NRP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in various malignancies, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Therapeutically, targeting NRP1 holds promise as a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of regular treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Strategies involving NRP1-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and gene silencing techniques, are being actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. Despite challenges in specificity and delivery, advances in understanding NRP1 biology offer new avenues for personalized cancer therapy. Although several types of cancer cells can express NRPs, the role of NRPs in tumor pathogenesis is largely unknown. Future investigations are needed to enhance our understanding of the effects and mechanisms of NRPs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of neuronal, endothelial, and cancer cells. The novel frameworks or multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple databases to better understand cancer's molecular and clinical features, develop personalized therapies, and help identify biomarkers.

"<b>Background:</b> Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is a hyperinflammatory state triggered by immune therapies like CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs). Characterized by excessive cytokine release, CRS often mimics infectious and inflammatory conditions, complicating diagnosis and treatment. Immunosuppressive therapies used for CRS further elevate the risk of secondary infections. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE was conducted using terms related to ""cytokine release syndrome"", ""cytokine storm"", ""infections"", and ""management"". Studies were included if they described infectious complications, diagnostic mimics, or therapeutic approaches related to CRS. <b>Results:</b> Of 19,634 studies, 2572 abstracts were reviewed. Infections occurred in up to 23% of patients post-CAR T therapy and 24% post-BiTE therapy. Pathogens included gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, herpesviruses (e.g., CMV, HSV), fungi (e.g., <i>Candida</i>, <i>Aspergillus</i>), and parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii). CRS mimics also included non-infectious inflammatory syndromes. Differentiation remains challenging, but cytokine profiling and biomarkers (e.g., ferritin, CRP, sIL-2Rα) may aid in diagnosis. Treatments included tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and empiric antimicrobials. Prophylactic strategies were inconsistently reported. <b>Conclusions:</b> Effective CRS management requires early recognition, differentiation from infectious mimics, and collaboration between oncology and infectious disease (ID) specialists.

AI has notably improved early detection, achieving up to 95% accuracy in cervical cancer screening through AI-enhanced Pap smear analysis and colposcopy. For ovarian and endometrial cancers, AI-driven imaging and biomarker detection have enabled more personalized treatment approaches. In addition, AI tools have enhanced precision in robotic-assisted surgery and radiotherapy, and AI-based histopathology has reduced diagnostic variability. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data privacy, bias, and the need for human oversight must be addressed.

"Cancer immunotherapy is based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and has brought a revolution in oncology with promising treatment possibilities for diverse cancers. Yet, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) frequently limit the clinical efficacy of ICIs, with cardiotoxicity representing a significant salient consequence. These ICI side-effects underscore the need for well-established models for the assessment of cardiac risk. This review proposes a risk evaluation strategy that uses biomarkers, non-invasive imaging, and individual patient data. The goal is to elucidate the mechanism through which immune-related adverse events affecting the heart might arise, and the need for predictive tools to better tailor treatment regimens to increase both safety and efficacy. Biomarkers play a vital role in the detection and prevention of heart-related side effects, which means adequate intervention while preserving therapeutic outcomes.

"This study aimed to compare the efficacy of first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) combined with low-dose bevacizumab(7.5 mg/kg) versus osimertinib as first-line treatment in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 161 patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations, who received first-line treatment at Shanghai Chest Hospital between July 2017 and July 2023, were enrolled in this study. Among them, 78 patients were treated with a combination of first-generation EGFR-TKIs and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), constituting the bevacizumab plus TKI (A + T) group. The remaining 83 patients received osimertinib monotherapy (80 mg daily), forming the osimertinib group. The objective response rate (ORR) was 65.4% (51/78) in the A + T group and 68.7% (57/83) in the osimertinib group (<i>p</i> = 0.657). Despite the potentially poorer baseline conditions of patients in the osimertinib group, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16.59 months (95% CI: 14.39-18.80) in the A + T group compared to 16.82 months (95% CI: 13.76-19.89) in the osimertinib group (<i>p</i> = 0.792). Preliminary overall survival (OS) analysis indicated a median OS of 51.75 months (95% CI: 41.63-61.86) in the A + T group versus 35.55 months (95% CI: 22.32-48.77) in the osimertinib group (<i>p</i> = 0.010), however, the OS data are not yet mature.

"Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy and a major health concern in Korea. Although colonoscopy is an effective tool for screening and preventing colorectal cancer through the early detection of pre-cancerous lesions, many factors influence the quality of colonoscopy, including fatigue, experience, inter-observer variation, and human error. Minimizing errors and providing consistent performance improves the quality of colonoscopy, which can lower cancer-related mortality. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the application of computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) of neoplastic polyps, such as adenomas, and computer-aided quality assessment (CAQ), which involves monitoring withdrawal time, assessing cecal insertion, and ensuring sufficient colonic surface observation. Many AI models have been developed, and some CADe and CADx systems have become commercially available, demonstrating their usefulness in detection of adenomas and characterization of polyps. Additionally, clinical studies on the usefulness of CAQ have been published. This innovative technology holds great potential to assist endoscopists and benefit the general population. In the future, an evaluation of the practical benefits and cost-effectiveness of applying AI models to colonoscopy in clinical practice seems necessary.",AI in Oncology,colorectal cancer common malignancy major health concern korea although colonoscopy effective tool screening preventing colorectal cancer early detection precancerous lesions many factors influence quality colonoscopy including fatigue experience interobserver variation human error minimizing errors providing consistent performance improves quality colonoscopy lower cancerrelated mortality advances artificial intelligence ai led application computeraided detection cade computeraided diagnosis cadx neoplastic polyps adenomas computeraided quality assessment caq involves monitoring withdrawal time assessing cecal insertion ensuring sufficient colonic surface observation many ai models developed cade cadx systems become commercially available demonstrating usefulness detection adenomas characterization polyps additionally clinical studies usefulness caq published innovative technology holds great potential assist endoscopists benefit general population future evaluation practical benefits costeffectiveness applying ai models colonoscopy clinical practice seems necessary,AI in Oncology
"Overexpression of the antiapoptotic oncogene <i>BCL-2</i> predicts poor prognosis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with anthracycline-based chemoimmunotherapy. Anthracyclines exert antitumor effects by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) through rRNA synthesis blockade. RiBi inhibitors induce p53 stabilization through the ribosomal proteins-MDM2-p53 pathway, with stabilized p53 levels depending on baseline rRNA synthesis rate. We found that the BH3-mimetic venetoclax could not fully reverse BCL-2-mediated resistance to RiBi inhibitors in DLBCL cells. BCL-2 overexpression was associated with decreased baseline rRNA synthesis rate, attenuating p53 stabilization by RiBi inhibitors. Drugs stabilizing p53 irrespective of RiBi inhibition reversed BCL-2-induced resistance <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, restoring p53 activation and apoptosis. A small nucleolar size, indicative of low baseline rRNA synthesis, correlated with high BCL-2 levels and poor outcomes in DLBCL patients.

"Despite therapeutic benefits of anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low response rates and resistance limit its efficacy. Both manganese (Mn) and bisphosphonates (BPs) are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). Strategies to synergistically enhance ICD induction and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully explored. We analyzed the mode of apoptosis and immunogenicity of cancer cells post-treatment using Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. RNA sequencing was employed to identify activated apoptotic pathways and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ICD when Mn²<sup>+</sup> and BPs act synergistically. In 4T1 tumor models, we evaluated the synergistic anti-tumor effect of Mn²<sup>+</sup> and BPs with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. By leveraging the doping capacity of hydroxyapatite (HA) for Mn²<sup>+</sup> and its high affinity for BPs, we developed MnHARis particles-a biocompatible slow-release system of biomineralized Mn²<sup>+</sup> and risedronate (Ris). Compared to Mn2+ and Ris alone, MnHARis achieved a synergistic antitumor effect, manifesting as increased cytotoxicity (IC50 reduced by 17 times) and the emergence of more significant mitochondrial autophagic apoptosis (more pronounced nuclear fragmentation, increased ROS levels, significantly decreased ATP levels, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of autophagy markers (LC3B and Beclin), and obvious autophagosomes). MnHARis exerts its antitumor effects via the p38-MAPK pathway. Additionally, increased exposure of calreticulin and increased secretion of high mobility group box 1 indicated that MnHARis successfully induced ICD and promoted specific recognition and cross-presentation of damage-associated molecular patterns released by apoptotic tumor cells by activating dendritic cells and pattern recognition receptors, thereby altering TME of TNBC, increasing TILs, and sensitizing TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. MnHARis effectively synergizes Mn²<sup>+</sup> and Ris to promote autophagic apoptosis and ICD, increasing TILs and sensitizing TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy, thus offering a new therapeutic strategy.",AI in Oncology,despite therapeutic benefits antiprogrammed deathligand pdl therapy triplenegative breast cancer tnbc low response rates resistance limit efficacy manganese mn bisphosphonates bps known induce immunogenic cell death icd strategies synergistically enhance icd induction elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms remain fully explored analyzed mode apoptosis immunogenicity cancer cells posttreatment using western blotting flow cytometry confocal microscopy rna sequencing employed identify activated apoptotic pathways elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying icd mnsupsup bps act synergistically tumor models evaluated synergistic antitumor effect mnsupsup bps antipdl antibodies leveraging doping capacity hydroxyapatite ha mnsupsup high affinity bps developed mnharis particlesa biocompatible slowrelease system biomineralized mnsupsup risedronate ris compared mn ris alone mnharis achieved synergistic antitumor effect manifesting increased cytotoxicity ic reduced times emergence significant mitochondrial autophagic apoptosis pronounced nuclear fragmentation increased ros levels significantly decreased atp levels depolarization mitochondrial membrane potential upregulation autophagy markers lcb beclin obvious autophagosomes mnharis exerts antitumor effects via pmapk pathway additionally increased exposure calreticulin increased secretion high mobility group box indicated mnharis successfully induced icd promoted specific recognition crosspresentation damageassociated molecular patterns released apoptotic tumor cells activating dendritic cells pattern recognition receptors thereby altering tme tnbc increasing tils sensitizing tnbc antipdl therapy mnharis effectively synergizes mnsupsup ris promote autophagic apoptosis icd increasing tils sensitizing tnbc antipdl therapy thus offering new therapeutic strategy,AI in Oncology
"Selpercatinib is a selective rearranged during transfection (RET) inhibitor approved for treating RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), demonstrating high efficacy in central nervous system involvement. This case report describes a 65-year-old woman with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma who, after progression on third-line therapy, developed severe neurological symptoms, including hypoacusis, headache, and dizziness, attributed to cerebral and bilateral internal auditory canal metastasis. This study received a favorable opinion from the ethics committee of the Cova da Beira Local Health Unit and informed consent was obtained from the patient in question. Next-generation sequencing identified a RET fusion mutation, leading to the initiation of selpercatinib as a fourth-line treatment. The patient exhibited significant clinical improvement within one week of therapy, including complete hearing recovery. Adverse effects were limited to elevated hepatic transaminases and QT interval prolongation, both of which were effectively managed through dose adjustments. The response to selpercatinib was sustained for over 31 months, at which point new brain metastasis developed, which was possible to address with whole-brain radiotherapy while maintaining targeted therapy with selpercatinib. This case highlights a rare presentation of bilateral auditory canal metastasis in NSCLC with RET fusion, following the failure of platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The prolonged progression-free survival and favorable tolerability of selpercatinib, after dose modifications, underscore its potential as an effective treatment option for patients with central nervous system metastasis.",AI in Oncology,selpercatinib selective rearranged transfection ret inhibitor approved treating ret fusionpositive nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc demonstrating high efficacy central nervous system involvement case report describes yearold woman stage iv lung adenocarcinoma progression thirdline therapy developed severe neurological symptoms including hypoacusis headache dizziness attributed cerebral bilateral internal auditory canal metastasis study received favorable opinion ethics committee cova da beira local health unit informed consent obtained patient question nextgeneration sequencing identified ret fusion mutation leading initiation selpercatinib fourthline treatment patient exhibited significant clinical improvement within one week therapy including complete hearing recovery adverse effects limited elevated hepatic transaminases qt interval prolongation effectively managed dose adjustments response selpercatinib sustained months point new brain metastasis developed possible address wholebrain radiotherapy maintaining targeted therapy selpercatinib case highlights rare presentation bilateral auditory canal metastasis nsclc ret fusion following failure platinumbased chemotherapy immunotherapy prolonged progressionfree survival favorable tolerability selpercatinib dose modifications underscore potential effective treatment option patients central nervous system metastasis,AI in Oncology
"Synthetic lethality represents a promising therapeutic approach in precision oncology, yet systematic identification of clinically relevant synthetic lethal interactions remains challenging. Here, we present SLAYER (Synthetic Lethality AnalYsis for Enhanced taRgeted therapy), a computational framework that integrates cancer genomic data and genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens to identify potential synthetic lethal interactions. SLAYER employs parallel analytical approaches examining both direct mutation-dependency associations and pathway-mediated relationships across 1080 cancer cell lines. Our integrative method identified 682 putative interactions, which were refined to 148 high-confidence candidates through stringent filtering for effect size, druggability, and clinical prevalence. Systematic validation against protein interaction databases revealed an ∼14-fold enrichment of known associations among SLAYER predictions compared with random gene pairs. Through pathway-level analysis, we identified inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as potentially synthetically lethal with RB1 mutations in bladder cancer. Experimental studies demonstrated selective sensitivity to AhR inhibition in RB1-mutant versus wild-type bladder cancer cells, which probably operates through indirect pathway-mediated mechanisms rather than direct genetic interaction. In summary, by integrating mutation profiles, gene dependencies, and pathway relationships, our approach provides a resource for investigating genetic vulnerabilities across cancer types.",AI in Oncology,synthetic lethality represents promising therapeutic approach precision oncology yet systematic identification clinically relevant synthetic lethal interactions remains challenging present slayer synthetic lethality analysis enhanced targeted therapy computational framework integrates cancer genomic data genomewide crispr knockout screens identify potential synthetic lethal interactions slayer employs parallel analytical approaches examining direct mutationdependency associations pathwaymediated relationships across cancer cell lines integrative method identified putative interactions refined highconfidence candidates stringent filtering effect size druggability clinical prevalence systematic validation protein interaction databases revealed fold enrichment known associations among slayer predictions compared random gene pairs pathwaylevel analysis identified inhibition aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr potentially synthetically lethal rb mutations bladder cancer experimental studies demonstrated selective sensitivity ahr inhibition rbmutant versus wildtype bladder cancer cells probably operates indirect pathwaymediated mechanisms rather direct genetic interaction summary integrating mutation profiles gene dependencies pathway relationships approach provides resource investigating genetic vulnerabilities across cancer types,AI in Oncology
"This study aims to fill the knowledge gap in systematically mapping the evolution of omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research through a bibliometric lens. While omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)provide multidimensional molecular profiling, their synergistic potential with immunotherapy remains underexplored in large-scale trend analyses. A comprehensive search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection for literature related to omics in tumor immunotherapy, up to August 2024. Bibliometric analyses, conducted using R version 4.3.3, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and Citespace 6.2, examined publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal distributions, keyword co-occurrence, and citation bursts. This analysis of 9,494 publications demonstrates rapid growth in omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research since 2019, with China leading in output (63% of articles) yet exhibiting limited multinational collaboration (7.9% vs. the UK's 61.8%). Keyword co-occurrence and citation burst analyses reveal evolving frontiers: early emphasis on ""PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade"" has transitioned toward ""machine learning,"" ""multi-omics,"" and ""lncRNA,"" reflecting a shift to predictive modeling and biomarker discovery. Multi-omics integration has facilitated the development of immune infiltration-based prognostic models, such as TIME subtypes, which have been validated across multiple tumor types, which inform clinical trial design (e.g. NCT06833723). Additionally, proteomic analysis of melanoma patients suggests that metabolic biomarkers, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, may stratify responders to PD-1 blockade therapy. Moreover, spatial omics has confirmed ENPP1 as a potential novel therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma. Citation trends underscore clinical translation, particularly mutation-guided therapies. Omics technologies are transforming tumor immunotherapy by enhancing biomarker discovery and improving therapeutic predictions.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the cancer types with poorest prognosis and survival rates primarily due to resistance to standard-of-care therapies, including gemcitabine (GEM) and olaparib. Particularly, wild-type (wt)BRCA tumours, the most prevalent in PDAC, are more resistant to DNA-targeting agents like olaparib, restraining their clinical application. Recently, we disclosed a monoterpene indole alkaloid derivative (BBIT20) as a new inhibitor of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair with anticancer activity in breast and ovarian cancer. Since inhibition of DNA repair enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, we aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of BBIT20 against PDAC, particularly carrying wtBRCA. In vitro and in vivo PDAC models, particularly human cell lines (including GEM-resistant PDAC cells), patient-derived organoids and xenograft mice of PDAC were used to evaluate the anticancer potential of BBIT20, alone and in combination with GEM or olaparib. Disruption of the BRCA1-BARD1 interaction by BBIT20 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and yeast two-hybrid assay. The potent antiproliferative activity of BBIT20, superior to olaparib, was demonstrated in PDAC cells regardless of BRCA status, by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage, while downregulating HR. The disruption of DNA double-strand breaks repair by BBIT20 was further reinforced by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) suppression. The inhibition of BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer by BBIT20 was demonstrated in PDAC cells and confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In GEM-resistant PDAC cells, BBIT20 showed potent antiproliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive activity, overcoming GEM resistance by inhibiting the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, upregulating the intracellular GEM-transporter ENT1, and downregulating GEM resistance-related microRNA-20a and GEM metabolism enzymes as RRM1/2. Furthermore, BBIT20 did not induce resistance in PDAC cells. It inhibited the growth of patient-derived PDAC organoids, by inducing apoptosis, repressing HR, and potentiating olaparib and GEM cytotoxicity. The enhancement of olaparib antitumor activity by BBIT20 was confirmed in xenograft mice of PDAC. Notably, it hindered tumour growth and liver metastasis formation, improving survival of orthotopic xenograft mice of PDAC. Furthermore, its potential as a stroma-targeting agent, reducing fibrotic extracellular matrix and overcoming desmoplasia, associated with an enhancement of immune cell response by depleting PD-L1 expression in tumour tissues, renders BBIT20 even more appealing for combination therapy, particularly with immunotherapy. These findings underscore the great potential of BBIT20 as a novel multifaceted anticancer drug candidate for PDAC treatment.",AI in Oncology,pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac among cancer types poorest prognosis survival rates primarily due resistance standardofcare therapies including gemcitabine gem olaparib particularly wildtype wtbrca tumours prevalent pdac resistant dnatargeting agents like olaparib restraining clinical application recently disclosed monoterpene indole alkaloid derivative bbit new inhibitor homologous recombination hr dna repair anticancer activity breast ovarian cancer since inhibition dna repair enhances sensitivity cancer cells chemotherapy aimed investigate anticancer potential bbit pdac particularly carrying wtbrca vitro vivo pdac models particularly human cell lines including gemresistant pdac cells patientderived organoids xenograft mice pdac used evaluate anticancer potential bbit alone combination gem olaparib disruption brcabard interaction bbit assessed coimmunoprecipitation immunofluorescence yeast twohybrid assay potent antiproliferative activity bbit superior olaparib demonstrated pdac cells regardless brca status inducing cell cycle arrest apoptosis dna damage downregulating hr disruption dna doublestrand breaks repair bbit reinforced nonhomologous end joining nhej suppression inhibition brcabard heterodimer bbit demonstrated pdac cells confirmed yeast twohybrid assay gemresistant pdac cells bbit showed potent antiproliferative antimigratory antiinvasive activity overcoming gem resistance inhibiting multidrug resistance pglycoprotein upregulating intracellular gemtransporter ent downregulating gem resistancerelated micrornaa gem metabolism enzymes rrm furthermore bbit induce resistance pdac cells inhibited growth patientderived pdac organoids inducing apoptosis repressing hr potentiating olaparib gem cytotoxicity enhancement olaparib antitumor activity bbit confirmed xenograft mice pdac notably hindered tumour growth liver metastasis formation improving survival orthotopic xenograft mice pdac furthermore potential stromatargeting agent reducing fibrotic extracellular matrix overcoming desmoplasia associated enhancement immune cell response depleting pdl expression tumour tissues renders bbit even appealing combination therapy particularly immunotherapy findings underscore great potential bbit novel multifaceted anticancer drug candidate pdac treatment,AI in Oncology
"Clinical data have shown that Serine/Threonine Kinase 11 (STK11) mutation may be associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITEM) and poor prognosis and failure of anti-PD-1 (αPD1) treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To explore the potential of restoring STK11 protein in immunotherapy, a bionic gene delivery system was prepared by coating the STK11-encoded DNA-cationic polymer complex core with the tumor cell membrane, termed STK11@PPCM. STK11@PPCM could specifically bind with NSCLC cells and achieve precise delivery of STK11-encoded DNA. The released DNA effectively restored the STK11 protein expression, consequently reactivating autophagy and immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. The liberated damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and autophagosome induced dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, which in turn enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration, M1 macrophage polarization, and proinflammatory factor expression, thereby reversing the ITEM. Moreover, STK11@PPCM was also found to improve the sensitivity of cancer cells to αPD1 by increasing the expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in STK11-mutated NSCLC cell xenografted mouse models, constructed by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology. This work demonstrated for the first time that restoration of functional STK11 can effectively reverse ITME and boost αPD1 efficacy in NSCLC, offering a new therapeutic approach for STK11-mutated lung adenocarcinoma in clinic.",AI in Oncology,clinical data shown serinethreonine kinase stk mutation may associated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment item poor prognosis failure antipd pd treatment nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc explore potential restoring stk protein immunotherapy bionic gene delivery system prepared coating stkencoded dnacationic polymer complex core tumor cell membrane termed stk stk could specifically bind nsclc cells achieve precise delivery stkencoded dna released dna effectively restored stk protein expression consequently reactivating autophagy immunogenic cell death icd cancer cells liberated damageassociated molecular patterns damps autophagosome induced dendritic cells dcs maturation turn enhanced cd cell infiltration macrophage polarization proinflammatory factor expression thereby reversing item moreover stk also found improve sensitivity cancer cells pd increasing expression pdl confirmed stkmutated nsclc cell xenografted mouse models constructed crisprcas knockout technology work demonstrated first time restoration functional stk effectively reverse itme boost pd efficacy nsclc offering new therapeutic approach stkmutated lung adenocarcinoma clinic,AI in Oncology
"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is highly challenging to treat due to its poor prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Liposomal nanotechnology has emerged as a promising drug delivery platform in oncology, but existing liposomal therapies face limitations such as systemic toxicity, insufficient tumor selectivity, and low target specificity. Mesothelin (MSLN), an antigen overexpressed in PAAD, has attracted attention as a potential target for precision therapy. Here, we present the development of an anti-MSLN nanobody (D3 Nb) with high binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.2 nM) that can selectively bind to MSLN-positive cancer cells. Structural analysis revealed that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds within the complementary determining region (CDR) of D3 Nb promote strong binding to MSLN, leading to significant inhibition of AKT/NF-κB signaling and downregulation of fibronectin 1 (FN1) and twist1, key drivers of PAAD oncogenicity. In vivo studies confirmed that D3 Nb alone inhibits tumor progression. Furthermore, selective delivery to MSLN-positive tumors in combination with gemcitabine-loaded liposomes (D3-LNP-GEM) significantly improved cytotoxicity and promoted tumor regression. These findings highlight the potential of the D3-LNP-GEM platform as a novel targeted therapy for MSLN-expressing malignancies, showing promising efficacy in preclinical models and paving the way for continued clinical evaluation.",AI in Oncology,pancreatic adenocarcinoma paad highly challenging treat due poor prognosis limited effective treatment options liposomal nanotechnology emerged promising drug delivery platform oncology existing liposomal therapies face limitations systemic toxicity insufficient tumor selectivity low target specificity mesothelin msln antigen overexpressed paad attracted attention potential target precision therapy present development antimsln nanobody nb high binding affinity ksubdsub nm selectively bind mslnpositive cancer cells structural analysis revealed hydrophobic hydrogen bonds within complementary determining region cdr nb promote strong binding msln leading significant inhibition aktnfb signaling downregulation fibronectin fn twist key drivers paad oncogenicity vivo studies confirmed nb alone inhibits tumor progression furthermore selective delivery mslnpositive tumors combination gemcitabineloaded liposomes dlnpgem significantly improved cytotoxicity promoted tumor regression findings highlight potential dlnpgem platform novel targeted therapy mslnexpressing malignancies showing promising efficacy preclinical models paving way continued clinical evaluation,AI in Oncology
"Despite the development of mutant-selective KRAS inhibitors, colorectal cancer (CRC) responses remain limited, with stable disease and rapid recurrence being common outcomes. The molecular mechanisms enabling CRC cells to tolerate KRAS inhibition and ultimately develop resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated early transcriptional and proteomic responses to KRAS silencing in 3D CRC cell line spheroid models, aiming to identify pathways associated with sensitivity or resistance to KRAS blockade. Cell lines were stratified into KRAS silencing-sensitive (HCT116 and SW480) and -resistant (LS174T and SW837) groups based on spheroid growth, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis induction. Transcriptional profiling revealed the unfolded protein response (UPR) and WNT/β-catenin signaling as pathways specifically upregulated in KRAS silencing-sensitive cells and downregulated in resistant cells. Proteomic analysis of membrane-enriched fractions further supported UPR deregulation, showing a pronounced downregulation of translation-related proteins in sensitive cells. Functional assays validated that the sensitive cell line HCT116 exhibits reduced protein aggregation and lower translational capacity upon KRAS knockdown, consistent with UPR activation. Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α-mediated UPR signaling did not revert KRAS silencing-induced cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in this cell line. Collectively, our results highlight the UPR activation as an early adaptive response of KRAS-dependent CRC cells to KRAS silencing.",AI in Oncology,despite development mutantselective kras inhibitors colorectal cancer crc responses remain limited stable disease rapid recurrence common outcomes molecular mechanisms enabling crc cells tolerate kras inhibition ultimately develop resistance remain poorly understood investigated early transcriptional proteomic responses kras silencing crc cell line spheroid models aiming identify pathways associated sensitivity resistance kras blockade cell lines stratified kras silencingsensitive hct sw resistant lst sw groups based spheroid growth cell cycle progression apoptosis induction transcriptional profiling revealed unfolded protein response upr wntcatenin signaling pathways specifically upregulated kras silencingsensitive cells downregulated resistant cells proteomic analysis membraneenriched fractions supported upr deregulation showing pronounced downregulation translationrelated proteins sensitive cells functional assays validated sensitive cell line hct exhibits reduced protein aggregation lower translational capacity upon kras knockdown consistent upr activation pharmacological inhibition iremediated upr signaling revert kras silencinginduced cell cycle arrest apoptosis cell line collectively results highlight upr activation early adaptive response krasdependent crc cells kras silencing,AI in Oncology
"The ability of cancer cells to evade immune destruction is governed by various intrinsic factors including their metabolic state. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a pyrimidine synthesis enzyme, increases cancer cell sensitivity to T cell cytotoxicity through induction of ferroptosis. Lipidomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that DHODH inhibition reduces CDP-choline level and attenuates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) via the CDP-choline-dependent Kennedy pathway. To compensate this loss, there is increased synthesis from phosphatidylethanolamine via the phospholipid methylation pathway resulting in increased generation of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PCs. Importantly, inactivation of Dhodh in cancer cells promotes the infiltration of interferon γ-secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhances the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 blockade in female mouse models. Our findings reveal the importance of DHODH in regulating immune evasion through a CDP-choline dependent mechanism and implicate DHODH as a promising target to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.",AI in Oncology,ability cancer cells evade immune destruction governed various intrinsic factors including metabolic state demonstrate inactivation dihydroorotate dehydrogenase dhodh pyrimidine synthesis enzyme increases cancer cell sensitivity cell cytotoxicity induction ferroptosis lipidomic metabolomic analyses reveal dhodh inhibition reduces cdpcholine level attenuates synthesis phosphatidylcholine pc via cdpcholinedependent kennedy pathway compensate loss increased synthesis phosphatidylethanolamine via phospholipid methylation pathway resulting increased generation long chain polyunsaturated fatty acidcontaining pcs importantly inactivation dhodh cancer cells promotes infiltration interferon secreting cdsupsup cells enhances antitumor activity pd blockade female mouse models findings reveal importance dhodh regulating immune evasion cdpcholine dependent mechanism implicate dhodh promising target improve efficacy cancer immunotherapies,AI in Oncology
"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, including BRCA1/2 mutation. However, PARP inhibitors remain a therapeutic challenge in breast and ovarian cancer due to inevitably acquired resistance in most cases. Therefore, strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance are unmet clinical need. SRY-box transcription factor 5 (SOX5) plays a crucial role in development of various cancers but the role of SOX5 in PARP inhibitor resistance is poorly understood. This study identified SOX5 as a potential biomarker associated with PARP inhibitor resistance and addressed potential treatment strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance using the olaparib-resistant preclinical model. We observed that SOX5 was significantly upregulated in olaparib-resistant cells and contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by upregulating DNA repair pathway genes. Ectopic SOX5 overexpression contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by suppressing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancer. SOX5 small interfering RNA combined with olaparib sensitized olaparib-resistant cells and suppressed the growth of olaparib-resistant xenografts in mice via increased DSBs represented by ɣH2AX formation. Mechanistically, SOX5 directly interacted with yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and promoted its nuclear translocation by suppressing the Hippo pathway. YAP1, in association with TEA domain family members (TEAD), upregulated HR-related gene expression and conferred PARP inhibitor resistance. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of SOX5 as a therapeutic target was supported by a significant association between SOX5 overexpression and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer on public mRNA microarray data sets. Therefore, we propose SOX5 as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1/2-mutated breast and ovarian cancer.",AI in Oncology,poly adpribose polymerase parp inhibitors effective cells homologous recombination hr deficiency including brca mutation however parp inhibitors remain therapeutic challenge breast ovarian cancer due inevitably acquired resistance cases therefore strategies overcome parp inhibitor resistance unmet clinical need srybox transcription factor sox plays crucial role development various cancers role sox parp inhibitor resistance poorly understood study identified sox potential biomarker associated parp inhibitor resistance addressed potential treatment strategies overcome parp inhibitor resistance using olaparibresistant preclinical model observed sox significantly upregulated olaparibresistant cells contributed parp inhibitor resistance upregulating dna repair pathway genes ectopic sox overexpression contributed parp inhibitor resistance suppressing dna doublestrand breaks dsbs brcamutated breast ovarian cancer sox small interfering rna combined olaparib sensitized olaparibresistant cells suppressed growth olaparibresistant xenografts mice via increased dsbs represented hax formation mechanistically sox directly interacted yesassociated protein yap promoted nuclear translocation suppressing hippo pathway yap association tea domain family members tead upregulated hrrelated gene expression conferred parp inhibitor resistance furthermore clinical relevance sox therapeutic target supported significant association sox overexpression poor prognosis ovarian cancer public mrna microarray data sets therefore propose sox promising therapeutic target overcoming parp inhibitor resistance brcamutated breast ovarian cancer,AI in Oncology

We additionally examined the immune characteristics of the MSS CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, and an MSS CRC immune cell-related signature (MCICRS) that can be used to predict the clinical outcomes of MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy was developed and validated in our in-house cohort. Compared with VEGFRi alone, the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and VEGFRi exhibited a prolonged survival benefit (median progression-free survival: 4.4 vs. 2.0 months, <i>P</i>=0.0024; median overall survival: 10.2 vs. 5.2 months, <i>P</i>=0.0038) and a similar adverse event incidence. Through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis, we determined ten MSS CRC-enriched immune cell types and their spatial distribution, including naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T, regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17, exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T, cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T, proliferated CD8<sup>+</sup> T, natural killer (NK) cells, plasma, and classical and intermediate monocytes. Based on a systemic meta-analysis and ten machine learning algorithms, we obtained MCICRS, an independent risk factor for the prognosis of MSS CRC patients. Further analyses demonstrated that the low-MCICRS group presented a higher immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathway activation, and hence a significant relation with the superior efficacy of pan-cancer immunotherapy. More importantly, the predictive value of MCICRS in MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy was also validated with an in-house cohort. Anti-PD-1 antibody combined with VEGFRi presented an improved clinical benefit in MSS CRC with manageable toxicity. MCICRS could serve as a robust and promising tool to predict clinical outcomes for individual MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy.",AI in Oncology,recent data suggest vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor vegfri enhance antitumor activity antiprogrammed cell death antipd antibody colorectal cancer crc microsatellite stability mss however comparison combination standard thirdline vegfri treatment performed reliable biomarkers still lacking retrospectively enrolled mss crc patients receiving antipd antibody plus vegfri combination group ini vegfri alone vegfri group ini efficacy safety evaluated additionally examined immune characteristics mss crc tumor microenvironment tme singlecell spatial transcriptomic data mss crc immune cellrelated signature mcicrs used predict clinical outcomes mss crc patients receiving immunotherapy developed validated inhouse cohort compared vegfri alone combination antipd antibody vegfri exhibited prolonged survival benefit median progressionfree survival vs months ipi median overall survival vs months ipi similar adverse event incidence singlecell spatial transcriptomic analysis determined ten mss crcenriched immune cell types spatial distribution including naive cdsupsup regulatory cdsupsup cdsupsup th exhausted cdsupsup cytotoxic cdsupsup proliferated cdsupsup natural killer nk cells plasma classical intermediate monocytes based systemic metaanalysis ten machine learning algorithms obtained mcicrs independent risk factor prognosis mss crc patients analyses demonstrated lowmcicrs group presented higher immune cell infiltration immunerelated pathway activation hence significant relation superior efficacy pancancer immunotherapy importantly predictive value mcicrs mss crc patients receiving immunotherapy also validated inhouse cohort antipd antibody combined vegfri presented improved clinical benefit mss crc manageable toxicity mcicrs could serve robust promising tool predict clinical outcomes individual mss crc patients receiving immunotherapy,AI in Oncology
"Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is closely associated with trophoblast dysfunction, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we found a significantly decreased level of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in RSA villous tissues compared to normal pregnancies. NNMT knockdown suppressed trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and increased embryo absorption rate in vivo. Upstream of NNMT, FOXA1 was identified as its transcriptional regulator, which was also downregulated in RSA villous tissues. Mechanistically, reduced NNMT led to the accumulation of methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine, thus promoting the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. This epigenetic modification further inhibited the expression of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), along with its binding to CD36 receptor and subsequent activation of ERK1/2 pathway in trophoblast. Together, our study demonstrates the crucial role of NNMT at the maternal-fetal interface, provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of RSA, and lays a basis for developing targeted therapies.",AI in Oncology,recurrent spontaneous abortion rsa closely associated trophoblast dysfunction yet underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood herein found significantly decreased level nicotinamide nmethyltransferase nnmt rsa villous tissues compared normal pregnancies nnmt knockdown suppressed trophoblast proliferation migration invasion vitro increased embryo absorption rate vivo upstream nnmt foxa identified transcriptional regulator also downregulated rsa villous tissues mechanistically reduced nnmt led accumulation methyl donor sadenosyl methionine thus promoting methylation histone h lysine epigenetic modification inhibited expression cartilage oligomeric matrix protein comp along binding cd receptor subsequent activation erk pathway trophoblast together study demonstrates crucial role nnmt maternalfetal interface provides mechanistic insights pathogenesis rsa lays basis developing targeted therapies,AI in Oncology
"Cancer remains the second leading cause of death worldwide, representing a substantial challenge to global health. Although traditional risk prediction models have played a crucial role in epidemiology of several cancer types, they have limitations especially in the ability to process complex and multidimensional data. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches represent a promising solution to overcome this limitation. AI techniques have the potential to identify complex patterns and relationships in data that traditional methods might overlook, making them especially useful for handling large and heterogeneous datasets analysed in cancer research. This review first examines the current state of the art of AI techniques, highlighting their differences and suitability for various data types. Then, offers a comprehensive analysis of the literature, focusing on the application of AI approaches in nineteen cancer types (bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, gynaecological cancers, head and neck cancer, haematological cancers, kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer and overall cancer), evaluating the models, metrics, and exposure variables used. Finally, the review discusses the application of AI in the clinical practice, along with an assessment of its potential limitations and future directions.",AI in Oncology,cancer remains second leading cause death worldwide representing substantial challenge global health although traditional risk prediction models played crucial role epidemiology several cancer types limitations especially ability process complex multidimensional data contrast artificial intelligence ai approaches represent promising solution overcome limitation ai techniques potential identify complex patterns relationships data traditional methods might overlook making especially useful handling large heterogeneous datasets analysed cancer research review first examines current state art ai techniques highlighting differences suitability various data types offers comprehensive analysis literature focusing application ai approaches nineteen cancer types bladder cancer breast cancer cervical cancer colorectal cancer endometrial cancer esophageal cancer gastric cancer gynaecological cancers head neck cancer haematological cancers kidney cancer liver cancer lung cancer melanoma ovarian cancer pancreatic cancer prostate cancer thyroid cancer overall cancer evaluating models metrics exposure variables used finally review discusses application ai clinical practice along assessment potential limitations future directions,AI in Oncology
"The choice of frontline therapy for a patient with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) can have a profound effect on the long-term clinical outcome. Currently, five tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs-imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and asciminib) are available for frontline therapy, but no single TKI is optimal for all patients. EUTOS long-term survival (ELTS) risk score, comorbidities, and treatment-free remission (TFR) priority are the key determinants of frontline TKI selection. Higher ELTS score, low age and comorbidity score, and a high priority for achievement of TFR would all favor the frontline use of a more potent TKI than imatinib. However, no TKI has improved survival compared with imatinib. In children with CP-CML, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib have similar long-term efficacy, with ease of administration and impact of toxicities on quality of life being key considerations. Recent adult trials of reduced-dose dasatinib frontline showed that efficacy may be equivalent to standard-dose dasatinib with a better tolerability and safety profile, but experience is limited in patients with high-risk ELTS scores. The ASC4FIRST trial has confirmed that tolerability and molecular response with asciminib are superior to those with both imatinib and the second-generation (2G)-TKIs. While the overall treatment failure rate was lower with asciminib, the rate of BCR::ABL1 mutations that emerged with asciminib appeared to be higher. The risk of emergent mutations appears to be highly associated with the presence of <i>ASXL1</i> mutations in the CML cells at diagnosis, but more work is needed to understand the implications of this finding.",AI in Oncology,choice frontline therapy patient chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia cpcml profound effect longterm clinical outcome currently five tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkisimatinib dasatinib nilotinib bosutinib asciminib available frontline therapy single tki optimal patients eutos longterm survival elts risk score comorbidities treatmentfree remission tfr priority key determinants frontline tki selection higher elts score low age comorbidity score high priority achievement tfr would favor frontline use potent tki imatinib however tki improved survival compared imatinib children cpcml imatinib dasatinib nilotinib similar longterm efficacy ease administration impact toxicities quality life key considerations recent adult trials reduceddose dasatinib frontline showed efficacy may equivalent standarddose dasatinib better tolerability safety profile experience limited patients highrisk elts scores ascfirst trial confirmed tolerability molecular response asciminib superior imatinib secondgeneration gtkis overall treatment failure rate lower asciminib rate bcrabl mutations emerged asciminib appeared higher risk emergent mutations appears highly associated presence iasxli mutations cml cells diagnosis work needed understand implications finding,AI in Oncology
"Patient-centered research is essential for bridging the gap between research and patient care, yet patient perspectives are often inadequately represented in health research. To leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze a large dataset of patient messages, defining patient concerns and generating relevant research topics, and to quantify the quality of these AI-generated topics. This case series was conducted using an automated framework involving a 2-staged unsupervised NLP topic model and AI-generated research topic suggestions. The study was based on deidentified patient portal message data from individuals with breast or skin cancer at Stanford Health Care and 22 affiliated centers over July 2013 to April 2024. A widely used large language model (ChatGPT-4o [OpenAI]; April 2024) was used and guided through multiple prompt-engineering strategies to perform multilevel tasks, including knowledge interpretation and summarization (eg, interpreting and summarizing the NLP-defined topics), knowledge generation (eg, generating research ideas corresponding to patients' issues), self-reflection and correction (eg, ensuring and revising the research ideas after searching for scientific articles), and self-reassurance (eg, confirming and finalizing the research ideas). Three breast oncologists (J.L.C., A.W.K., F.R) and 3 dermatologists (K.Y.S, J.Y.T., E.L.) evaluated the meaningfulness and novelty of the AI-generated research topics using a 5-point Likert scale (1 representing exceptional to 5 representing poor). Mean (SD) scores for meaningfulness and novelty were computed for each topic. A total of 614 464 patient messages were analyzed from 25 549 individuals, 10 665 with breast cancer (98.6% female) and 14 884 had skin cancer (49.0% female). The overall mean (SD) scores for meaningfulness and novelty were 3.00 (0.50) and 3.29 (0.74), respectively, for breast cancer topics and 2.67 (0.45) and 3.09 (0.68), respectively, for skin cancer topics. One-third of the AI-suggested research topics were highly meaningful and novel when both scores were lower than the average (5 of 15 for breast cancer and 6 of 15 for skin cancer). Notably, two-thirds of the AI-suggested topics were novel (10 of 15 for breast cancer and 11 of 15 for skin cancer). This case series demonstrates that AI/NLP-driven analysis of large volumes of patient messages can generate quality research topics in cancer care that reflect patient perspectives, providing valuable guidance for future patient-centered health research endeavors.",AI in Oncology,patientcentered research essential bridging gap research patient care yet patient perspectives often inadequately represented health research leverage artificial intelligence ai natural language processing nlp analyze large dataset patient messages defining patient concerns generating relevant research topics quantify quality aigenerated topics case series conducted using automated framework involving staged unsupervised nlp topic model aigenerated research topic suggestions study based deidentified patient portal message data individuals breast skin cancer stanford health care affiliated centers july april widely used large language model chatgpto openai april used guided multiple promptengineering strategies perform multilevel tasks including knowledge interpretation summarization eg interpreting summarizing nlpdefined topics knowledge generation eg generating research ideas corresponding patients issues selfreflection correction eg ensuring revising research ideas searching scientific articles selfreassurance eg confirming finalizing research ideas three breast oncologists jlc awk fr dermatologists kys jyt el evaluated meaningfulness novelty aigenerated research topics using point likert scale representing exceptional representing poor mean sd scores meaningfulness novelty computed topic total patient messages analyzed individuals breast cancer female skin cancer female overall mean sd scores meaningfulness novelty respectively breast cancer topics respectively skin cancer topics onethird aisuggested research topics highly meaningful novel scores lower average breast cancer skin cancer notably twothirds aisuggested topics novel breast cancer skin cancer case series demonstrates ainlpdriven analysis large volumes patient messages generate quality research topics cancer care reflect patient perspectives providing valuable guidance future patientcentered health research endeavors,AI in Oncology

"Findings from early phase studies are not always placed in the public domain. This study aims to explore why many early phase clinical oncology studies are not published, as well as identify the potential barriers investigators encountered in the publication process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among investigators with experience in early phase clinical oncology studies. Interviews were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Twenty-one investigators were interviewed. The majority worked in Europe (n = 13), while other investigators were based in North America (n = 4), Asia (n = 2) or Oceania (n = 2). We identified three reasons why investigators believed publishing early phase clinical trial results was important: (1) there is an ethical and moral responsibility; (2) there should be no loss of knowledge to society; and (3) there should be no waste of resources. Four main barriers in the publication process of early phase clinical trials were identified: (1) practical barriers (eg, an increased complexity of number of trials/trial sites), (2) insufficient resources (eg, money, time and human), (3) limited motivation (eg, limited intrinsic motivation of the investigator or limited prospect of return for the sponsor), and (4) inadequate collaboration (eg, different interests between industry partners and investigators). Finally, five major stakeholders were identified that can potentially contribute to improving the publication process: (1) journal editors, (2) sponsors, (3) investigators, (4) regulatory bodies, and (5) society. Investigator suggestions for improving this process, for each stakeholder, are presented. This study highlights the barriers experienced in publishing early phase clinical trials.

"We present a prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous arginine in patients 3-21 years hospitalized with sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive pain episodes (SCD-VOE) at two tertiary-care children's hospitals. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 arms: Standard-dose (SD; 100 mg/kg/dose) every 8 h, Loading-dose (200 mg/kg followed by SD), or Placebo. The primary outcome was total parenteral opioid use (TPO). Secondary outcomes included time-to-crisis-resolution, pain scores, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), arginine bioavailability, and biomarkers of oxidative stress/mitochondrial function. Of 1548 patients screened, 108 were randomized (36 per study-arm; mean 12.6 ± 3.8 years, 52% female, and 65% hemoglobin-SS). This study did not meet its primary endpoint. TPO, time-to-crisis-resolution, pain scores, and PROs at discharge were similar across arms. Post hoc sensitivity analyses of children 5-16 years old demonstrated nearly double TPO utilization in those receiving placebo versus arginine (n = 87, p = 0.056), achieving significance in patients with plasma arginine < 60 μM. Arginine was low at presentation in 79% of patients (mean 50 ± 28 μM), and increased with arginine therapy (p < 0.001). Arginine bioavailability at VOE presentation inversely correlated with time-to-crisis-resolution (r = -0.39, p = 0.01) after placebo, an association eliminated by arginine supplementation (r = -0.04, p = 0.70). A dose-dependent increase in platelet-mitochondrial activity occurred after arginine versus no change after placebo (p < 0.001); plasma protein-carbonyl levels, a measure of oxidative stress, decreased after arginine therapy (p < 0.001) but increased in the placebo group (p = 0.02). SCD-VOE is associated with an acquired arginine deficiency that correlates with worse clinical outcomes. Arginine improved mitochondrial function and decreased oxidative stress compared to placebo, with clinically relevant opioid-sparing becoming significant in children with the lowest arginine concentration.

"Drug resistance is one of the main reasons for cancer treatment failure, leading to a rapid recurrence/disease progression of the cancer. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered physicians to use its powerful data processing and pattern recognition capabilities to extract and mine valuable drug resistance information from large amounts of clinical or omics data, to study drug resistance mechanisms, to evaluate and predict drug resistance, and to develop innovative therapeutic strategies to reduce drug resistance. In this review, we proposed a feasible workflow for incorporating AI into tumor drug resistance research, highlighted current AI-driven tumor drug resistance applications, and discussed the opportunities and challenges encountered in the process. Based on a comprehensive literature analysis, we systematically summarized the role of AI in tumor drug resistance research, including drug development, resistance mechanism elucidation, drug sensitivity prediction, combination therapy optimization, resistance phenotype identification, and clinical biomarker discovery. With the continuous advancement of AI technology and rigorous validation of clinical data, AI models are expected to fuel the development of precision oncology by improving efficacy, guiding therapeutic decisions, and optimizing patient prognosis.

"The main objective of this multi-institutional study is to understand the effect of primary intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement on clinical outcomes in recipients of BCMA-directed bispecific antibody (bsAb), where infection remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. This is a retrospective study of patients treated with either standard of care teclistamab or BCMA-directed investigational bsAb between Nov 2017 and Dec 2023. Primary IVIG prophylaxis was defined as starting IVIG prior to first documented infection. All analyses were adjusted for immortal-time bias inherent in this grouping. A total of 225 patients were included in this analysis. Primary IVIG prophylaxis was defined as starting IVIG prior to first documented infection. The median follow-up of patients treated with and without primary IVIG prophylaxis was, 9 and 11 months, respectively. The cumulative incidence of all grade infections at 12 months with and without primary IVIG prophylaxis were 56% (95%CI 40%,78%) and 60% (95% CI 48%, 76%); p = 0.72, respectively.

"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV16, is closely correlated with certain cancers. E6 and E7 proteins of HPV16 play critical roles in oncogenesis, making them optimal targets for treating HPV-associated cancers. Here, we engineered an innovative vaccine, Ad-E6/7-HR, designed to evoke immune responses through the incorporation of self-assembling heptad-repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 originated from Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Ad-E6/7-HR was constructed utilising a replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5 vector and evaluated its immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy in murine models. We verified the antitumour efficacy of the vaccine in TC-1 subcutaneous and pulmonary models. Flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess the cellular immunogenicity of Ad-E6/7-HR. Ad-E6/7-HR induced robust immune responses, significantly increasing antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The vaccine also enhanced memory T-cell generation and induced potent cytokine secretion, as exemplified by interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor-α. Ad-E6/7-HR conferred complete protection against tumour growth in the prophylactic model. In therapeutic settings, Ad-E6/7-HR significantly reduced tumour size and improved survival. Furthermore, Ad-E6/7-HR reshaped the tumour microenvironment by increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell recruitment and reduced immunosuppressive cells, like myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2 macrophages, thereby enhancing antitumour immunity. By targeting HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins and leveraging the self-assembling HR1 and HR2 sequences to enhance immune responses, Ad-E6/7-HR represented a promising candidate for preventing and treating HPV-associated cancers.

"- Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of dementia by 1.5 to 2.5 times. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin, widely used antidiabetic therapies, have demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects. Their comparative effectiveness in dementia prevention remains unknown. - This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX global federated network, analyzing de-identified records from over 98 healthcare organizations. Adults with T2D initiating SGLT2i or metformin as first-line therapy were propensity score-matched (1:1). The primary outcome was overall dementia incidence, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other subtypes. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Time-to-event outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. - Among 74,975 matched patients in each cohort, SGLT2i use was associated with a lower incidence of overall dementia: 2.7% vs. 6.9%: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.80 [95% CI 0.76;0.84]. Reductions were observed in vascular dementia (0.8% vs. 2.0%; aHR 0.87), Alzheimer's dementia (1.1% vs. 3.2%; aHR, 0.76), and all-cause mortality (6.8% vs. 15.4%; aHR, 0.92). Benefits were pronounced in older adults, particularly those aged ≥80 years. - SGLT2is significantly reduced dementia risk and mortality compared to metformin in T2D patients. These findings suggest SGLT2is may offer superior neuroprotective benefits, underscoring their potential as a first-line therapy for T2D.

"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related condition associated with increased mortality among patients with cancer. CHIP mutations with high variant-allele frequencies can be detected in tumors, a phenomenon we term tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH). The frequency of TI-CH and its effect on tumor evolution are unclear. We characterized CHIP and TI-CH in 421 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the TRACERx study and in 49,351 patients from the MSK-IMPACT pan-cancer cohort. We studied the association of TI-CH with survival and disease recurrence and evaluated the functional effect of <i>TET2</i>-mutant CHIP on the biologic features of lung tumors. Among patients with NSCLC, 42% of those with CHIP had TI-CH. TI-CH independently predicted an increased risk of death or recurrence, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 2.63) as compared with the absence of CHIP and an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.56) as compared with CHIP in the absence of TI-CH. Among patients with solid tumors, 26% of those with CHIP had TI-CH. TI-CH conferred a risk of death from any cause that was 1.17 times (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.29) as high as the risk with CHIP in the absence of TI-CH. <i>TET2</i> mutations were the strongest genetic predictor of TI-CH; such mutations enhanced monocyte migration to lung tumor cells, fueled a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment in mice, and resulted in the promotion of tumor organoid growth. TI-CH increased the risk of disease recurrence or death among patients with NSCLC and the risk of death from any cause among patients with solid tumors. TI-CH remodeled the tumor immune microenvironment and accelerated tumor organoid growth, findings that support a role for an aging-related hematologic clonal proliferation in cancer evolution.

"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a common endocrine malignancy with a generally favorable prognosis, but lymph node metastasis (LNM) complicates treatment and increases recurrence risk. Current preoperative methods like neck ultrasound often miss LNM, leading to unnecessary surgeries. This study developed a non-invasive, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive model for LNM using gene expression data from 157 PTC patients and validated it with qRT-PCR across 807 participants from multiple centers. The model focused on three key genes - RPS4Y1, PKHD1L1, and CRABP1 - chosen for their predictive strength. A random forest algorithm achieved high accuracy, with an AUROC of 0.992 in training and 0.911-0.953 in external validation. RPS4Y1 emerged as a standout predictor, showing the strongest distinction between metastatic and non-metastatic cases. The study also identified immune-related pathways, such as TGF-β signaling and cancer-associated fibroblast activation, as critical in metastasis. This gene expression-based model offers a non-invasive, cost-effective solution for predicting LNM, providing valuable insights to guide surgical decisions and reduce unnecessary procedures, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",AI in Oncology,papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc common endocrine malignancy generally favorable prognosis lymph node metastasis lnm complicates treatment increases recurrence risk current preoperative methods like neck ultrasound often miss lnm leading unnecessary surgeries study developed noninvasive artificial intelligence aidriven predictive model lnm using gene expression data ptc patients validated qrtpcr across participants multiple centers model focused three key genes rpsy pkhdl crabp chosen predictive strength random forest algorithm achieved high accuracy auroc training external validation rpsy emerged standout predictor showing strongest distinction metastatic nonmetastatic cases study also identified immunerelated pathways tgf signaling cancerassociated fibroblast activation critical metastasis gene expressionbased model offers noninvasive costeffective solution predicting lnm providing valuable insights guide surgical decisions reduce unnecessary procedures ultimately improving patient outcomes,AI in Oncology

"Uterine broad ligament fibroids present unique surgical challenges due to their proximity to vital pelvic structures. This study aimed to evaluate artificial intelligence (AI)-guided MRI instance segmentation for optimizing laparoscopic myomectomy outcomes. In this trial, 120 patients with MRI-confirmed broad ligament fibroids were allocated to either AI-assisted group (n=60) or conventional MRI group (n=60). A deep learning model was developed to segment fibroids, uterine walls, and uterine cavity from preoperative MRI. Compared to conventional MRI guidance, AI assistance significantly reduced operative time (118 [112.25-125.00] vs. 140 [115.75-160.75] minutes; p<0.001). The AI group also demonstrated lower intraoperative blood loss (50 [50-100] vs. 85 [50-100] ml; p=0.01) and faster postoperative recovery (first flatus within 24 hours: (15[25.00%] vs. 29[48.33%], p=0.01).

"BRAF activating mutations occur in approximately 10% of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRCs) and are associated with worse prognosis in part due to an inferior response to standard chemotherapy. Standard of care for patients with refractory metastatic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC is treatment with BRAF and EGFR inhibitors and recent FDA approval was given to use these inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy for patients with treatment naïve metastatic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC. Lineage plasticity to neuroendocrine cancer is an emerging mechanism of targeted therapy resistance in several cancer types. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs), the neuroendocrine cell of the intestine, are uniquely present in BRAF mutant CRC as compared to BRAF wildtype CRC. BRAF plus EGFR inhibitor treatment induced changes in cell composition were determined by gene expression, imaging and single cell approaches in multiple models of BRAF mutant CRC. Furthermore, multiple clinically relevant inhibitors of the lysine demethylase LSD1 were tested to determine which inhibitor blocked the changes in cell composition. Combined BRAF and EGFR inhibition enriched for EECs in all BRAF mutant CRC models tested. Additionally, EECs and other secretory cell types were enriched in a subset of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC patient samples following targeted therapy. Importantly, inhibition of LSD1 with a clinically relevant inhibitor attenuated targeted therapy-induced EEC enrichment through blocking the interaction of LSD1, CoREST2 and STAT3. Our findings that BRAF plus EGFR inhibition induces lineage plasticity in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> CRC represents a new paradigm for how resistance to BRAF plus EGFR inhibition occurs.

"The response rate of antibody therapy targeting immune checkpoint molecules in ovarian cancer is insufficient. This study aimed to develop a novel gene immunotherapy model targeting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in vivo in ovarian cancer using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 and investigate its efficacy. In vitro, we produced PD-L1-AAV particles to knock out PD-L1. PD-L1-AAV particles were transduced into the murine ovarian cancer cell line ID8. PD-L1 expression at the cellular level was significantly decreased following treatment with PD-L1-AAV particles compared with control-AAV particles. In the peritoneal dissemination model, the survival time was significantly longer in the PD-L1-AAV particles intraperitoneally injected group than that in the control group. Furthermore, intratumoral lymphocyte recruitment was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the number of intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly higher, whereas that of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells was significantly lower in the PD-L1-AAV particles injected group than in the control group.

"Microbiome research has revealed associations between microbial species and colorectal cancer (CRC). Most of the existing research relied on metagenomic data. We leveraged a tool that we recently developed for detecting human and microbial peptides from (meta)proteomics data to reanalyze Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium CRC proteomics datasets. Our analyses revealed potential microbial species and proteins that are associated with CRC, especially when analyzing multiplexed proteomics data consisting of cancerous and healthy tissue taken from the same individuals. Many of the identified proteins are associated with species with known links to CRC, such as the fungi Aspergillus kawachii, but many are unstudied or their specific roles unknown. Proteins from other microbial species, such as Paenibacillus cellulosilyticus, were also identified in the samples. We showed that Aspergillus kawachii and others are depleted overall in cancer samples, which is consistent with a previous genomic-based multi-cohort study. Our analysis also revealed that some proteins belonging to this species are more abundantly detected, while others in this and other species are not. Further, we showed that microbial identifications could be used to build predictive models for tumor detection, but caution needs to be taken when applying such models trained on one dataset to another due to the substantial impacts of different experimental techniques on peptide detection profiles.",AI in Oncology,microbiome research revealed associations microbial species colorectal cancer crc existing research relied metagenomic data leveraged tool recently developed detecting human microbial peptides metaproteomics data reanalyze clinical proteomic tumor analysis consortium crc proteomics datasets analyses revealed potential microbial species proteins associated crc especially analyzing multiplexed proteomics data consisting cancerous healthy tissue taken individuals many identified proteins associated species known links crc fungi aspergillus kawachii many unstudied specific roles unknown proteins microbial species paenibacillus cellulosilyticus also identified samples showed aspergillus kawachii others depleted overall cancer samples consistent previous genomicbased multicohort study analysis also revealed proteins belonging species abundantly detected others species showed microbial identifications could used build predictive models tumor detection caution needs taken applying models trained one dataset another due substantial impacts different experimental techniques peptide detection profiles,AI in Oncology
"FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) is a common driver mutation that presents with a high leukemic burden and its impact on metabolic homeostasis remains to be further investigated. Here, we revealed that the oncogenic activation of FLT3/ITD induced upregulation of target genes of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in vivo and in acute myeloid leukemia patients. Quizartinib is a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor that selectively inhibits the activating FLT3 mutations. We demonstrated the critical role of SREBP1 degradation in conferring the response of FLT3/ITD cells to quizartinib. Mechanistically, quizartinib facilitated degradation of the precursor form of SREBP1 via the FLT3/AKT/GSK3 axis and reduced protein levels of its target gene fatty acid synthase (FASN). Lipidomics analysis by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) demonstrated that inhibition of FLT3 altered global levels of phospholipids including reduction of cardiolipin, leading to subsequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Pharmacological inhibition of SREBP1 or FASN sensitized FLT3/ITD leukemia cells to quizartinib. Quizartinib combined with SREBP inhibitor fatostatin or FASN inhibitor orlistat provided substantial therapeutic benefit over monotherapies in the murine FLT3/ITD leukemia model.

"The complete closure of mucosal defects following colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is often challenging. We invented a traction-band-assisted endoscopic closure (TBEC) technique using clips with an integrated traction band. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of TBEC for closing mucosal defects following colorectal ESD. This multicenter, prospective, single-arm, pilot study was conducted at three institutions from June 2022 to March 2023. Thirty-four patients with colorectal neoplasms measuring 20-50 mm scheduled for ESD were enrolled. TBEC was performed at each mucosal defect after ESD. The primary outcome was the complete closure rate by TBEC. Secondary outcomes included the number of clips used, procedure time, and adverse events (AEs). TBEC yielded a 100.0% [95% confidence interval: 89.8%-100.0%] complete closure rate, with a median closure time of 14.5 min (interquartile range: 12.9). The median number of clips used was 10.0 (3.3). One case of delayed bleeding and one of post-ESD coagulation syndrome (both 2.9% [0.5%-14.9%]) occurred following TBEC. This study demonstrated the feasibility of TBEC for closing mucosal defects following colorectal ESD. TBEC is a simple and easily applicable technique for endoscopic closure.

"Immune checkpoint inhibition and targeted therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibition for BRAF-mutated melanoma have significantly improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. Current research focuses on novel treatment strategies for PD-1 resistance, neoadjuvant approaches, and cellular therapies. 10-year follow-up data of randomized clinical trials show that both combined CTLA-4 and PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition and PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition alone can achieve long-term survival in metastatic melanoma. Potential surrogate markers of long-term response include a progression-free survival at 3 years after start of treatment and a reduction in tumour burden of at least 80%. The management of PD-1 resistance remains a challenge. Advances in molecular pathology have led to the identification of new therapeutic targets. Several cellular therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as alternatives for melanoma patients refractory to immune checkpoint inhibition or targeted BRAF/MEK inhibition. In BRAF-mutant melanoma, combined BRAF/MEK inhibition is an alternative to immune checkpoint inhibition. Real-world data and clinical trial results on treatment sequencing suggest that immune checkpoint inhibition may improve survival in the first line setting, particularly in the absence of prior adjuvant systemic therapy. Adjuvant treatment leads to improved progression-free survival in melanoma patients while overall survival data are still pending.

"Melanoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide with a high mortality rate. However, the smaller the melanoma is when it is first diagnosed, the better the prognosis. Since skin melanomas can be detected relatively easy with the naked eye, systematic skin cancer screening could theoretically reduce melanoma mortality by diagnosing it as early as possible. Evaluations of skin cancer early detection programs show an increase in the incidence of detection of the skin cancer and especially thins melanomas, but so far, no evidence of a decrease in mortality. Current data on patient-related factors show that fewer men and people with lower socioeconomic status participate in skin cancer screening and knowledge about skin cancer-associated factors is low.Based on the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to recommend or advise against skin cancer screening for the asymptomatic population. Screening is recommended for all people at increased risk: fair skin type according to Fitzpatrick I-II, under immunosuppression, more than 50 melanocytic nevi and history of dysplastic and/or large nevi, family history of melanoma, frequent severe sunburns in childhood. In addition, targeted educational campaigns among risk groups (men, people with low levels of education) are needed.New imaging techniques such as 3D whole-body photography with additional computer-based, AI-assisted risk assessment of digital dermoscopic images, when integrated into clinical decision-making processes (as ""augmented intelligence"" - AI), clearly have the potential to improve skin cancer screening, particularly in high-risk and melanoma patients. In combination with human expertise, they can potentially offer a more effective and comprehensive approach to detecting and monitoring skin cancer. Randomized controlled studies must show to what extent this promising technique has proven itself in the clinic and is also suitable for other populations.",AI in Oncology,melanoma one common cancers worldwide high mortality rate however smaller melanoma first diagnosed better prognosis since skin melanomas detected relatively easy naked eye systematic skin cancer screening could theoretically reduce melanoma mortality diagnosing early possible evaluations skin cancer early detection programs show increase incidence detection skin cancer especially thins melanomas far evidence decrease mortality current data patientrelated factors show fewer men people lower socioeconomic status participate skin cancer screening knowledge skin cancerassociated factors lowbased current study situation therefore possible recommend advise skin cancer screening asymptomatic population screening recommended people increased risk fair skin type according fitzpatrick iii immunosuppression melanocytic nevi history dysplastic andor large nevi family history melanoma frequent severe sunburns childhood addition targeted educational campaigns among risk groups men people low levels education needednew imaging techniques wholebody photography additional computerbased aiassisted risk assessment digital dermoscopic images integrated clinical decisionmaking processes augmented intelligence ai clearly potential improve skin cancer screening particularly highrisk melanoma patients combination human expertise potentially offer effective comprehensive approach detecting monitoring skin cancer randomized controlled studies must show extent promising technique proven clinic also suitable populations,AI in Oncology
"To assess the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the diagnostic performance of radiologists with varying experience levels in mammography reading, considering single and simulated double reading approaches. In this retrospective study, 150 mammography examinations (30 with pathology-confirmed malignancies, 120 without malignancies [confirmed by 2-year follow-up]) were reviewed according to five approaches: A) human single reading by 26 radiologists of varying experience; B) AI single reading (Lunit INSIGHT MMG; C) human single reading with simultaneous AI support; D) simulated human-human double reading; E) simulated human-AI double reading, with AI as second independent reader flagging cases with a cancer probability ≥10 %. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared using McNemar's test, univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Compared to single reading without AI support, single reading with simultaneous AI support improved mean sensitivity from 69.2 % (standard deviation [SD] 15.6) to 84.5 % (SD 8.1, p < 0.001), providing comparable mean specificity (91.8 % versus 90.8 %, p = 0.06). The sensitivity increase provided by the AI-supported single reading was largest in the group of radiologists with a sensitivity below the median in the non-supported single reading, from 56.7 % (SD 12.1) to 79.7 % (SD 10.2, p < 0.001). In the simulated human-AI double reading approach, sensitivity further increased to 91.8 % (SD 3.4), surpassing that of the human-human simulated double reading (87.4 %, SD 8.8, p = 0.016), with comparable mean specificity (from 84.0 % to 83.0 %, p = 0.17).

"Artificial intelligence (AI) could improve accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening. However, many women distrust AI in health care, potentially jeopardizing breast cancer screening participation rates. The aim was to quantify community preferences for models of AI implementation within breast cancer screening. An online discrete choice experiment survey of people eligible for breast cancer screening aged 40 to 74 years in Australia. Respondents answered 10 questions where they chose between two screening options created by an experimental design. Each screening option described the role of AI (supplementing current practice, replacing one radiologist, replacing both radiologists, or triaging), and the AI accuracy, ownership, representativeness, privacy, and waiting time. Analysis included conditional and latent class models, willingness-to-pay, and predicted screening uptake. The 802 participants preferred screening where AI was more accurate, Australian owned, more representative and had shorter waiting time for results (all p < .001). There were strong preferences (p < .001) against AI alone or as triage. Three patterns of preferences emerged: positive about AI if accuracy improves (40% of sample), strongly against AI (42%), and concerned about AI (18%). Participants were willing to accept AI replacing one human reader if their results were available 10 days faster than current practice but would need results 21 days faster for AI as triage. Implementing AI inconsistent with community preferences could reduce participation by up to 22%.",AI in Oncology,artificial intelligence ai could improve accuracy efficiency breast cancer screening however many women distrust ai health care potentially jeopardizing breast cancer screening participation rates aim quantify community preferences models ai implementation within breast cancer screening online discrete choice experiment survey people eligible breast cancer screening aged years australia respondents answered questions chose two screening options created experimental design screening option described role ai supplementing current practice replacing one radiologist replacing radiologists triaging ai accuracy ownership representativeness privacy waiting time analysis included conditional latent class models willingnesstopay predicted screening uptake participants preferred screening ai accurate australian owned representative shorter waiting time results p strong preferences p ai alone triage three patterns preferences emerged positive ai accuracy improves sample strongly ai concerned ai participants willing accept ai replacing one human reader results available days faster current practice would need results days faster ai triage implementing ai inconsistent community preferences could reduce participation,AI in Oncology
"TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domain), Vstm3, and VSIG9, are newly recognized immunological checkpoints. They are prominently expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), natural killer (NK) cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The TIGIT (TIGIT) protein is crucial for immune modulation since it diminishes NK cell populations and hinders T cell activity in cancer patients and experimental models. CD155, the principal ligand of TIGIT in humans, has been recognized as a pivotal target for immunotherapy owing to its interaction with TIGIT. CD155 is linked to the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy, even without TIGIT expression, underscoring its importance in immune checkpoint suppression. Anti-TIGIT medicines, either independently or in conjunction with anti-PD-1 treatments, have demonstrated potential in augmenting immune responses to malignancies. This review examines the structural and functional characteristics of the TIGIT protein, new developments in anti-TIGIT drugs, and their prospective use in cancer immunotherapy.",AI in Oncology,tigit cell immunoreceptor immunoglobulin tyrosinebased inhibitory motif itim domain vstm vsig newly recognized immunological checkpoints prominently expressed cd cd cells tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes tils natural killer nk cells regulatory cells tregs tigit tigit protein crucial immune modulation since diminishes nk cell populations hinders cell activity cancer patients experimental models cd principal ligand tigit humans recognized pivotal target immunotherapy owing interaction tigit cd linked efficacy antiprogrammed cell death protein pd therapy even without tigit expression underscoring importance immune checkpoint suppression antitigit medicines either independently conjunction antipd treatments demonstrated potential augmenting immune responses malignancies review examines structural functional characteristics tigit protein new developments antitigit drugs prospective use cancer immunotherapy,AI in Oncology
"ObjectiveTo evaluate the killing effect of c-Met CAR-T on tumor cells with different degrees of c-Met expression. It was demonstrated that CAR-T autocrine PD-1 antibody could alleviate immune checkpoint inhibition and enhance the anti-tumor effect of T cells.MethodsThe specificity and clinical significance of c-Met and PD-L1 expression in various solid tumors were verified by bioinformatics analysis. c-Met specific CAR-T and c-Met specific CAR-T secreted by PD-L1 were synthesized, and c-Met CAR-T and c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T were prepared by constructing lentivirus. Flow cytometry was used to verify the positive rate and cell population of CAR-T, western blot was used to verify the secretion of PD-1 antibody, and cck-8 was used to detect the proliferation of CAR-T in tumor cells with different c-Met expression. LDH and ELISA further evaluated the antitumor effects of c-Met CAR-T and c-Met/PD-1 CAR-T in vitro.Resultsc-Met and PD-L1 were expressed in pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, bladder cancer, glioma and other tumors, and were associated with a variety of immune cell infiltration. Tumor cells with high expression of c-Met can strongly stimulate the proliferation of c-Met CAR-T, and c-Met CAR-T has strong cell lysis ability on tumor cells with high expression of c-Met. Autocrine PD-1 antibody can significantly improve the activity of c-Met CAR T cells, tumor lysis ability and cytokine secretion level.ConclusionThe antitumor activity of c-Met CAR-T is positively correlated with the expression of c-Met. c-Met CAR-T secreted by PD-1 showed enhanced antitumor function in solid tumor treatment.",AI in Oncology,objectiveto evaluate killing effect cmet cart tumor cells different degrees cmet expression demonstrated cart autocrine pd antibody could alleviate immune checkpoint inhibition enhance antitumor effect cellsmethodsthe specificity clinical significance cmet pdl expression various solid tumors verified bioinformatics analysis cmet specific cart cmet specific cart secreted pdl synthesized cmet cart cmetpd cart prepared constructing lentivirus flow cytometry used verify positive rate cell population cart western blot used verify secretion pd antibody cck used detect proliferation cart tumor cells different cmet expression ldh elisa evaluated antitumor effects cmet cart cmetpd cart vitroresultscmet pdl expressed pancreatic cancer ovarian cancer esophageal cancer bladder cancer glioma tumors associated variety immune cell infiltration tumor cells high expression cmet strongly stimulate proliferation cmet cart cmet cart strong cell lysis ability tumor cells high expression cmet autocrine pd antibody significantly improve activity cmet car cells tumor lysis ability cytokine secretion levelconclusionthe antitumor activity cmet cart positively correlated expression cmet cmet cart secreted pd showed enhanced antitumor function solid tumor treatment,AI in Oncology
"IntroductionAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives (AIANs) experience significant cancer incidence and mortality disparities, with elevated cancer risk factor exposure, lower cancer screening rates, and poorer quality of cancer care relative to non-Hispanic Whites. To address these issues, the Southeastern American Indian Cancer health Equity Partnership (SAICEP) was formed to understand and address cancer disparities among southeastern American Indians (AIs).MethodsSAICEP formed in 2021 through the Community Outreach and Engagement offices of the NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in North Carolina (NC). The catchment areas for these cancer centers include the tribal homelands for eight state and federally recognized Tribes, representing the largest AI populations in the eastern US. SAICEP seeks to: (1) increase awareness of cancer health needs of AI populations; (2) expand access to cancer health education and build community capacity to address cancer health needs; (3) develop collaborative research relationships to better understand and address the AI cancer burden.ResultsFor Aim 1, SAICEP created a virtual speakers' series, featuring prominent AI cancer researchers and clinicians, hosted by the UNC Lineberger Cancer Network three times a year. To date, 10 webinars have been convened, with a total of 538 participants. For Aim 2, SAICEP participates in tribal events throughout the year, reaching over 3500 AIs and disseminating printed cancer educational materials and giveaways. For Aim 3, SAICEP secured funding to conduct analyses to assess cancer incidence, mortality, and care quality for NC AIs, to collect information to understand community cancer needs and culturally adapt and disseminate information on cancer screening and risk reduction.ConclusionThrough its targeted research and engagement, SAICEP has successfully moved towards achieving its goal of understanding and addressing cancer disparities among AIs in NC.

"Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) serve as crucial targets in cancer immunotherapy, and their inhibitors have significantly improved the prognosis of many patients with malignant tumors. However, the issues of drug resistance and limited overall response rate associated with monotherapy remain prevalent. As a new generation of immune checkpoints, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) synergistically enhances the suppression of T cells alongside PD-1 in various cancers. Combining the blockade of both PD-1 and LAG-3 yields stronger anti-tumor immune effects compared to blocking either target alone, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment and reducing the occurrence of resistance. This review covers the structural characteristics of LAG-3 and unveils its specific interactions with PD-1 across multiple cancers, providing a novel reference for overcoming the limitations of single-agent therapy.",AI in Oncology,programmed death pd ligand pdl serve crucial targets cancer immunotherapy inhibitors significantly improved prognosis many patients malignant tumors however issues drug resistance limited overall response rate associated monotherapy remain prevalent new generation immune checkpoints lymphocyte activation gene lag synergistically enhances suppression cells alongside pd various cancers combining blockade pd lag yields stronger antitumor immune effects compared blocking either target alone thereby reversing immunosuppressive state tumor microenvironment reducing occurrence resistance review covers structural characteristics lag unveils specific interactions pd across multiple cancers providing novel reference overcoming limitations singleagent therapy,AI in Oncology

"Genetic alteration of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase frequently occurs in glioblastoma (GBM). Clinically, bevacizumab treatment results in MET signaling activation, leading to GBM recurrence with a more malignant phenotype. While MET has been a promising therapeutic target, MET inhibitors have not been successful in treating GBM patients. MET-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells hold the promise of targeting MET-positive GBM regardless of genetic alterations or kinase activity. GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDX) harboring MET amplification (MET<sup>amp</sup>) or PTPRZ-MET fusion (ZM) were propagated in vivo followed by glioma stem cell (GSC) isolation. Cell-based assays were used for comparing GSC survival in response to MET inhibitors and CAR T cells. Multi-panel cytokine release was analyzed to profile MET-CAR T cell activation during co-culture with GBM. Orthotopic tumor growth and real-time imaging were performed to evaluate MET-CAR T cell therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Although GBM are heterogeneous tumors, neuro-sphere cells isolated from MET<sup>amp</sup> or ZM fusion PDX tumors showed universal cognate genetic MET alteration along with GSC markers such as SOX2 and nestin. Both MET<sup>amp</sup> and ZM fusion tumors showed MET overexpression but only the MET<sup>amp</sup> cells presented activated MET signaling which was vulnerable to MET inhibitors. In contrast, MET-CAR T cells specifically inhibited all MET-positive tumor growth regardless of MET activation status. Whereas MET inhibitors are effective in MET-active tumors, MET-CAR T cells eradicate MET-positive GBM growth in an antigen-dependent manner, demonstrating a promising therapeutic approach for treating MET-positive GBM.

"Several pharmacy schools in Saudi Arabia (S.A.) refer to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) pharmacotherapy toolkit in developing their pharmacotherapy curriculum. However, the ACCP toolkit does not specifically address the healthcare needs of the Saudi population. A tailored pharmacotherapy curriculum that offers graduates the essential competencies to better serve the nation's needs is warranted. This study aims to develop a population-centered didactic pharmacotherapy toolkit for the Saudi population to assist pharmacy schools in designing pharmacotherapy course content. This study employed a modified Delphi method to achieve consensus among expert pharmacists on prioritizing the tiers of the 2019 ACCP Pharmacotherapy Didactic Curriculum toolkit. A questionnaire was distributed over three rounds to gather input. Following the Delphi rounds, subject matter experts from professional organizations reviewed sections of the developed toolkit and assessed the consensus tiers and unresolved topics. The research steering group then proposed additional amendments based on the latest edition of the ACCP toolkit, released in 2024. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Fifty-six panel members participated in the first Delphi round. After three rounds, the panel reached a consensus on 234 of the 300 topics. The consensus on the remaining 57 topics was achieved through the Pharmacy Specialty Network groups and the Saudi Oncology Pharmacy Assembly. The finalized Saudi toolkit included 234 topics (tier 1 = 86, tier 2 = 86, tier 3 = 62). The toolkit aligned with the tier ranking of 184 topics of the ACCP 2023 edition; however, 50 topic tiers were changed, either escalated (26), de-escalated (17), removed (3), or retained (5). Additionally, two new topics-""Mass Gathering Medicine"" and ""Other Infections (e.g., brucellosis and dengue fever)""-were added to the infectious diseases section. This study introduces Saudi Arabia's first Pharmacotherapy Didactic Curriculum toolkit, providing standardized, culturally relevant resources for pharmacy education nationwide.

"As part of the innate immune system, NK cells contribute to optimizing cancer immunotherapy strategies and are becoming a focal point in cancer research. However, limited research has been conducted to further investigate changes in NK cell subsets and their critical genes following ibrutinib treatment in CLL patients. Peripheral blood samples from patients clinically and pathologically diagnosed with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL), newly diagnosed with CLL (ND-CLL), postibrutinib-treated patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and those with Richter's syndrome (RS) were collected. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing was performed, followed by pseudotemporal analysis and functional enrichment to characterize the NK cell subsets. Mendelian randomization analysis and colocalization analysis were employed to identify key genes. Multiple algorithms were used for immune infiltration analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis was conducted to pinpoint potential therapeutic agents. Three distinct NK cell subsets were identified: CD56bright_NK cells, CD56dim_NK cells, and a highly cytotoxic CLL_NK subset. The core genes of the CLL_NK subset were elucidated through Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses. A cell subset-specific novel index (CNI) was constructed based on these core genes and was shown to be capable of predicting responses to immunotherapy. Oncopredictive algorithms and molecular docking screenings further identified semaxanib and ulixertinib as potential therapeutic candidates for CLL. The CLL_NK subset plays a crucial role in the development and progression of CLL. The CNI, derived from its key genes, holds promise as a predictor of immune therapeutic responses, highlighting the significance of CLL_NK subset dynamics and their genetic underpinnings in CLL management.",AI in Oncology,part innate immune system nk cells contribute optimizing cancer immunotherapy strategies becoming focal point cancer research however limited research conducted investigate changes nk cell subsets critical genes following ibrutinib treatment cll patients peripheral blood samples patients clinically pathologically diagnosed monoclonal bcell lymphocytosis mbl newly diagnosed cll ndcll postibrutinibtreated patients achieved complete response cr partial response pr richters syndrome rs collected singlecell transcriptome sequencing performed followed pseudotemporal analysis functional enrichment characterize nk cell subsets mendelian randomization analysis colocalization analysis employed identify key genes multiple algorithms used immune infiltration analysis drug sensitivity analysis conducted pinpoint potential therapeutic agents three distinct nk cell subsets identified cdbrightnk cells cddimnk cells highly cytotoxic cllnk subset core genes cllnk subset elucidated mendelian randomization colocalization analyses cell subsetspecific novel index cni constructed based core genes shown capable predicting responses immunotherapy oncopredictive algorithms molecular docking screenings identified semaxanib ulixertinib potential therapeutic candidates cll cllnk subset plays crucial role development progression cll cni derived key genes holds promise predictor immune therapeutic responses highlighting significance cllnk subset dynamics genetic underpinnings cll management,AI in Oncology
"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the sixth most common cancer worldwide, presents significant public health challenges due to its genetic instability and late-stage diagnosis. Despite advancements in treatment, the median overall survival remains below one year, emphasizing the need for improved detection, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the role of KDM4C and its interaction with GATA1 in regulating heme metabolism and tumor progression in HNSCC. KDM4C knockdown (KDM4C-KD) hindered HNSCC cell migration using in vitro assays, inhibited metastasis through zebrafish xenotransplantation, and suppressed tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. RNA-seq and CUT&Tag-seq analyses on KDM4C-KD SAS cells identified KDM4C-regulated genes, including ferrochelatase (FECH), in heme metabolism. Immunoprecipitation and docking analyses confirmed the KDM4C-GATA1 interaction. Notably, FECH overexpression in KDM4C or GATA1 knockdown cells restored cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, highlighting FECH as a crucial downstream target. KDM4 inhibitors myricetin and BPRKD022S0 (22S0) increased H3K9me3 levels, downregulated heme metabolism genes, and reduced cell survival in HNSCC cells. Zebrafish and mouse models demonstrated that these inhibitors effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis of HNSCC patient samples revealed high KDM4C and GATA1 expression correlated with advanced clinical stages and poor survival outcomes. Our findings elucidate the critical role of the KDM4C/GATA1-FECH axis in HNSCC progression and suggest that targeting this pathway with KDM4 inhibitors shows promising therapeutic potential for HNSCC treatment.",AI in Oncology,head neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc sixth common cancer worldwide presents significant public health challenges due genetic instability latestage diagnosis despite advancements treatment median overall survival remains one year emphasizing need improved detection prognosis therapeutic strategies study investigates role kdmc interaction gata regulating heme metabolism tumor progression hnscc kdmc knockdown kdmckd hindered hnscc cell migration using vitro assays inhibited metastasis zebrafish xenotransplantation suppressed tumor growth mouse xenograft models rnaseq cuttagseq analyses kdmckd sas cells identified kdmcregulated genes including ferrochelatase fech heme metabolism immunoprecipitation docking analyses confirmed kdmcgata interaction notably fech overexpression kdmc gata knockdown cells restored cell migration invasion proliferation highlighting fech crucial downstream target kdm inhibitors myricetin bprkds increased hkme levels downregulated heme metabolism genes reduced cell survival hnscc cells zebrafish mouse models demonstrated inhibitors effectively suppressed tumor growth metastasis immunohistochemical analysis hnscc patient samples revealed high kdmc gata expression correlated advanced clinical stages poor survival outcomes findings elucidate critical role kdmcgatafech axis hnscc progression suggest targeting pathway kdm inhibitors shows promising therapeutic potential hnscc treatment,AI in Oncology
"Commensal bacteria have been implicated in the modulation of steroid hormones, including circulating androgen levels in the host. However, the microbial genetic pathways involved in androgen production have not been fully characterized. Here we identify a microbial gene encoding an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of androstenedione to epitestosterone in the gut microbiome member Clostridium scindens and named this gene desF. We demonstrate that epitestosterone impacts androgen receptor-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. We also demonstrate that stool desF levels are elevated in patients with prostate cancer who are unresponsive to abiraterone/prednisone therapy. Bacterial isolates from urine or prostatectomy tissue produced androgens, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity encoded by the desG gene was detected in strains of the urinary tract bacterium Propionimicrobium lymphophilum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that urinary androgen-producing bacterial strains can promote prostate cancer cell growth through metabolism of cortisol and prednisone. Abiraterone, which targets host desmolase (CYP17A1), a rate-limiting enzyme in adrenal steroidogenesis, does not inhibit bacterial desmolase (DesAB), whereas the conversion of prednisone to androgens by DesAB, DesF and DesG drives androgen-receptor-dependent prostate cancer cell line proliferation in vitro.

"Historically, fewer than 10% of adults with cancer have enrolled in clinical trials. Computational tools have been developed to match patients to trials, but these tools are relevant only when patients need new treatment. To evaluate whether notifying oncologists about genomically targeted clinical trials for patients with cancer progression, as detected by artificial intelligence (AI), impacts clinical trial participation. This single-center randomized trial was conducted from January 30, 2023, to June 30, 2024, at a tertiary academic cancer center. Participants were patients aged at least 18 years in a precision oncology clinical trial matching database who had solid tumors that underwent next-generation sequencing from July 2013 to December 2022, and were alive as of January 30, 2023. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to the intervention or control arm. In the intervention arm, when patients had cancer progression and an elevated probability of starting new treatment based on AI applied to their imaging reports, notifications about genomically matched clinical trials were sent to their oncologists. In the control arm, no such notifications were sent. The primary outcome was enrollment in any therapeutic clinical trial. Prespecified secondary outcomes included consent to any therapeutic trial, consent and enrollment among patients ever ascertained as trial ready, the proportion of new systemic therapies that were given as part of clinical trials, and survey responses from clinicians who received notifications. Of 20 707 patients randomized (57.26% female; median age at the time of sequencing, 60 years [IQR, 50-69 years]), 13 802 were randomized to the intervention arm and 6905 to the control arm. The intervention had no significant impact on the trial enrollment rate (intervention, 2.20% [95% CI, 1.97%-2.46%]; control, 2.03% [95% CI, 1.72%-2.39%]; difference, 0.18 [95% CI, -0.25 to 0.58] percentage points; P = .41). Similarly, there were no significant differences in trial enrollment between the intervention and control arms among the 2127 patients ever ascertained as trial ready (18.05% [95% CI, 16.15%-20.12%] vs 18.50% [95% CI, 15.78%-21.56%]; difference, -0.45 [95% CI, -4.01 to 3.02] percentage points; P = .80) or among the 2036 patients who ever started new systemic therapy (22.67% [95% CI, 20.51%-24.99%] vs 20.14% [95% CI, 17.33%-23.29%]; difference, 2.53 [95% CI, -1.25 to 6.21] percentage points; P = .19). In this randomized trial, prompting academic medical oncologists with information about genomically matched therapeutic clinical trials for patients with tumor progression based on AI interpretation of imaging reports did not increase therapeutic trial enrollment.

"The treatment options for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain limited. It is therefore important to explore new therapeutic targets and strategies for better treatment and prognosis for patients with PDAC. NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in PDAC development. Moreover, NEK7 was reported to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome and cell pyroptosis. To evaluate the role of NEK7 in PDAC, we performed RNA sequencing analysis in PDAC cells, and a series of bioinformatics analyses were employed to determine the biological function of NEK7 in PDAC. We identified a NEK7-Specific Pyroptosis Gene Set (NEK7-SPGS) by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing combining Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We reveal that NEK7-SPGS is highly associated with T helper cell infiltration and inflammatory response of PDAC. We therefore proposed that NEK7-SPGS might have potential for tumor microenvironment remodeling via T cells induced inflammatory response. Using dataset from TCGA database, we established a NEK7-SPGS-related prognostic signature for patients with PDAC. Subsequently, sensitivity estimation of chemotherapeutic drugs revealed a series of chemotherapy agents according to the NEK7-SPGS-related prognostic signature, including gemcitabine and paclitaxel, drugs that have been used as conventional agents for PDAC therapy. Meanwhile, we showed that the expression of SCAMP1, which is a member of NEK7-SPGS, was involved in the progression of PDAC in vivo and in vitro. We proposed a NEK7-specific pyroptosis gene signature and evaluated its potential in PDAC tumor microenvironment. The NEK7-SPGS-related prognostic signature could act as a prognostic biomarker and serve as therapeutic guidance in clinical application.",AI in Oncology,treatment options pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac remain limited therefore important explore new therapeutic targets strategies better treatment prognosis patients pdac nimarelated kinase nek serinethreonine kinase involved pdac development moreover nek reported regulate nlrp inflammasome cell pyroptosis evaluate role nek pdac performed rna sequencing analysis pdac cells series bioinformatics analyses employed determine biological function nek pdac identified nekspecific pyroptosis gene set nekspgs highthroughput transcriptome sequencing combining gene set enrichment analysis gsea reveal nekspgs highly associated helper cell infiltration inflammatory response pdac therefore proposed nekspgs might potential tumor microenvironment remodeling via cells induced inflammatory response using dataset tcga database established nekspgsrelated prognostic signature patients pdac subsequently sensitivity estimation chemotherapeutic drugs revealed series chemotherapy agents according nekspgsrelated prognostic signature including gemcitabine paclitaxel drugs used conventional agents pdac therapy meanwhile showed expression scamp member nekspgs involved progression pdac vivo vitro proposed nekspecific pyroptosis gene signature evaluated potential pdac tumor microenvironment nekspgsrelated prognostic signature could act prognostic biomarker serve therapeutic guidance clinical application,AI in Oncology
"Endometrial cancer (EC) is a prevalent gynecological malignancy with a complex molecular landscape, contributing to significant global morbidity and mortality. Dysregulated signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK drive EC progression by promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Mutations in genes like PTEN and PIK3CA further underpin tumor aggressiveness. Molecular alterations in these pathways not only serve as biomarkers for prognosis but also guide the formulation of targeted therapies, such as mTOR inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents. While such therapies show promise, optimizing their efficacy and minimizing adverse effects requires further research. A comprehensive approach integrating early detection (e.g., addressing postmenopausal bleeding), preventive strategies (e.g., managing obesity), increasing diagnostic sensitivity (e.g., transvaginal ultrasound) and advanced molecularly tailored treatments (e.g., AI & ML) is critical to reducing the burden of this disease.

"AI modeling CDM can improve the quality and efficiency of clinical practice or provide secondary opinion consultations for patients with limited medical resources to address healthcare disparities. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI model to select radiotherapy treatment options, that is, whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) versus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), for patients with brain metastases. A total of 232 patients with brain metastases treated by radiation therapy from 2018 to 2023 were obtained. CT/MR images with contoured target lesions and organs-at-risk (OARs) as well as non-image-based clinical parameters were extracted and digitized as inputs to the model. These parameters included (1) tumor size, shape, location, and proximity of lesions to OARs; (2) age; (3) the number of brain metastases; (4) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status; (5) presence of neurologic symptoms; (6) if surgery was performed (either pre/post-op RT); (7) newly diagnosed cancer with brain metastases (de-novo) versus re-treatment (either local or distant in the brain); (8) primary cancer histology; (9) presence of extracranial metastases; (10) extent of extracranial disease (progression vs. stable); and (11) receipt of systemic therapy. One vanilla and two interpretable 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) models were developed. The vanilla one-path model (VM-1) uses only images as input, while the two interpretable models use both images and clinical parameters as inputs with two (IM-2) and 11 (IM-11) independent paths, respectively. This novel design allowed the model to calculate a class activation score for each input to interpret its relative weighting and importance in decision-making. The actual radiotherapy treatment (WBRT or SRS) used for the patients was used as ground truth for model training. The model performance was assessed by Stratified-10-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of selected 184 training, 24 validation, and 24 testing subjects. A total of 232 brain metastases patients treated by WBRT or SRS were evaluated, including 80 WBRT and 152 SRS patients. Based on the images alone, the VM-1 model prescribed correctly for 143 (94%) SRS and 67 (84%) WBRT cases. Based on both images and clinical parameters, the IM-2 model prescribed correctly for 149 (98%) SRS and 74 (93%) WBRT cases. IM-11 provided the most interpretability with a relative weighting for each input as follows: CT image (59.5%), ECOG performance status (7.5%), re-treatment (5%), extracranial metastases (1.5%), number of brain metastases (9.5%), neurologic symptoms (3%), pre/post-surgery (2%), primary cancer histology (2%), age (1%), progressive extracranial disease (6%), and receipt of systemic therapy (4.5%), reflecting the importance of all these inputs in clinical decision-making. Interpretable CNN models were successfully developed to use CT/MR images and non-image-based clinical parameters to predict the treatment selection between WBRT and SRS for brain metastases patients. The interpretability makes the model more transparent, carrying profound importance for the prospective integration of these models into routine clinical practice, particularly for informing real-time clinical decision-making.",AI in Oncology,ai modeling cdm improve quality efficiency clinical practice provide secondary opinion consultations patients limited medical resources address healthcare disparities study developed interpretable ai model select radiotherapy treatment options wholebrain radiation therapy wbrt versus stereotactic radiosurgery srs patients brain metastases total patients brain metastases treated radiation therapy obtained ctmr images contoured target lesions organsatrisk oars well nonimagebased clinical parameters extracted digitized inputs model parameters included tumor size shape location proximity lesions oars age number brain metastases eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance status presence neurologic symptoms surgery performed either prepostop rt newly diagnosed cancer brain metastases denovo versus retreatment either local distant brain primary cancer histology presence extracranial metastases extent extracranial disease progression vs stable receipt systemic therapy one vanilla two interpretable convolutional neural networks cnn models developed vanilla onepath model vm uses images input two interpretable models use images clinical parameters inputs two im im independent paths respectively novel design allowed model calculate class activation score input interpret relative weighting importance decisionmaking actual radiotherapy treatment wbrt srs used patients used ground truth model training model performance assessed stratifiedfold crossvalidation fold consisting selected training validation testing subjects total brain metastases patients treated wbrt srs evaluated including wbrt srs patients based images alone vm model prescribed correctly srs wbrt cases based images clinical parameters im model prescribed correctly srs wbrt cases im provided interpretability relative weighting input follows ct image ecog performance status retreatment extracranial metastases number brain metastases neurologic symptoms prepostsurgery primary cancer histology age progressive extracranial disease receipt systemic therapy reflecting importance inputs clinical decisionmaking interpretable cnn models successfully developed use ctmr images nonimagebased clinical parameters predict treatment selection wbrt srs brain metastases patients interpretability makes model transparent carrying profound importance prospective integration models routine clinical practice particularly informing realtime clinical decisionmaking,AI in Oncology
"Cell crowding is a common microenvironmental factor influencing various disease processes, but its role in promoting cell invasiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Crowding specifically enhanced invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells through significant volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that crowding selectively relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, to the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. TRPV4 inhibition triggered by crowding decreased intracellular calcium levels, reduced cell volume, and increased invasion and motility. During this process, TRPV4 membrane relocation primed the channel for later activation, compensating for calcium loss. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues confirmed that plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 is specific to high-grade DCIS and indicates the presence of a pro-invasive cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway. Hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked crowding-induced effects, while TRPV4 activation reversed them. Silencing TRPV4 diminished mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells, reducing calcium depletion, volume reduction, and motility. This study uncovers a novel pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway driven by cell crowding and identifies TRPV4 as a potential biomarker for predicting invasion risk in DCIS patients.",AI in Oncology,cell crowding common microenvironmental factor influencing various disease processes role promoting cell invasiveness remains unclear study investigates biomechanical changes induced cell crowding focusing proinvasive cell volume reduction ductal carcinoma situ dcis crowding specifically enhanced invasiveness highgrade dcis cells significant volume reduction compared hyperplasiamimicking normal cells mass spectrometry revealed crowding selectively relocated ion channels including trpv plasma membrane highgrade dcis cells trpv inhibition triggered crowding decreased intracellular calcium levels reduced cell volume increased invasion motility process trpv membrane relocation primed channel later activation compensating calcium loss analyses patientderived breast cancer tissues confirmed plasma membraneassociated trpv specific highgrade dcis indicates presence proinvasive cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway hyperosmotic conditions pharmacologic trpv inhibition mimicked crowdinginduced effects trpv activation reversed silencing trpv diminished mechanotransduction highgrade dcis cells reducing calcium depletion volume reduction motility study uncovers novel proinvasive mechanotransduction pathway driven cell crowding identifies trpv potential biomarker predicting invasion risk dcis patients,AI in Oncology

"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an important biomarker increasingly used as a predictive marker in breast cancer immunotherapy. Immunohistochemical quantification remains the standard method for assessment. However, it presents challenges related to time, cost, and reliability. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a routine method in cancer pathology, known for its accessibility and consistently reliability. Deep learning has shown the potential in predicting biomarkers in cancer histopathology. This study employs a weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) approach to predict PD-L1 expression from H&E-stained images using deep learning techniques. In the internal test set, the TransMIL method achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.833, and in an independent external test set, it achieved an AUC of 0.799. Additionally, since RNA sequencing results indicate a threshold that allows for the separation of H&E pathology images, we further validated our approach using the public TCGA-TNBC dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.721. These findings demonstrates that the Transformer-based TransMIL model can effectively capture highly heterogeneous features within the MIL framework, exhibiting strong cross-center generalization capabilities. Our study highlights that appropriate deep learning techniques can enable effective PD-L1 prediction even with limited data, and across diverse regions and centers. This not only underscores the significant potential of deep learning in pathological artificial intelligence (AI) but also provides valuable insights for the rational and efficient allocation of medical resources.",AI in Oncology,programmed deathligand pdl important biomarker increasingly used predictive marker breast cancer immunotherapy immunohistochemical quantification remains standard method assessment however presents challenges related time cost reliability hematoxylin eosin staining routine method cancer pathology known accessibility consistently reliability deep learning shown potential predicting biomarkers cancer histopathology study employs weakly supervised multiple instance learning mil approach predict pdl expression hestained images using deep learning techniques internal test set transmil method achieved area curve auc independent external test set achieved auc additionally since rna sequencing results indicate threshold allows separation pathology images validated approach using public tcgatnbc dataset achieving auc findings demonstrates transformerbased transmil model effectively capture highly heterogeneous features within mil framework exhibiting strong crosscenter generalization capabilities study highlights appropriate deep learning techniques enable effective pdl prediction even limited data across diverse regions centers underscores significant potential deep learning pathological artificial intelligence ai also provides valuable insights rational efficient allocation medical resources,AI in Oncology
"To examine the roles and mechanisms of tanshinone IIA (Tan-IIA) in colorectal cancer (CRC) using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro experiments. In network pharmacology studies, Tan-IIA targets for treating CRC were identified using public databases. Employing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, gene ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, the core genes and mechanisms of action of Tan-IIA were obtained. Core targets were validated using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, the Human Protein Atlas, DriverDBv3, cBioPortal, and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database. Molecular docking validates the binding affinity of Tan-IIA to some key targets. Network pharmacology and molecular docking results were validated via in vitro experiments. Intersecting Tan-IIA and CRC targets led to the identification of 25 potential targets. PPI analysis identified 10 core targets of Tan-IIA for CRC treatment. Database validation revealed that these core targets were expressed at varying levels in both normal and cancer tissues. Their expression could influence patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration levels. GO analysis revealed 170 biological processes, 42 cellular components, and 83 molecular functions. KEGG analysis indicated that Tan-IIA affected CRC through multiple pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), cAMP, and TNF signaling pathways, with the PI3K/AKT pathway being the most enriched. Molecular docking results indicated that Tan-IIA effectively binds to PI3K, AKT, and other partial core targets. In vitro experiments revealed that Tan-IIA suppressed the multiplication and migration of HCT116 and SW480 cells, induced apoptosis, and reduced the PI3K/AKT pathway indicator protein expression, which was reversed by the PI3K/AKT pathway agonist insulin-like growth factor-1. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro validation confirmed that Tan-IIA contributes to CRC treatment through the PI3K/AKT pathway, providing theoretical and experimental foundations for its potential clinical application.",AI in Oncology,examine roles mechanisms tanshinone iia taniia colorectal cancer crc using network pharmacology molecular docking vitro experiments network pharmacology studies taniia targets treating crc identified using public databases employing proteinprotein interaction ppi network gene ontology go enrichment kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes kegg pathway analyses core genes mechanisms action taniia obtained core targets validated using gene expression profiling interactive analysis human protein atlas driverdbv cbioportal tumor immune estimation resource database molecular docking validates binding affinity taniia key targets network pharmacology molecular docking results validated via vitro experiments intersecting taniia crc targets led identification potential targets ppi analysis identified core targets taniia crc treatment database validation revealed core targets expressed varying levels normal cancer tissues expression could influence patient prognosis immune cell infiltration levels go analysis revealed biological processes cellular components molecular functions kegg analysis indicated taniia affected crc multiple pathways including phosphoinositide kinaseprotein kinase b pikakt camp tnf signaling pathways pikakt pathway enriched molecular docking results indicated taniia effectively binds pik akt partial core targets vitro experiments revealed taniia suppressed multiplication migration hct sw cells induced apoptosis reduced pikakt pathway indicator protein expression reversed pikakt pathway agonist insulinlike growth factor network pharmacology molecular docking vitro validation confirmed taniia contributes crc treatment pikakt pathway providing theoretical experimental foundations potential clinical application,AI in Oncology
"HER2-positive advanced breast cancer poses significant treatment challenges. In China, T-DM1 and pyrotinib are key second-line therapies. A comprehensive evaluation of the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of these therapies is imperative for optimizing therapeutic strategies and enhancing patient outcomes. This study aims to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of T-DM1 against pyrotinib plus capecitabine. Patients are females with HER2-positive, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer who at least 18 years old and have received anti-HER2 therapy in the past. This study included 148 patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria. Of these, 74 patients received intravenous T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg) every 21 days, while the other 74 patients got oral pyrotinib (400 mg, once daily) plus capecitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, twice daily on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the main outcome, while overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs) were the secondary outcomes. The median PFS was 12.2 months for the pyrotinib group vs 9.1 months for the T-DM1 group. The median follow-up was 12.7 months for pyrotinib and 9.3 months for T-DM1. The pyrotinib group had better DCR (56.8% vs 54.1%) and ORR (40.5% vs 29.7%). While adverse events were manageable, the most common severe AE in the pyrotinib group was diarrhea (24.3%), and in the T-DM1 group, it was thrombocytopenia (16.2%). However, by reducing the drug dosage or providing symptomatic treatment, most adverse events could be controlled at grades 1 to 2, indicating that the adverse events were manageable. Neither group recorded any adverse event-related deaths. Pyrotinib plus capecitabine significantly improves median PFS compared to T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, demonstrating a favorable efficacy profile alongside manageable safety concerns.",AI in Oncology,herpositive advanced breast cancer poses significant treatment challenges china tdm pyrotinib key secondline therapies comprehensive evaluation comparative efficacy safety profiles therapies imperative optimizing therapeutic strategies enhancing patient outcomes study aims compare clinical efficacy safety tdm pyrotinib plus capecitabine patients females herpositive locally advanced metastatic breast cancer least years old received antiher therapy past study included patients satisfied inclusion criteria patients received intravenous tdm mgkg every days patients got oral pyrotinib mg daily plus capecitabine mgmsupsup twice daily days day cycle progressionfree survival pfs main outcome overall survival os objective response rate orr disease control rate dcr adverse events aes secondary outcomes median pfs months pyrotinib group vs months tdm group median followup months pyrotinib months tdm pyrotinib group better dcr vs orr vs adverse events manageable common severe ae pyrotinib group diarrhea tdm group thrombocytopenia however reducing drug dosage providing symptomatic treatment adverse events could controlled grades indicating adverse events manageable neither group recorded adverse eventrelated deaths pyrotinib plus capecitabine significantly improves median pfs compared tdm patients herpositive advanced breast cancer demonstrating favorable efficacy profile alongside manageable safety concerns,AI in Oncology
"This study aims to identify specific molecular targets sensitive to AZD6738 through the integration of network pharmacology and transcriptomic methods, and to assess their potential role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, we explore the specific effects of AZD6738 on the tumor microenvironment and its ability to regulate immune responses. We employed a combination of network pharmacology and transcriptomic analysis to identify specific molecules associated with HCC, including EZH2, CCNB1, PRKDC, CTSL, PSEN1, SLC6A3, and FKBP1A. Using these molecules and clinical features, we constructed a robust prognostic model for HCC. We further used single-cell transcriptomic technology to screen for core targets and performed spatial transcriptomic analysis to determine their spatial distribution. To validate the efficacy of AZD6738 in vivo, we established a subcutaneous tumor model, with the experimental group receiving oral administration of AZD6738 (75 mg/kg). Finally, we assessed the changes in the immune cell expression profile in tumor tissues post-AZD6738 treatment using flow cytometry. Our study indicates that the high expression of genes such as EZH2, CCNB1, PRKDC, and PSEN1 is associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Molecular docking and RT-PCR validation demonstrated that AZD6738 exhibits high affinity for these targets and significantly reduces the mRNA levels of EZH2, PRKDC, and CCNB1 in HCC cell lines, with EZH2 showing the most pronounced decrease. Animal experiments revealed that AZD6738 can enhance the immune microenvironment in liver cancer; specifically, AZD6738 not only promotes the proliferation of CD8+ T cells but also enhances their differentiation into effector memory T cells, indicating that the drug can potentiate anti-tumor immune responses.

"Despite advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a proportion of patients still hardly achieve desired prognosis. Although microtransplant (MST) has proved promising results in treating several hematological malignancies, it has not been studied in multiple myeloma. We performed a retrospective analysis of multiple myeloma patients treated with MST at our institution. Their clinical information and outcome measurements were collected. Furthermore, the fluctuation of donor microchimerism after MST, as well as the alteration of immune function before and after MST were analyzed. Twenty patients receiving MST were enrolled from June 2008, to May 2024, with an overall response rate of 17/20. The 6-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 64.7% and 35.3%, respectively, with no graft-versus-host disease or non-relapse mortality. Incidence of controlled fever and Grade I cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was 40.8%. The OS were comparable between groups with age, International Staging System stage, and Mayo Stratification of Myeloma and Risk-Adapted Therapy stage. However, earlier Durie-Salmon stage, disease in VGPR or CR status prior to MST, and an increase in total cycle number of MST were significantly associated with longer OS. Donor microchimerism was detected in all available peripheral blood samples from 14 days to 6 months post-MST. Furthermore, MST resulted in increased proportions of total CD3+ T cells, and CD4+CD8- T cells in peripheral blood, as well as improved CD4:CD8 ratio and increased proportions of Th0 cells.

"Both medical care and observational studies in oncology require a thorough understanding of a patient's disease progression and treatment history, often elaborately documented within clinical notes. As large language models (LLMs) are being considered for use within medical workflows, it becomes important to evaluate their potential in oncology. However, no current information representation schema fully encapsulates the diversity of oncology information within clinical notes, and no comprehensively annotated oncology notes exist publicly, thereby limiting a thorough evaluation. We curated a new fine-grained, expert-labeled dataset of 40 deidentified breast and pancreatic cancer progress notes at the University of California, San Francisco, and assessed the abilities of three recent LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and FLAN-UL2) in <i>zero-shot</i> extraction of detailed oncological information from two narrative sections of clinical progress notes. Model performance was quantified with BLEU-4, ROUGE-1, and exact-match (EM) F1 score metrics. Our team annotated 9028 entities, 9986 modifiers, and 5312 relationships. The GPT-4 model exhibited overall best performance, with an average BLEU score of 0.73, an average ROUGE score of 0.72, an average EM F1 score of 0.51, and an average accuracy of 68% (expert manual evaluation on subset). Notably, GPT-4 was proficient in tumor characteristic and medication extraction and demonstrated superior performance in advanced reasoning tasks of inferring symptoms due to cancer and considerations of future medications. Common errors included partial responses with missing information and hallucinations with note-specific information. By developing a comprehensive schema and benchmark of oncology-specific information in oncology notes, we uncovered both the strengths and the limitations of LLMs. Our evaluation showed variable zero-shot extraction capability among the GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and FLAN-UL2 models and highlighted a need for further improvements, particularly in complex medical reasoning, before performing reliable information extraction for clinical research and complex population management and documenting quality patient care.

"Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with most cases diagnosed at advanced stages, resulting in poor survival rates. Early detection significantly improves outcomes, yet current screening methods, such as low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), are limited by high false-positive rates, radiation exposure, and restricted eligibility criteria. This review highlights the transformative potential of genomic and molecular technologies in advancing the early detection of LC. Key innovations include liquid biopsy tools, such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis, which offer minimally invasive approaches to detect tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic alterations. Emerging biomarkers, including methylation signatures, cfDNA fragmentomics, and multi-omics profiles, demonstrate improved sensitivity and specificity in identifying early-stage tumors. Advanced platforms like next-generation sequencing (NGS) and machine-learning algorithms further enhance diagnostic accuracy. Integrated approaches that combine genomic data with LDCT imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) show promise in addressing current limitations by improving risk stratification and nodule characterization.

"ERK5 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its pivotal role in regulating tumor cell proliferation and survival. In this study, we synthesized novel derivatives of 1,4-dialkoxynaphthalene-2-acyl or 2-alkyl-imidazolium salt (NAIMS), assessed their binding affinity with the ERK5 protein through molecular modeling, and evaluated their anti-cancer activity through the ERK5 kinase assay. Based on the MTT assay and qRT-PCR analysis of 21 synthesized NAIMS, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for 4c, 4e, and 4k (8.5 μM, 6.8 μM, and 8.9 μM, respectively) and the inhibition rate of the expression of PCNA for 4c, 4e, and 4k (50%, 61.1%, and 70.2% of 5 μM respectively) were chosen for comprehensive biological research. Further analyses including DAPI staining, and flow cytometry confirmed that 4c, 4e, and 4k induced late-stage apoptosis, and triggered cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase of HeLa cells. Moreover, molecular modeling analysis showed that 4e exhibited strong and stable molecular interactions at the ERK5 ATP-binding site. Our results strongly suggest that NAIMS compounds, especially 4e, could serve as novel inhibitors of ERK5, presenting promising lead compound to develop for cancer treatment.",AI in Oncology,erk emerged promising therapeutic target cancer treatment due pivotal role regulating tumor cell proliferation survival study synthesized novel derivatives dialkoxynaphthaleneacyl alkylimidazolium salt naims assessed binding affinity erk protein molecular modeling evaluated anticancer activity erk kinase assay based mtt assay qrtpcr analysis synthesized naims icsubsub values c e k respectively inhibition rate expression pcna c e k respectively chosen comprehensive biological research analyses including dapi staining flow cytometry confirmed c e k induced latestage apoptosis triggered cell cycle arrest gm phase hela cells moreover molecular modeling analysis showed e exhibited strong stable molecular interactions erk atpbinding site results strongly suggest naims compounds especially e could serve novel inhibitors erk presenting promising lead compound develop cancer treatment,AI in Oncology
"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) presents challenges in prognostic prediction. This study aimed to develop a universal foundation model-driven multimodal model (FoMu model) to assess the prognosis of HGSOC patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 712 eligible patients across four centers, collecting clinical, MRI, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) data. Pre-trained radiological and pathological foundation models were employed for feature precoding. Subsequently, we introduced unimodal and cross-modal adaptive aggregation networks to comprehensively model the features derived from each modality. Our findings revealed that both unimodal and cross-modal FoMu models exhibited superior and stable predictive capabilities for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In summary, our study successfully developed a FoMu model that effectively integrates multimodal data to assess the prognoses of HGSOC patients, highlighting its potential for improving individualized patient management and clinical decision-making in future applications.",AI in Oncology,highgrade serous ovarian cancer hgsoc presents challenges prognostic prediction study aimed develop universal foundation modeldriven multimodal model fomu model assess prognosis hgsoc patients conducted retrospective cohort study involving eligible patients across four centers collecting clinical mri hematoxylin eosin hestained whole slide images wsis data pretrained radiological pathological foundation models employed feature precoding subsequently introduced unimodal crossmodal adaptive aggregation networks comprehensively model features derived modality findings revealed unimodal crossmodal fomu models exhibited superior stable predictive capabilities overall survival os progressionfree survival pfs summary study successfully developed fomu model effectively integrates multimodal data assess prognoses hgsoc patients highlighting potential improving individualized patient management clinical decisionmaking future applications,AI in Oncology
"The MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor-X2 (MRGPRX2), an orphan receptor expressed on mast cells (MCs), is upregulated upon inflammation and induces hypersensitivity and inflammatory diseases. In contrast to the large number of MRGPRX2 agonists, only a few antagonists have been described, and no optimization has been reported to improve potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties. Antagonists with ancillary inhibition of the putative mouse ortholog MRGPRB2 have not been described. Here, we present a multi-disciplinary approach involving chemistry, biology, and computational science, resulting in the development of a small-molecule MRGPRX2 antagonist (PSB-172656, 3-ethyl-7,8-difluoro-2-isopropylbenzo[4,5]imidazo [1,2-a] pyrimidin-4(1H)-one) based on a fragment screening hit. The compound exhibits metabolic stability, low cytotoxicity, and competitive blockade of MRGPRX2 activation induced by a diverse range of agonists. It displays subnanomolar potency in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization assays (K<sub>i</sub> value 0.142 nM) and was found to block MRGPRX2-mediated Gα<sub>q</sub> and Gα<sub>i1</sub> dissociation, in addition to β-arrestin-2 recruitment. PSB-172656 is selective for MRGPRX2 versus all other MRGPRX subtypes. Its effect on MCs was confirmed in cell lines, including rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) recombinantly expressing human MRGPRX2, human Laboratory of Allergic Diseases 2 (LAD2) MCs, and native human skin MCs. PSB-172656 was found to additionally block the putative mouse ortholog of MRGPRX2, MRGPRB2, as determined in Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization assays (K<sub>i</sub> 0.302 nM), and to prevent mouse tracheal contractions, local allergic reactions, and systemic anaphylactic symptoms.

"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, but lethal cancer with low response rates to systemic therapies, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Despite extensive clinical trials, no effective treatments for patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC are available, and ACC mortality rates remain poor. We employed automated multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) Gene Expression analysis, RNA in-situ hybridization, and spatial transcriptomics analysis to characterize the immune landscape of ACC tumors, ACC metastasis, and normal tissues from regions where ACCs arise. Based on results from these studies, we treated freshly resected ACCs with interferon-γ or a stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) agonist in vitro. Additionally, we included one patient with ACC in a phase 1 clinical study of a novel STING agonist (dazostinag) plus pembrolizumab. The mIF analysis revealed that ACC tumors are immunologically ""cold"", with few tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes and low programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. The most striking finding was a very low beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression in nearly all ACCs, with only focal expression found in some ACC metastases. mIF and RNA sequencing analyses of normal salivary gland and breast tissues revealed a p63+, NFIB+, basal duct cell population, with similarly low B2M/human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression. Spatial transcriptomics analysis of the focally B2M-positive ACC metastases uncovered the genetic pathway driving upregulation of B2M, an interferon-γ program mediating the reintroduction of HLA-I/B2M; the significantly upregulated genes included <i>IRF1, GBP1,</i> and <i>TAP1</i>. On short-term treatment of primary ACC tissues in vitro with interferon-γ or a STING agonist, we observed strongly upregulated HLA class I/B2M expression. Moreover, treatment of a patient with recurrent, metastatic breast ACC with a STING agonist and pembrolizumab led to a partial response with a 70% tumor reduction. Low B2M/HLA class I expression may explain why ACCs are immunologically cold and the lack of response to ICIs. Our findings suggest that the normal cell of ACC origin exists in a B2M/HLA-class I low state, and that pharmacologic manipulation with immune activators, such as STING agonists, can restore HLA/B2M in ACCs, as supported by the promising response observed in a patient with metastatic ACC.

"Endogenous androgens are pivotal in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PC). We investigated nanoparticle formulations of curcumin and piperine in modulating steroidogenesis within PC cells. Using multiple PC cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU145 and PC3) we studied the effects of curcumin, piperine, and their nanoparticle formulations-curcumin nanoparticles, piperine nanoparticles, and curcumin-piperine nanoparticles (CPN)-on cell viability, migration, and steroid biosynthesis. Curcumin and its nanoparticle formulations significantly reduced cell viability in PC cells, with curcumin-piperine nanoparticles showing the highest efficacy. These treatments also inhibited cell migration, with CPN exhibiting the most pronounced effect. In assays for steroid biosynthesis, curcumin, and its nanoparticle formulations, as well as piperine and its nanoparticles, selectively inhibited 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1). Abiraterone, a CYP17A1 inhibitor, displayed a broader inhibition of steroid metabolism including cytochrome P450 21-hydroxylase activity, whereas curcumin and piperine provided a more targeted inhibition profile. Analysis of steroid metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that CPN caused significant reduction of androstenedione and cortisol, suggesting potential synergistic effects. In conclusion, nanoformulations co-loaded with curcumin and piperine offer an effective approach to targeting steroidogenesis and could be promising candidates for therapies aimed at managing androgen-dependent PC.",AI in Oncology,endogenous androgens pivotal development progression prostate cancer pc investigated nanoparticle formulations curcumin piperine modulating steroidogenesis within pc cells using multiple pc cell lines lncap vcap du pc studied effects curcumin piperine nanoparticle formulationscurcumin nanoparticles piperine nanoparticles curcuminpiperine nanoparticles cpnon cell viability migration steroid biosynthesis curcumin nanoparticle formulations significantly reduced cell viability pc cells curcuminpiperine nanoparticles showing highest efficacy treatments also inhibited cell migration cpn exhibiting pronounced effect assays steroid biosynthesis curcumin nanoparticle formulations well piperine nanoparticles selectively inhibited hydroxylase lyase activities cytochrome p cypa abiraterone cypa inhibitor displayed broader inhibition steroid metabolism including cytochrome p hydroxylase activity whereas curcumin piperine provided targeted inhibition profile analysis steroid metabolites liquid chromatographymass spectrometry revealed cpn caused significant reduction androstenedione cortisol suggesting potential synergistic effects conclusion nanoformulations coloaded curcumin piperine offer effective approach targeting steroidogenesis could promising candidates therapies aimed managing androgendependent pc,AI in Oncology
"We examined the impact of starting treatment on clinical outcomes in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). This retrospective observational cohort study used claims data from the Medical Data Vision (MDV) hospital-based administrative dataset in Japan. All patients with newly diagnosed mCSPC from 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2024 were enrolled and followed up until 30 September 2024. Time-to-event analyses used Kaplan-Meier methods. The risk of death, onset of castration resistance, time to ≥ 50% PSA decline (PSA50), ≥ 90% PSA decline (PSA90), and undetectable PSA level (≤ 0.2 ng/mL) was compared between androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and combined androgen blockade (CAB) or androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, body mass index, co-morbidities, visceral metastases, and baseline PSA. 22,559 patients with mCSPC had received relevant treatment of whom 15,797 were included in the analysis: 1167 (5.2%) started on apalutamide (APA) + ADT, 1407 (6.2%) on enzalutamide + ADT, 1262 (5.6%) on abiraterone acetate plus prednisone + ADT, and 11,961 (53.0%) on CAB/ADT alone. The median age was between 74 and 78 years in each group. Bone metastases were present in 60.5% to 72.6% of patients, visceral metastases in 2.8% to 5.7%, and nodal metastases in 19.3% to 29.4%. Overall survival and castration resistance-free survival were significantly longer in patients initially treated with APA + ADT compared to CAB/ADT (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). In patients with regular PSA assessment, a higher percentage of patients starting with APA + ADT achieved PSA50, PSA90 and undetectable PSA at 3 months compared with CAB/ADT (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0005, p < 0.0001, respectively).

"High-risk neuroblastoma frequently exhibits segmental gain of chromosome 17q, including the locus of PPM1D, which encodes the phosphatase WIP1, a regulator of p53 activity, DNA repair, and apoptosis. High expression of PPM1D is correlated to poor prognosis, and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of WIP1 suppresses neuroblastoma growth. Here, we show that combining drugs that target WIP1 and H3K27 demethylation induces synergistic cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma. We screened 527 different compounds together with inhibitors of WIP1 and identified a strong cytotoxic synergism between the WIP1 inhibitor SL-176 and GSK-J4, a specific inhibitor of the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3. Viability assays in neuroblastoma cell lines and treatment of tumor spheroids confirmed the synergistic effect of combining SL-176 with GSK-J4. Immunoblot experiments demonstrated a marked effect on WIP1 downstream targets and apoptosis markers, while qPCR showed a synergistic upregulation of p53 downstream targets PUMA and p21. RNA sequencing revealed a vast number of differentially expressed genes, suggesting a pervasive effect of this drug combination on transcription, with enrichment of pathways involved in DNA damage response. Finally, this drug combination was confirmed to reduce tumor growth in zebrafish xenograft experiments. In conclusion, the combination of the WIP1 inhibitor SL-176 and the epigenetic modifier GSK-J4 induces synergistic cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells by potentiating p53 downstream effects.",AI in Oncology,highrisk neuroblastoma frequently exhibits segmental gain chromosome q including locus ppmd encodes phosphatase wip regulator p activity dna repair apoptosis high expression ppmd correlated poor prognosis genetic pharmacologic inhibition wip suppresses neuroblastoma growth show combining drugs target wip hk demethylation induces synergistic cytotoxicity neuroblastoma screened different compounds together inhibitors wip identified strong cytotoxic synergism wip inhibitor sl gskj specific inhibitor hk demethylase jmjd viability assays neuroblastoma cell lines treatment tumor spheroids confirmed synergistic effect combining sl gskj immunoblot experiments demonstrated marked effect wip downstream targets apoptosis markers qpcr showed synergistic upregulation p downstream targets puma p rna sequencing revealed vast number differentially expressed genes suggesting pervasive effect drug combination transcription enrichment pathways involved dna damage response finally drug combination confirmed reduce tumor growth zebrafish xenograft experiments conclusion combination wip inhibitor sl epigenetic modifier gskj induces synergistic cytotoxicity neuroblastoma cells potentiating p downstream effects,AI in Oncology
"The Nottingham histologic grade is crucial for assessing severity and predicting prognosis in breast cancer, a prevalent cancer worldwide. Traditional grading systems rely on subjective expert judgment and require extensive pathological expertise, are time-consuming, and often lead to inter-observer variability. To address these limitations, we develop an AI-based model to predict Nottingham grade from whole-slide images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained breast cancer tissue using a pathology foundation model. From TCGA database, we trained and evaluated using 521 H&E breast cancer slide images with available Nottingham scores through internal split validation, and further validated its clinical utility using an additional set of 597 cases without Nottingham scores. The model leveraged deep features extracted from a pathology foundation model (UNI) and incorporated 14 distinct multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms. The best-performing model achieved an F1 score of 0.731 and a multiclass average AUC of 0.835. The top 300 genes correlated with model predictions were significantly enriched in pathways related to cell division and chromosome segregation, supporting the model's biological relevance. The predicted grades demonstrated statistically significant association with 5-year overall survival (p < 0.05).

"PD-L1, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and VEGFR2, essential for cancer metastasis, play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis. However, their miniature bispecific intracellular nanobodies for combining check-point blockade and anti-metastasis anticancer therapy remain underexplored. The intrabodies were developed using gene cloning technology. Specificity of the intrabodies was testified using Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis, antibody competitive binding assay, flow cytometry analysis, etc. Checkpoint blockade was demonstrated using antibody-antigen competitive binding assay. Cancer cell migration was determined using scratch assay. Combined anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy of FAP1V2 was determined in vivo of mice models. The PD-1<sup>hi</sup> immune cells, TCR β<sup>hi</sup> and CD25<sup>hi</sup> T-cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, and cancer cell metastasis was performed using immune-fluorescence analysis on lung and liver tissues. Transcriptome analysis was performed to explore signaling pathways associated with the enhanced anticancer efficiency. Bispecific intrabody FAP1V2 fused with antibody V<sub>H</sub> regions, was successfully developed and verified with its ability to target and block human and mouse PD-L1 and VEGFR2, inhibiting cancer cell binding to PD-1 and reducing their migratory capacity. Compared to the other treatment, two-rounds of transient FAP1V2 expression in LLC cells in experimental mice models achieved remarkable tumor inhibition, which brought about complete immune inhibition on growth of secondary-round of LLC tumor in 1/6 of the tested mice, inspired long-term activation of TCR β<sup>hi</sup> T cells and increased their infiltration to tumors, inhibited the emergence of PD-1<sup>hi</sup> immune cells, indicating prevented T cell depletion.

"As the most thoroughly studied epigenetic modification, DNA methylation-induced silencing of suppressor genes is closely related with the development of cancers. Bioinformatic analysis is an important research tool in the fields of life sciences, medicine, and so on. To introduce the application of bioinformatic analysis in cancer epigenetic research to students and to change the current situation that students usually passively perform experiments during the experimental teaching of genetics, we established a comprehensive and exploratory epigenetic experiment which was integrated with bioinformatic analysis. The implement of this experiment followed the principles of centering on students and cultivating scientific research capabilities. Students selected the genes that were potentially silenced by high DNA methylation in lung adenocarcinoma through bioinformatic analysis and literature review under the guidance of teachers and formulated experimental scheme by their own. They then conducted real-time PCR and methylation-specific PCR to explore whether DNA methylation caused the expression silencing of genes of interest and to identify the DNA methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of genes of interest. To comprehensively assess the capability of students, we designed diversified evaluation methods which intensify the assessment of experiment process.

"Reversible alterations at DNA sequence or epigenetic levels can result in phenotypes that are unstably inherited. The reversibility of these inheritable changes might be uniquely beneficial for adaption to possible fluctuations in environment. However, unstable changes are always ignored for the genetic instability in traditional studies, especially in the cause of drug resistance. In this study, we conduct a specific genetic screen in fission yeast using rapamycin (+caffeine) and obtain 173 resistant isolates. In contrast to the common strategy of isolating stable genetic mutants, we passage the cell culture with rapamycin resistance on drug free condition and test the resistance of offspring every five days, and obtain 14 strains that exhibit unstable resistance to rapamycin (the drug resistance is lost randomly among the cell progenies without drug selection pressure). Further studies show that the unstable genetic resistance of some strains is regulated by reversible DNA sequence alterationat the <i>ssp1</i> gene locus. This study provides new insights and relevant scientific basis for the regulatory mechanism of unstable drug resistance in the process of rapamycin as a clinical anti-tumor drug, and a new possible target for solving the problem of drug resistance.",Epigenetics,reversible alterations dna sequence epigenetic levels result phenotypes unstably inherited reversibility inheritable changes might uniquely beneficial adaption possible fluctuations environment however unstable changes always ignored genetic instability traditional studies especially cause drug resistance study conduct specific genetic screen fission yeast using rapamycin caffeine obtain resistant isolates contrast common strategy isolating stable genetic mutants passage cell culture rapamycin resistance drug free condition test resistance offspring every five days obtain strains exhibit unstable resistance rapamycin drug resistance lost randomly among cell progenies without drug selection pressure studies show unstable genetic resistance strains regulated reversible dna sequence alterationat isspi gene locus study provides new insights relevant scientific basis regulatory mechanism unstable drug resistance process rapamycin clinical antitumor drug new possible target solving problem drug resistance,Epigenetics
"YEATS2, an evolutionarily conserved reader of histone acylation marks (H3K27ac, H3K27cr, H3K27bz), functions as a central oncogenic driver in diverse cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its structurally plastic YEATS domain bridges acyl-CoA metabolism to chromatin remodeling, amplifying transcription of survival genes such as MYC, BCL2, and PD-L1. YEATS2 orchestrates malignancy-specific programs-sustaining ribosome biogenesis in NSCLC through ATAC complex recruitment, enhancing NF-κB-dependent immune evasion in PDAC, and activating PI3K/AKT-driven metabolic rewiring in HCC. Structural studies demonstrate a unique aromatic cage architecture that selectively engages diverse acylated histones. Although pyrazolopyridine-based inhibitors targeting the YEATS domain show preclinical efficacy, developing isoform-selective agents remains challenging. Clinically, YEATS2 overexpression correlates with therapy resistance and may synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. This review integrates mechanistic insights into the role of YEATS2 in epigenetic regulation, evaluates its therapeutic potential, and proposes future directions: elucidating full-length complex topologies, mapping synthetic lethal interactors, and optimizing selective inhibitors.

"The development of hematopoietic cell lineages is a highly complex process governed by a delicate interplay of various transcription factors. The expression of these factors is influenced, in part, by epigenetic signatures that define each stage of cell differentiation. In particular, the formation of B lymphocytes depends on the sequential silencing of stemness genes and the balanced expression of interdependent transcription factors, along with DNA rearrangement. We have investigated the impact of Dido3 deficiency, a protein involved in chromatin status readout, on B cell differentiation within the hematopoietic compartment of mice. Our findings revealed significant impairments in the successive stages of B cell development. The absence of Dido3 resulted in remarkable alterations in the expression of essential transcription factors and differentiation markers, which are crucial for orchestrating the differentiation process. Additionally, the somatic recombination process, responsible for generation of antigen receptor diversity, was also adversely affected. These observations highlight the vital role of epigenetic regulation, particularly the involvement of Dido3, in ensuring proper B cell differentiation. This study reveals new mechanisms underlying disruptive alterations, deepening our understanding of hematopoiesis and may potentially lead to insights that aid in the development of therapeutic interventions for disorders involving aberrant B cell development.",Epigenetics,development hematopoietic cell lineages highly complex process governed delicate interplay various transcription factors expression factors influenced part epigenetic signatures define stage cell differentiation particular formation b lymphocytes depends sequential silencing stemness genes balanced expression interdependent transcription factors along dna rearrangement investigated impact dido deficiency protein involved chromatin status readout b cell differentiation within hematopoietic compartment mice findings revealed significant impairments successive stages b cell development absence dido resulted remarkable alterations expression essential transcription factors differentiation markers crucial orchestrating differentiation process additionally somatic recombination process responsible generation antigen receptor diversity also adversely affected observations highlight vital role epigenetic regulation particularly involvement dido ensuring proper b cell differentiation study reveals new mechanisms underlying disruptive alterations deepening understanding hematopoiesis may potentially lead insights aid development therapeutic interventions disorders involving aberrant b cell development,Epigenetics
"Heterozygous histone H3.3K27M mutation is a primary oncogenic driver of Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG). H3.3K27M inhibits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase activity, leading to global reduction and redistribution of the repressive H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). This epigenomic rewiring is thought to promote gliomagenesis, but the precise role of K27M in gene regulation and tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. We established isogenic DMG patient-derived cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to create H3.3 wild-type (WT), H3.3K27M, and combinations with EZH2 and EZH1 co-deletion, thereby eliminating PRC2 function and H3K27me3. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis revealed that K27M exerts a novel epigenetic effect independent of PRC2 inhibition. While PRC2 loss led to widespread gene induction including HOX gene clusters, and activation of biological pathways, K27M induced a balanced gene deregulation with an overall repressive effect on pathway activity. Genes uniquely affected by K27M, independent of PRC2 loss, showed concordant changes in chromatin accessibility, with upregulated genes becoming more accessible. Importantly, xenografts of H3.3K27M/EZH1/2 WT cells formed tumors, whereas /EZH1/2 knockout cells did not, demonstrating a PRC2-independent role of K27M in tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal that the H3.3K27M mutation alters chromatin accessibility and uniquely deregulates gene expression independent of H3K27 methylation loss.

"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1) gene. Healthy individuals possess a repeat 30-55 CGG units in length. Once the CGG repeat exceeds 200 copies it triggers methylation at the locus. This methylation covers the FMR1 promoter region and silences expression of the gene and the production of FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). The loss of FMRP is responsible for a number of pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Methylation of the expanded repeat in the FMR1 locus is the causal factor for FXS, however it is not known why the expanded repeat triggers this epigenetic change or how exactly DNA methylation is established. Intriguingly, genetic engineering of expanded CGG repeats of over 300 copies in the FMR1 locus in mice remains unmethylated. Also in humans, in very rare cases, individuals can have an FMR1 CGG expansion > 200 copies but the locus remains unmethylated. These unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals give us a rare opportunity to investigate the mechanism of FMR1 promoter methylation. Fibroblasts were obtained from a healthy control, an FXS patient and two unmethylated full expansion carriers. RNA was extracted and comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on all samples. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on DNA from the two UFM carriers and the results analysed to investigate DNA variants that could explain the observed differences in gene expression. Our analyses focused on genes involved in epigenetic modification. We show that Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), a gene involved in DNA methylation, is significantly downregulated in UFM carriers compared to healthy controls or FXS patient derived cells. Genomic analyses reveal a number of rare variants present in the TET3 locus in UFM carriers when compared to the reference genome. However, no clear modifying TET3 variants were identified. Our results suggest that TET3 is a candidate factor responsible for the lack of methylation of the expanded FMR1 locus. Further analyses are needed to further elucidate this relationship, however given its potential to directly interact with CGG repeats and its ambiguous role in 5-hydroxy-methylation of CG containing sequences, TET3 is a strong candidate for further exploration.",Epigenetics,fragile x syndrome fxs neurodevelopmental disorder caused expansion cgg repeat utr fmr fragile x messenger ribonucleoprotein gene healthy individuals possess repeat cgg units length cgg repeat exceeds copies triggers methylation locus methylation covers fmr promoter region silences expression gene production fmrp fragile x messenger ribonucleoprotein loss fmrp responsible number pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay autism spectrum disorder methylation expanded repeat fmr locus causal factor fxs however known expanded repeat triggers epigenetic change exactly dna methylation established intriguingly genetic engineering expanded cgg repeats copies fmr locus mice remains unmethylated also humans rare cases individuals fmr cgg expansion copies locus remains unmethylated unmethylated full mutation ufm individuals give us rare opportunity investigate mechanism fmr promoter methylation fibroblasts obtained healthy control fxs patient two unmethylated full expansion carriers rna extracted comparative transcriptomic analysis performed samples whole genome sequencing carried dna two ufm carriers results analysed investigate dna variants could explain observed differences gene expression analyses focused genes involved epigenetic modification show tet methylcytosine dioxygenase tet gene involved dna methylation significantly downregulated ufm carriers compared healthy controls fxs patient derived cells genomic analyses reveal number rare variants present tet locus ufm carriers compared reference genome however clear modifying tet variants identified results suggest tet candidate factor responsible lack methylation expanded fmr locus analyses needed elucidate relationship however given potential directly interact cgg repeats ambiguous role hydroxymethylation cg containing sequences tet strong candidate exploration,Epigenetics
"One of the main characteristics of tumor metabolite reprogramming is enhanced glycolysis, and Pyruvate Kinase M2(PKM2) is a crucial enzyme that limits the pace of glycometabolism. Although PKM2 has been proven to affect the development of some cancers, a pan-cancer analysis of PKM2 has not yet been performed. We analyzed the expression and prognosis of PKM2 in pan-cancer using multiple databases. We performed epigenetic, functional enrichment, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity analyses of PKM2. PKM2 was found to be significantly upregulated in most malignancies and associated with a bad prognosis. In some cancers, the PKM2 DNA promoter was hypomethylated. The expression of PKM2 was positively linked with most m6A-methylation-related genes in pan-cancer. The functions of PKM2 were primarily associated with the regulation of the immune system, glycolysis, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PKM2 was favorably associated with neutrophils and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment of most cancers. Importantly, PKM2 showed a strikingly high correlation with CD274 (PD-L1), CD276, TGF-β1, VEGFA, and HAVCR2 in most cancers. Finally, using experiments, it was confirmed that silencing PKM2 could increase the sensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to cisplatin by regulating autophagy.

"Changes in the proteome and its dysregulation have long been known to be a hallmark of aging. We derived a proteomic aging trait using data on 1459 plasma proteins from 44,435 UK Biobank individuals measured using an antibody-based assay. This metric is strongly associated with four age-related disease outcomes, even after adjusting for chronological age. Survival analysis showed that one-year older proteomic age, relative to chronological age, increases all-cause mortality hazard by 13 percent. We performed a genome-wide association analysis of proteomic age acceleration (proteomic aging trait minus chronological age) to identify its biological determinants. Proteomic age acceleration showed modest genetic correlations with four epigenetic clocks (R<sub>g</sub> = 0.17 to 0.19) and telomere length (R<sub>g</sub> = -0.2). Once we removed associations that were explained by a single pQTL, we were left with three signals mapping to BRCA1, POLR2A and TET2 with apparent widespread effects on plasma proteomic aging. Genetic variation at these three loci has been shown to affect other omics-related aging measures. Mendelian randomisation analyses showed causal effects of higher BMI and type 2 diabetes on faster proteomic age acceleration. This supports the idea that obesity and other features of metabolic syndrome have an adverse effect on the processes of human aging.",Epigenetics,changes proteome dysregulation long known hallmark aging derived proteomic aging trait using data plasma proteins uk biobank individuals measured using antibodybased assay metric strongly associated four agerelated disease outcomes even adjusting chronological age survival analysis showed oneyear older proteomic age relative chronological age increases allcause mortality hazard percent performed genomewide association analysis proteomic age acceleration proteomic aging trait minus chronological age identify biological determinants proteomic age acceleration showed modest genetic correlations four epigenetic clocks rsubgsub telomere length rsubgsub removed associations explained single pqtl left three signals mapping brca polra tet apparent widespread effects plasma proteomic aging genetic variation three loci shown affect omicsrelated aging measures mendelian randomisation analyses showed causal effects higher bmi type diabetes faster proteomic age acceleration supports idea obesity features metabolic syndrome adverse effect processes human aging,Epigenetics
"Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), shows promise in the treatment of breast cancer (BC); however, drug resistance limits its clinical application. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), which is overexpressed in many tumor types, plays a key role in tumor metastasis and drug resistance. The involvement of MMP1 in SG resistance in metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR + ) BC has not been previously reported. In this study, we employed various in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of MMP1 in SG resistance in BC. MMP1 expression was manipulated in different BC cell lines through lentiviral transfection and small interfering RNA techniques. Key methodologies included Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and RNA sequencing to assess marker expression and identify differentially expressed genes. Functional assays were conducted to evaluate cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration. In vivo, a cell-derived xenograft model in nude mice was utilized to assess tumor growth and drug response. Bioinformatics analyses further explored MMP1 expression and its clinical relevance across different cancer types. Our findings indicate that MMP1 is overexpressed by approximately 30-fold in HR + BC tissues and is associated with poorer prognosis among HR + BC patients. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that HR + BC with high MMP1 expression displays resistance to SG, supporting the hypothesis that MMP1 plays a key role in regulating ADC resistance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MMP1 can activate the NF-κB pathway, which subsequently influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to SG resistance. Ultimately, our research underscores the potential of MMP1 as a therapeutic target and biomarker, facilitating personalized treatment strategies that could enhance patient outcomes in BC therapy.",Epigenetics,sacituzumab govitecan sg novel antibodydrug conjugate adc shows promise treatment breast cancer bc however drug resistance limits clinical application matrix metalloproteinase mmp overexpressed many tumor types plays key role tumor metastasis drug resistance involvement mmp sg resistance metastatic hormone receptorpositive hr bc previously reported study employed various vitro vivo approaches investigate role mmp sg resistance bc mmp expression manipulated different bc cell lines lentiviral transfection small interfering rna techniques key methodologies included western blot quantitative reverse transcription pcr rna sequencing assess marker expression identify differentially expressed genes functional assays conducted evaluate cell viability proliferation invasion migration vivo cellderived xenograft model nude mice utilized assess tumor growth drug response bioinformatics analyses explored mmp expression clinical relevance across different cancer types findings indicate mmp overexpressed approximately fold hr bc tissues associated poorer prognosis among hr bc patients furthermore analysis reveals hr bc high mmp expression displays resistance sg supporting hypothesis mmp plays key role regulating adc resistance mechanistic studies demonstrate mmp activate nfb pathway subsequently influences epithelialmesenchymal transition thereby contributing sg resistance ultimately research underscores potential mmp therapeutic target biomarker facilitating personalized treatment strategies could enhance patient outcomes bc therapy,Epigenetics
"Metastasis is a lethal disease of cancer, spreading from primary tumors to the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which disseminate to distant organs at low efficiency for secondary tumor regeneration, thereby contributing to unfavorable patient outcomes. The detection of dynamic CTC alterations can be indicative of cancer progression (residual cancer, aggressiveness, therapy resistance) or regression (therapy response), serving as biomarkers for diagnoses and prognoses. CTC heterogeneity is impacted by both intrinsic oncogenic changes and extrinsic microenvironmental factors (e.g. the immune system and circadian rhythm), altering the genomic/genetic, epigenomic/epigenetic, proteomic, post-translational, and metabolomic landscapes. In addition to homeostatic dynamics, regenerative stemness, and metabolic plasticity, a newly discovered feature of CTCs that influences metastatic outcomes is its intercellular clustering. While the dogma suggests that CTCs play solo as single cells in the circulation, CTCs can orchestrate with other CTCs or white blood cells to form homotypic or heterotypic multi-cellular clusters, with 20-100 times enhanced metastatic potential than single CTCs. CTC clusters promote cell survival and stemness through DNA hypomethylation and signaling pathways activated by clustering-driving proteins (CD44, CD81, ICAM1, Podocalyxin, etc). Heterotypic CTC clusters may protect CTCs from immune cell attacks if not being cleared by cytotoxic immune cells. This chapter mainly focused on CTC biology related to multi-omic features and metastatic outcomes. We speculate that CTCs could guide therapeutic targeting and be targeted specifically by anti-CTC therapeutics to reduce or eliminate cancer and cancer metastasis.",Epigenetics,metastasis lethal disease cancer spreading primary tumors bloodstream circulating tumor cells ctcs disseminate distant organs low efficiency secondary tumor regeneration thereby contributing unfavorable patient outcomes detection dynamic ctc alterations indicative cancer progression residual cancer aggressiveness therapy resistance regression therapy response serving biomarkers diagnoses prognoses ctc heterogeneity impacted intrinsic oncogenic changes extrinsic microenvironmental factors eg immune system circadian rhythm altering genomicgenetic epigenomicepigenetic proteomic posttranslational metabolomic landscapes addition homeostatic dynamics regenerative stemness metabolic plasticity newly discovered feature ctcs influences metastatic outcomes intercellular clustering dogma suggests ctcs play solo single cells circulation ctcs orchestrate ctcs white blood cells form homotypic heterotypic multicellular clusters times enhanced metastatic potential single ctcs ctc clusters promote cell survival stemness dna hypomethylation signaling pathways activated clusteringdriving proteins cd cd icam podocalyxin etc heterotypic ctc clusters may protect ctcs immune cell attacks cleared cytotoxic immune cells chapter mainly focused ctc biology related multiomic features metastatic outcomes speculate ctcs could guide therapeutic targeting targeted specifically antictc therapeutics reduce eliminate cancer cancer metastasis,Epigenetics
"DNA methylation is one of the best-known epigenetic markers and plays a critical role in the control of gene activity and the architecture of the nucleus of the cell. Epigenetic alterations and especially DNA methylation have a high potential to provide valuable and innovative cancer biomarkers. Liquid biopsy is a unique minimally invasive tool for the management of cancer patients based on the extraction of information through detailed molecular analysis of circulating genetic material in peripheral blood and allows us to characterize the evolution of a solid tumor in real time. DNA methylation in combination with liquid biopsy is very powerful when it comes to providing circulating epigenetic biomarkers of clinical importance. Numerous DNA methylation markers are now being tested in liquid biopsies as potential biomarkers in various types of cancer. DNA methylation is mostly being studied in ctDNA but there are also a small number of studies up to now performed in gDNA isolated from CTCs. A highly important dimension of the combination of liquid biopsy/DNA methylation analysis is its high potential for early cancer detection since alterations in DNA methylation in plasma can be detected very early during cancer pathogenesis. Methylated DNA, modified nucleosomes and noncoding RNAs can be used as blood circulating epigenetic biomarkers for real-time and minimally-invasive cancer monitoring. DNA methylation is very promising and powerful in providing novel biomarkers for improving cancer diagnostics, while another important dimension in this field is the use of DNA methylation inhibitors in cancer treatment.

"Circulating tumor cells (CTC), released by primary tumors into the bloodstream, represent a valuable source to inform on cancer heterogeneity, cancer progression, metastatic disease and therapy efficacy without the need of invasive tumor biopsies. However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype. Despite technical and conceptual issues, tracking circulating CSCs has the potential to improve the prognostic/predictive value of CTCs in NSCLC setting and could provide novel insights into the comprehension of the metastatic process and identification of novel therapeutic targets.",Epigenetics,circulating tumor cells ctc released primary tumors bloodstream represent valuable source inform cancer heterogeneity cancer progression metastatic disease therapy efficacy without need invasive tumor biopsies however extreme rarity heterogeneity ctcs occurring genotypic phenotypic functional levels poses major challenge study population explains lack standardized strategies ctc isolation lung cancer leading causes cancerrelated death worldwide paradigmatic example ctc heterogeneity undermine clinical utility biomarker since contrasting data reported using different isolation technologies evidences suggest fraction ctc characterized stemlike feature partial epithelialmesenchymal transition emt phenotype sustain metastasis initiation cancer stem cells cscs potential maintain primary tumors initiate metastasis escape chemotherapy immunotherapy treatments moreover close connection reported several tumor types among hybrid phenotype characterized retention epithelial mesenchymal traits acquisition csc feature increased metastatic potential review focuses phenotypic functional heterogeneity ctcs resulting implications isolation clinical validation especially setting nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc particular discuss relevant studies providing evidence presence prognosticpredictive value ctc subsets characterized stemlike hybrid emt phenotype despite technical conceptual issues tracking circulating cscs potential improve prognosticpredictive value ctcs nsclc setting could provide novel insights comprehension metastatic process identification novel therapeutic targets,Epigenetics
"Adenomyosis, a menstruation-related uterine disorder, refers to the presence of endometrial stroma and glands within the myometrium and is typically observed in reproductive-age women. The pathogenesis explaining the migration, persistence, proliferation and differentiation of ectopic endometrial cells includes a genetic and epigenetic background, an oestrogen/progesterone receptor imbalance and an inflammatory reaction driven by local immune dysfunction, along with fibrosis and neuroangiogenesis within the myometrium. In the past, it was thought that adenomyosis almost exclusively affected multiparous women after 40 years of age and the diagnosis was generally confirmed upon hysterectomy. Nowadays, using imaging techniques such as transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, adenomyosis is increasingly identified in young women with dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, abnormal uterine bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding, and also in infertile patients. Furthermore, adenomyosis often coexists with other gynaecological conditions, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Despite the improvement of non-invasive diagnostic tools, the awareness of the condition is still poor and the diagnosis is often missed, due also to a heterogeneity in clinical presentation and imaging criteria. In addition, medical and surgical management do not follow shared recommendations, even though adenomyosis requires a lifelong management plan, including pain and bleeding control, fertility preservation and pregnancy complications.",Epigenetics,adenomyosis menstruationrelated uterine disorder refers presence endometrial stroma glands within myometrium typically observed reproductiveage women pathogenesis explaining migration persistence proliferation differentiation ectopic endometrial cells includes genetic epigenetic background oestrogenprogesterone receptor imbalance inflammatory reaction driven local immune dysfunction along fibrosis neuroangiogenesis within myometrium past thought adenomyosis almost exclusively affected multiparous women years age diagnosis generally confirmed upon hysterectomy nowadays using imaging techniques transvaginal ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging adenomyosis increasingly identified young women dysmenorrhoea dyspareunia abnormal uterine bleeding heavy menstrual bleeding also infertile patients furthermore adenomyosis often coexists gynaecological conditions endometriosis uterine fibroids despite improvement noninvasive diagnostic tools awareness condition still poor diagnosis often missed due also heterogeneity clinical presentation imaging criteria addition medical surgical management follow shared recommendations even though adenomyosis requires lifelong management plan including pain bleeding control fertility preservation pregnancy complications,Epigenetics
"Methylation levels of core histones play important roles in the regulation of gene expression and impact animal development. However, the methyltransferases and demethylases that determine histone methylation levels remain largely unexplored in insects. Most of our current understanding of histone methylation comes from mammalian studies. In this study, we first identified potential histone methyltransferases and demethylases encoded in the genome of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. The function of these histone methylation enzymes in the metamorphosis was investigated by knocking down genes coding for these enzymes using RNA interference (RNAi). Our results showed that a lysine methyltransferase, KMT5A, plays a critical role in T. castaneum metamorphosis by regulating the biosynthesis of ecdysteroids. Treating KMT5A-knockdown larvae with 20 hydroxyecdysone can partially rescue T. castaneum pupation. Western blot analysis showed that KMT5A catalyzes H4K20 mono-methylation. However, further studies suggest that KMT5A may regulate T. castaneum pupation through mechanisms independent of H4K20 methylation. These data uncovered the roles of histone methylation enzymes in T. castaneum metamorphosis and KMT5A as a critical regulator of ecdysteroid biosynthesis.",Epigenetics,methylation levels core histones play important roles regulation gene expression impact animal development however methyltransferases demethylases determine histone methylation levels remain largely unexplored insects current understanding histone methylation comes mammalian studies study first identified potential histone methyltransferases demethylases encoded genome red flour beetle tribolium castaneum function histone methylation enzymes metamorphosis investigated knocking genes coding enzymes using rna interference rnai results showed lysine methyltransferase kmta plays critical role castaneum metamorphosis regulating biosynthesis ecdysteroids treating kmtaknockdown larvae hydroxyecdysone partially rescue castaneum pupation western blot analysis showed kmta catalyzes hk monomethylation however studies suggest kmta may regulate castaneum pupation mechanisms independent hk methylation data uncovered roles histone methylation enzymes castaneum metamorphosis kmta critical regulator ecdysteroid biosynthesis,Epigenetics

"N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) plays a crucial role in kidney diseases. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) as a key m<sup>6</sup>A writer can be regulated by trametinib. However, the epigenetic regulation of trametinib in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remains unclear. We investigated whether trametinib protects podocytes by modulating METTL3-methylated target RNAs. Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) was predicted as a target binding RNA of METTL3 by THEW database. Immunostaining of METTL3 and RCAN1 with podocyte marker Wilm's tumor-1 (WT-1) confirmed their localization within podocytes in renal biopsy from FSGS patients. Transfection METTL3 to human podocytes reduced WT-1, synaptopodin (SYNPO), and RCAN1 protein levels.

"This study aimed to examine the associations between the frailty index and four epigenetic aging acceleration (EAA) estimators in cross-sectional and longitudinal settings. The frailty index in the older adults was measured according to a cumulative health-deficit model. Four different epigenetic age measures (Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPoAm38) were regressed against chronological age, and the resulting standardized residuals were indicative of EAA. The longitudinal relationship between EAA at baseline and changes in the frailty index during the 4-year follow-up were examined using a mixed linear model. A single standard deviation (SD) increment in the frailty index was associated with a faster EAA, as indicated by the four clocks in Hannum (b = 0.057; P = 0.015), PhenoAge (b = 0.096; P < 0.001), GrimAge (b = 0.120; P < 0.001), and DunedinPoAm38 (b = 0.062; P = 0.002) in the fully adjusted model.

Here, we examine the DNAm patterns specific to immune cell types and inflammation in those with PTSD. This study includes 3,277 participants from 11 cohorts participating in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) PTSD Epigenetics Workgroup. DNAm was assayed from blood with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip. A standardized QC pipeline was applied and used to impute cell composition. Within each cohort, we identified cell-type-specific DNAm patterns associated with PTSD, controlling for sex (if applicable), age, and ancestry. Meta-analyses were performed from summary statistics. PTSD cases had lower proportions of B cells and NK cells as well as higher proportions of neutrophils when compared to trauma-exposed controls. Overall, we identified 96 PTSD-associated CpGs across six types of immune cells. Most of these differences were identified in B cells, with 95 % exhibiting lower methylation levels in those with PTSD. Interestingly, the PTSD-associated CpGs annotated to a gene in B cells were enriched in a recent GWAS of PTSD (p < 0.0001).

"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a predominant immunosuppressive cell type within the tumor microenvironment. Whether polysaccharides from Sargassum henslowianum C. Ag. (SH) exert anti-tumor effects by modulating TAMs remains under investigation. In this study, we isolated and characterized a uniform sulfated polysaccharide, SHA1P-2, from SH, with a molecular weight of 68,000 g/mol. Monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that fucose and galactose were the predominant components, with minor amounts of xylose and mannose. RM1-Raw264.7 cells, simulating TAMs, were induced by culturing Raw264.7 cells in the supernatant of prostate cancer RM1 cells, and their effects on T-cell proliferation were assessed. Unlike Raw264.7 cells, RM1-Raw264.7 cells significantly suppressed concanavalin A-induced T-cell proliferation, a suppression alleviated by SHA1P-2 treatment. Interestingly, SHA1P-2 did not induce apoptosis in Raw264.7 cells but effectively triggered apoptosis in RM1-Raw264.7 cells. The apoptotic mechanism was mediated via the upregulation of CD206 in TAMs, as evidenced by reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when CD206 was knocked down or p-ERK was inhibited in TAMs. These findings demonstrate that SHA1P-2 promotes TAM apoptosis via the CD206-ERK-ROS axis, indicating that elevated ROS levels serve as a key trigger for TAM apoptosis, thereby presenting a novel strategy for TAM-based anti-tumor therapies.",Epigenetics,tumorassociated macrophages tams predominant immunosuppressive cell type within tumor microenvironment whether polysaccharides sargassum henslowianum c ag sh exert antitumor effects modulating tams remains investigation study isolated characterized uniform sulfated polysaccharide shap sh molecular weight gmol monosaccharide composition analysis revealed fucose galactose predominant components minor amounts xylose mannose rmraw cells simulating tams induced culturing raw cells supernatant prostate cancer rm cells effects tcell proliferation assessed unlike raw cells rmraw cells significantly suppressed concanavalin ainduced tcell proliferation suppression alleviated shap treatment interestingly shap induce apoptosis raw cells effectively triggered apoptosis rmraw cells apoptotic mechanism mediated via upregulation cd tams evidenced reduced apoptosis reactive oxygen species ros levels cd knocked perk inhibited tams findings demonstrate shap promotes tam apoptosis via cderkros axis indicating elevated ros levels serve key trigger tam apoptosis thereby presenting novel strategy tambased antitumor therapies,Epigenetics
"Depression during pregnancy and postpartum poses significant risks to both maternal and child well-being. The underlying biological mechanisms are unclear, but epigenetic variation could be exploited as a plausible candidate for early detection. We investigated whether DNA methylation signatures are associated with antenatal depressive symptoms (ADS) and whether early alterations in methylation patterns could be used to predict postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS). 201 pregnant women in early pregnancy, without a prior history of depression disorders, from the STratification of Risk of Diabetes in Early Pregnancy study were recruited. Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 92 women were identified with ADS, while 109 served as controls. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess PDS during 6-12 weeks after delivery. The dataset was split into 80 % for training and testing and 20 % for validation, to discern potential CpGs for ADS using a support vector machine classifier. Analysis revealed 591 CpGs significantly associated with ADS, from which a panel of 7 CpGs was identified to discriminate between ADS and controls with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC: 0.85 in test, 0.73 in validation). Pathway analysis highlighted involvement in inositol phosphate metabolism, notch, and calcium signaling. The same 7 CpGs predicted PDS with an AUC of 0.76 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.87). Integration of CpG data with patient-reported information significantly enhanced PDS prediction. Our study identified DNA methylation signatures that could potentially differentiate ADS from controls and predict PDS.

"Epigenetics describes itself as heritable modifications in gene function that eventually alter gene and protein expression levels without any alterations in the genome sequence. Epigenetic alterations are closely association with several neurological diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. In recent years, growing shreds of evidences suggested the crucial role of epigenetic modifications especially histone modifications in environmental toxicants-induced neurotoxicity. This review will give an overview of the state of knowledge on histone alterations and the ways in which environmental pollutants bisphenol-A, heavy metals, pesticides, and phthalates affects post-translational modifications to alter gene transcription and cause neurological abnormalities. We provide a brief summary of the results of recent research on the effects of environmental toxins on each of the prior identified processes of histone modifications, including the neurological consequences and changes in histones.

"With continuous advances in DNA sequencing methods, accessibility to high-quality genomic information for all living organisms is ever increasing. However, to interpret this information effectively and formulate hypotheses, users often require higher level programming skills. Therefore, the generation of web-based tools is becoming increasingly popular. CpG island regions in genomes are often found in gene promoters and are prone to DNA methylation; with their methylation status determining if a gene is expressed. Notably, understanding the biological impact of CpX modifications on genomic regulation is becoming increasingly important as these modifications have been associated with diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. However, there is currently no easy-to-use scalable tool to detect and quantify CpX islands in full genomes. We have developed a Java-based web server for CpX island analyses that benefits from the DNA Analyzer Web server environment and overcomes several limitations. For a pilot demonstration study, we selected a well-described model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Subsequent analysis of obtained CpX islands revealed several interesting and previously undescribed phenomena. One of them is the fact, that nearly half of long CpG islands were located on chromosome X, and that long CpA and CpT islands were significantly overrepresented at the subcentromeric regions of autosomes (chr2 and chr3) and also on chromosome Y. Wide genome overlays of predicted CpX islands revealed their co-occurrence with various (epi)genomics features comprising cytosine methylations, accessible chromatin, transposable elements, or binding of transcription factors and other proteins.

"Cancer neuroscience, a burgeoning field, investigates the complex interactions between cancer and the nervous system, emphasizing how cancer cells exploit neuronal components for growth and metastasis. Tumor-associated Schwann cells (TASc) have emerged as crucial players in the progression of highly innervated cancers, highlighting the intricate relationship between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the nervous system. This review concludes how TASc, as the most abundant glial cell in the peripheral nervous system, contribute to tumor growth, metastasis, and the remodeling of the TME. Acting similarly to reactive astrocytes in the central nervous system, TASc are implicated in driving perineural invasion (PNI), a distinctive cancer progression pathway facilitating tumor infiltration and metastasis. These TASc not only contribute indirectly to pain but also promote tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Intrinsic to their role, TASc exhibit unique gene expression profiles and phenotypic transformations, shifting from myelinating to non-myelinating states, thereby actively participating in metastasis and the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Targeting TASc represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy in non-neurological cancers, offering new avenues for clinical intervention.",Epigenetics,cancer neuroscience burgeoning field investigates complex interactions cancer nervous system emphasizing cancer cells exploit neuronal components growth metastasis tumorassociated schwann cells tasc emerged crucial players progression highly innervated cancers highlighting intricate relationship tumor microenvironment tme nervous system review concludes tasc abundant glial cell peripheral nervous system contribute tumor growth metastasis remodeling tme acting similarly reactive astrocytes central nervous system tasc implicated driving perineural invasion pni distinctive cancer progression pathway facilitating tumor infiltration metastasis tasc contribute indirectly pain also promote tumor recurrence poor prognosis intrinsic role tasc exhibit unique gene expression profiles phenotypic transformations shifting myelinating nonmyelinating states thereby actively participating metastasis remodeling tumor microenvironment targeting tasc represents novel promising therapeutic strategy nonneurological cancers offering new avenues clinical intervention,Epigenetics
"This review is centered around the cardiotoxic effects of fumonisin B1 (FB1), particularly its impact on sphingolipid metabolism, inflammation, and epigenetics. FB1 is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium fungi, which mainly contaminates cereal grains and poses an adverse health risk to both humans and animals; however, its disease-causing capabilities remain to be uncovered, specifically its ability to exacerbate and cause cardiovascular disease. It disrupts sphingolipid metabolism by inhibiting ceramide synthase, leading to cellular dysfunction and contributes to conditions such as hypertension and eventual heart failure. FB1 is responsible for an altered inflammatory response, whereby it increases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β, which contribute to cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, FB1 induces significant epigenetic changes, including DNA hypermethylation, histone modifications such as increased H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, inhibition of histone acetyltransferase activity, and changes in microRNA expression profiles. These epigenetic alterations can silence or activate inflammatory genes, exacerbating disease progression. This review thus highlights the need for further research to elucidate the connections between FB1, inflammation, epigenetic modifications, and cardiotoxicity, which could lead to better strategies for managing FB1-related adverse health risks.",Epigenetics,review centered around cardiotoxic effects fumonisin b fb particularly impact sphingolipid metabolism inflammation epigenetics fb mycotoxin produced fusarium fungi mainly contaminates cereal grains poses adverse health risk humans animals however diseasecausing capabilities remain uncovered specifically ability exacerbate cause cardiovascular disease disrupts sphingolipid metabolism inhibiting ceramide synthase leading cellular dysfunction contributes conditions hypertension eventual heart failure fb responsible altered inflammatory response whereby increases proinflammatory cytokines il il contribute cardiovascular diseases moreover fb induces significant epigenetic changes including dna hypermethylation histone modifications increased hkme hkme inhibition histone acetyltransferase activity changes microrna expression profiles epigenetic alterations silence activate inflammatory genes exacerbating disease progression review thus highlights need research elucidate connections fb inflammation epigenetic modifications cardiotoxicity could lead better strategies managing fbrelated adverse health risks,Epigenetics
"Sunitinib resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized axis involving Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) and coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) that drives chemoresistance through modulation of Akt signaling. Mechanistically, TRIB3 directly interacts with CARM1, a pro-survival epigenetic regulator, and inhibits its ubiquitination to stabilize CARM1 protein levels. Elevated CARM1 further exacerbates therapeutic resistance, establishing a feedforward loop that sustains Akt activation.

"Telomeres are essential nucleoprotein structures that preserve our terminal DNA sequence and protect chromosome ends from fusion. Our vast knowledge of telomeres comes almost entirely from studies of healthy and diseased somatic cells. However, building evidence suggests that the molecules and mechanisms required for telomere integrity in somatic cells are insufficient to preserve telomere integrity during the sperm-to-embryo transition. Here, we review this growing body of work on telomere 'paternal effects', wherein zygotic telomere integrity is determined not by the genotype of the zygote but instead by the genotype of the father. Direct inheritance of sperm-specific proteins establishes paternal telomere epigenetic identity, while direct inheritance of sperm telomere length contributes to telomere length inheritance. Together, these investigations of telomere integrity through the sperm-to-embryo transition reveal potent paternal effects on zygotic telomere functions, with implications for human infertility.",Epigenetics,telomeres essential nucleoprotein structures preserve terminal dna sequence protect chromosome ends fusion vast knowledge telomeres comes almost entirely studies healthy diseased somatic cells however building evidence suggests molecules mechanisms required telomere integrity somatic cells insufficient preserve telomere integrity spermtoembryo transition review growing body work telomere paternal effects wherein zygotic telomere integrity determined genotype zygote instead genotype father direct inheritance spermspecific proteins establishes paternal telomere epigenetic identity direct inheritance sperm telomere length contributes telomere length inheritance together investigations telomere integrity spermtoembryo transition reveal potent paternal effects zygotic telomere functions implications human infertility,Epigenetics
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with dysfunction in the cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological systems. However, the relationship between OSA and memory impairment, intervention effects, and underlying pathways are not well understood. This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical characterization, treatment strategies, and mechanisms of OSA-induced memory impairments. OSA patients may exhibit significant memory declines, including impairments in working memory from visual and verbal sources. The underlying mechanisms behind OSA-related memory impairment are complex and multifactorial with poorly understood aspects that require further investigation. Neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal damage, synaptic plasticity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, as observed under exposures to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation are likely contributors to learning and memory dysfunction. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment can provide remarkable relief from memory impairment in OSA patients. Other treatments are emerging but need to be rigorously evaluated for cognitive improvement. Clinically, reliable and objective diagnostic tools are necessary for accurate diagnosis and clinical characterization of cognitive impairments in OSA patients.

"Pesticides and trace element exposure can cause serious health outcomes. Brazil is a leading agrochemical user(kg/ha). This study aimed to assess DNA damage and epigenetic alterations due to agrochemical exposure in farmers from southern Brazil. One hundred and twelve farmers (male and female) with different exposure to agrochemicals were studied: group 1, farmers who handled agrochemicals extensively during the month of sample collection (n=44), and group 2 (n=68), who did not. Lifestyle and occupational information questionnaires were applied. Biomonitoring was performed by evaluating cholinesterase activity, trace element levels in blood, buccal micronucleus cytome assay (BMCyt) in buccal cells, telomere lenght and epigenetic alterations. Cholinesterase activity showed no significant difference between groups. Blood trace elements such as As, Cr, Ni and V were above reference values, indicating excessive exposure. Strong correlations between trace elements suggested a common source of exposure. Group 1 had higher frequencies of micronuclei, nuclear buds, binucleated, and cell alterations, biomerkers for DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Global DNA methylation was higher in group 1 and correlated with Cr, Ni and Be. Telomere length was negatively correlated with age, Cr and Ni. Farmers exhibited mutagenicity, telomere lenght and epigenetic alteration associeated with exposure to toxic trace elements, including important carcinogens. Moreover, the results demonstrated the importance of quantified trace elements as exposure biomarkers and the BMCyt assay, as a biomonitoring tool to evaluate agrochemical exposure.

"The histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase KMT2D (also called MLL4) is one of the most frequently mutated epigenetic modifiers in many cancers, including medulloblastoma (MB). Notably, heterozygous KMT2D loss frequently occurs in MB and other cancers. However, its oncogenic role remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that heterozygous Kmt2d loss in murine cerebellar regions promotes MB genesis driven by heterozygous loss of the MB-suppressor gene Ptch via the upregulation of tumor-promoting programs (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]). Downregulation of the transcription-repressive tumor suppressor NCOR2 by heterozygous Kmt2d loss, along with Ptch<sup>+/-</sup>-increased MYCN, upregulated tumor-promoting genes. Heterozygous Kmt2d loss substantially diminished enhancer marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) and the H3K4me3 signature, including those for Ncor2. Combinatory pharmacological inhibition of the enhancer-decommissioning H3K4 demethylase LSD1 and OXPHOS significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of MB cells bearing heterozygous Kmt2d loss.

"Microplastics (MPs), ubiquitous environmental pollutants, pose substantial threats to aquatic ecosystems and organisms, including the model species <i>Daphnia magna</i>. This study examined the effects of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) MPs on <i>D. magna</i>, focusing on their ingestion, epigenetic alterations, and transcriptional responses. Exposure experiments revealed a concentration-dependent accumulation of MPs, with PS particles showing higher ingestion rates due to their higher density and propensity for aggregation. Epigenetic analyses demonstrated that exposure to PE MPs significantly reduced the global DNA methylation (5-mC) of <i>Daphnia magna</i>, suggesting hypomethylation as a potential stress response. Conversely, the DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hmC) of <i>Daphnia magna</i> displayed variability under PS exposure.

"Early embryonic development is controlled by maternal factors originating from mature oocytes. The zygotic genome is activated from a transcriptionally quiescent state through a process called embryonic genome activation (EGA), which involves the depletion and clearance of maternal factors. However, the mechanism by which maternal factors regulate EGA and embryonic development, particularly in humans, remains elusive. In this study, using tri-pronuclear (3PN) embryos and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we demonstrated that the maternal transcription factor Orthodenticle Homeobox 2 (OTX2), a paired-like homeobox gene, promotes EGA in human pre-implantation embryos. Knockdown of OTX2 through Trim-Away technology blocked embryonic development and minor EGA gene expression. Overexpression of OTX2 (OTX2<sup>OE</sup>) in hESCs increased transcript products, primarily at the 2-cell embryo stage genes, including genes encoding methyltransferase of histone H3K4. OTX2<sup>OE</sup> increased the level of H3K4me3 and increased the open chromatin region that co-occurs with the H3K4me3 region at the 4-cell stage in hESCs. Based on these findings in hESCs, we further verified that OTX2 directly induced the expression of SETD1A by binding to its promoter, leading to increased H3K4me3 levels in both hESCs and 3PN embryos. These findings suggest that the maternal transcription factor OTX2 regulates EGA and early embryogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms.",Epigenetics,early embryonic development controlled maternal factors originating mature oocytes zygotic genome activated transcriptionally quiescent state process called embryonic genome activation ega involves depletion clearance maternal factors however mechanism maternal factors regulate ega embryonic development particularly humans remains elusive study using tripronuclear pn embryos human embryonic stem cells hescs demonstrated maternal transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox otx pairedlike homeobox gene promotes ega human preimplantation embryos knockdown otx trimaway technology blocked embryonic development minor ega gene expression overexpression otx otxsupoesup hescs increased transcript products primarily cell embryo stage genes including genes encoding methyltransferase histone hk otxsupoesup increased level hkme increased open chromatin region cooccurs hkme region cell stage hescs based findings hescs verified otx directly induced expression setda binding promoter leading increased hkme levels hescs pn embryos findings suggest maternal transcription factor otx regulates ega early embryogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms,Epigenetics
"While environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to urothelial carcinoma (UC) development, their differential effects on bladder cancer (UB) versus upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated location-specific risk factors and the mediating role of LINE-1 DNA methylation in UC carcinogenesis. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted, comprising 478 UC cases (266 UB, 204 UTUC) and 569 controls. The risk factors, including smoking, Chinese herbal medicine use, comorbidities, and blood levels of arsenic, cadmium, and lead, were assessed through questionnaires and blood sample analysis. LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were measured by pyrosequencing. LASSO regression for variable selection and logistic regression for risk assessment. Mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the role of LINE-1 DNA methylation in the relationship between environmental exposures and UC risk. UB risk was associated with male sex, smoking, chronic kidney disease (CKD), elevated blood arsenic, and diabetes (all p < 0.0001), while UTUC risk was primarily linked to female sex (p = 0.0004) and CKD (p < 0.0001). LINE-1 hypermethylation was associated with both UB and UTUC risk (p < 0.0001). Notably, LINE-1 methylation significantly mediated the relationship between smoking and UC risk, particularly in males, while no significant mediation was observed for other exposures. This study demonstrates distinct risk profiles for UB and UTUC, and identifies LINE-1 methylation as a key mediator in smoking-related UC risk, especially in men.

"Skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining motor function and metabolic homeostasis, with its loss or atrophy leading to significant health consequences. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in muscle biology; however, their precise roles in muscle function and pathology remain to be fully elucidated. This study demonstrates that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is preferentially expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers and dynamically regulated during muscle development, aging, and in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Using both loss- and gain-of-function mice models, this study shows that lncRNA-MEG3 is critical for preserving muscle mass and function. Its depletion leads to muscle atrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired regenerative capacity, while overexpression enhances muscle mass, increases oxidative muscle fiber content, and improves endurance. Notably, lncRNA-MEG3 overexpression in MDX mice significantly alleviates muscle wasting and adipose tissue infiltration. Mechanistically, this study uncovers a novel interaction between lncRNA-MEG3 and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), where lncRNA-MEG3 binds to SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (Suz12), stabilizes PRC2, facilitates SUZ12 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and regulates the epigenetic modulation of four and a half lim domains 3 (Fhl3) and ring finger protein 128 (Rnf128).

"Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a critical complication in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) awaiting anticoagulation reinitiation. No reliable predictive model exists for assessing HT risk for these patients. Clinical decisions typically rely on NIHSS score and infarct size; however, other relevant risk factors remain insufficiently explored. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for assessing the risk of HT in AIS patients with AF from stroke onset to anticoagulation therapy reinitiation. This retrospective study included AIS patients with AF from two comprehensive medical centers in China. The primary outcome was HT postinfarction confirmed with CT/MRI before anticoagulation reinitiation. Significant predictors were identified via LASSO regression in the training set, followed by multivariable logistic regression for developing a predictive model and generating the nomogram. Model performance was validated in a separate external cohort. In the training cohort (n = 629), 174 patients (27.7%) developed HT. LASSO logistic regression revealed that infarct size, NIHSS score, diabetes mellitus, reperfusion therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, and prehospital antihypertensive treatment were significant HT predictors. In the external validation cohort (n = 236), 61 patients (25.8%) developed HT. The nomogram exhibited strong predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.720 in the training set and 0.747 in the validation set.

"Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral replication in the blood, HIV persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and causes chronic neurocognitive impairment, a hallmark of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). This review looks at the complex interactions among HIV, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and the roles of viral proteins, immune cell trafficking, and pro-inflammatory mediators in establishing and maintaining latent viral reservoirs in the CNS, particularly microglia and astrocytes. Key findings show disruption of the BBB, monocyte infiltration, and activation of CNS-resident cells by HIV proteins like Tat and gp120, contributing to the neuroinflammatory environment and neuronal damage.

"The persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) within viral reservoirs poses significant challenges to eradication efforts. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, are potential factors influencing the latency and persistence of HIV. This study details the development and application of techniques to assess CpG methylation in the promoter regions of the <i>CCR5</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> genes, which are key HIV-1 coreceptors. Using both Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing methods, we examined 51 biological samples from 17 people living with HIV at three time points: baseline (week 0) and post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) at weeks 24 and 48. Our results revealed that <i>CXCR4</i> promoter CpG sites were largely unmethylated, while <i>CCR5</i> promoter CpGs exhibited significant variability in methylation levels. Specifically, <i>CCR5</i> CpG 1 showed a significant decrease in methylation from week 0 to week 48, while <i>CXCR4</i> CpG 3 displayed a significant decrease between week 0 and week 24. These differences were statistically significant when compared with non-HIV-infected controls. These findings demonstrate distinct methylation patterns between <i>CCR5</i> and <i>CXCR4</i> promoters in people living with HIV over time, suggesting that epigenetic modifications may play a role in regulating the persistence of HIV-1. Our techniques provide a reliable framework for assessing gene promoter methylation and could be applied in further research on the epigenetics of HIV.",Epigenetics,persistence human immunodeficiency virus hiv within viral reservoirs poses significant challenges eradication efforts epigenetic alterations including dna methylation potential factors influencing latency persistence hiv study details development application techniques assess cpg methylation promoter regions iccri icxcri genes key hiv coreceptors using sanger sequencing pyrosequencing methods examined biological samples people living hiv three time points baseline week postantiretroviral therapy art weeks results revealed icxcri promoter cpg sites largely unmethylated iccri promoter cpgs exhibited significant variability methylation levels specifically iccri cpg showed significant decrease methylation week week icxcri cpg displayed significant decrease week week differences statistically significant compared nonhivinfected controls findings demonstrate distinct methylation patterns iccri icxcri promoters people living hiv time suggesting epigenetic modifications may play role regulating persistence hiv techniques provide reliable framework assessing gene promoter methylation could applied research epigenetics hiv,Epigenetics
"The synthetic cortisol analog budesonide (BUD) is an essential drug employed to manage chronic inflammatory diseases in humans, mainly those involving gastroenteric and airway mucosa, such as rhinitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, esophagitis, gastritis, and colitis, with high levels of success. As a glucocorticoid, BUD prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and the recruitment of immune cells into the inflamed mucosa. However, emerging evidence indicates that BUD, unlike classical glucocorticoids, is also a potent modulator of stem and cancer cell behavior/plasticity. Certainly, BUD stabilizes cell-cell adhesions, preventing embryonic stem cell differentiation and inhibiting the development of 3D gastruloids. In addition, BUD inhibits the motile/invasive propensity of different cancer cells, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Finally, it prevents the infection of positive single-stranded human-infecting RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. At a molecular level, BUD induces epigenetic changes and modifies the transcriptome of epithelial, stem, and cancer cells, providing molecular support to the immune cell-independent activity of BUD. Here, we performed an in-depth review of these unexpected activities of BUD, identified by unbiased drug screening programs, and we emphasize the molecular mechanisms modulated by this efficacious drug that deserve further research.",Epigenetics,synthetic cortisol analog budesonide bud essential drug employed manage chronic inflammatory diseases humans mainly involving gastroenteric airway mucosa rhinitis laryngitis bronchitis esophagitis gastritis colitis high levels success glucocorticoid bud prevents expression proinflammatory cytokineschemokines recruitment immune cells inflamed mucosa however emerging evidence indicates bud unlike classical glucocorticoids also potent modulator stem cancer cell behaviorplasticity certainly bud stabilizes cellcell adhesions preventing embryonic stem cell differentiation inhibiting development gastruloids addition bud inhibits motileinvasive propensity different cancer cells including breast lung pancreatic cancer finally prevents infection positive singlestranded humaninfecting rna viruses sarscov molecular level bud induces epigenetic changes modifies transcriptome epithelial stem cancer cells providing molecular support immune cellindependent activity bud performed indepth review unexpected activities bud identified unbiased drug screening programs emphasize molecular mechanisms modulated efficacious drug deserve research,Epigenetics
"<b>Background:</b> Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and epigenetic modifier enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) have emerged as promising options in the pharmacotherapy of malignant tumors. Recently, we demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects of the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and the EZH2 inhibitors GSK126 or tazemetostat in patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) models. Importantly, all three drugs are substrates of the two most important plasma membrane multidrug transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, with abemaciclib and tazemetostat also being inhibitors of these proteins. <b>Methods:</b> To investigate whether increased intracellular accumulation of either of the two drugs used in combination could have contributed to corresponding synergisms, we developed a simple LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous detection of the three substances in cell culture lysates. The method was validated in accordance with the current International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guideline M10 on bioanalytical method validation and study sample analysis. <b>Results:</b> All acceptance criteria were met. Subsequent analysis of intracellular drug concentrations confirmed increased cellular uptake of tazemetostat in the presence of abemaciclib in both GBM cell lines studied compared to single agent treatment. A comparable pattern was also observed for GSK126, but in only one of the two cell lines used. <b>Conclusions:</b> In conclusion, the observed synergistic antitumor effect could be partly due to increased intracellular accumulation, although this alone is certainly not sufficient to explain it. Overall, the developed method provides a valuable approach for characterizing interactions at the transport level and for predicting the efficiency of both anticancer substance classes in different cell lines.",Epigenetics,bbackgroundb inhibitors cyclindependent kinases cdks epigenetic modifier enhancer zeste homolog ezh emerged promising options pharmacotherapy malignant tumors recently demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects cdk inhibitor abemaciclib ezh inhibitors gsk tazemetostat patientderived glioblastoma gbm models importantly three drugs substrates two important plasma membrane multidrug transporters abcb abcg abemaciclib tazemetostat also inhibitors proteins bmethodsb investigate whether increased intracellular accumulation either two drugs used combination could contributed corresponding synergisms developed simple lcmsms method simultaneous detection three substances cell culture lysates method validated accordance current international council harmonization technical requirements pharmaceuticals human use ich guideline bioanalytical method validation study sample analysis bresultsb acceptance criteria met subsequent analysis intracellular drug concentrations confirmed increased cellular uptake tazemetostat presence abemaciclib gbm cell lines studied compared single agent treatment comparable pattern also observed gsk one two cell lines used bconclusionsb conclusion observed synergistic antitumor effect could partly due increased intracellular accumulation although alone certainly sufficient explain overall developed method provides valuable approach characterizing interactions transport level predicting efficiency anticancer substance classes different cell lines,Epigenetics

The aim of this study was to assess the methylation levels of specific DNA sequences from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in a population with ALS to elucidate their relationship with nutritional status and the evolution of the disease. <b>Methods</b>: Patients with ALS were evaluated between 2013 and 2021 (<i>n</i> = 66). They were categorized according to their nutritional status, using the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, and disease progression, using the ALS Functional Rating (ALSFRS-R) Scale. DNA samples were extracted from leukocytes at the time of diagnosis for analysis of DNA methylation levels of markers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and global methylation (D-loop, GSTP1, and LINE-1). <b>Results</b>: According to the GLIM criteria, 29 (43.9%) patients had malnutrition (22.7%-moderate; 21.2%-severe), which was positively correlated with ALS disease progression (r = 0.414; <i>p</i> < 0.01) and death (r = 0.687; <i>p</i> < 0.01).

"Transposon is the main component of the eukaryotic genome, and more and more plant genome data show that transposons are diverse in regulating genome structure, variation, function and evolution, with different transposition mechanisms in the genome. Hybridization and polyploidy play an important role in promoting plant speciation and evolution, and recent studies have shown that polyploidy is usually accompanied by the expansion of transposons, which affect the genome size and structure of polyploid plants. Transposons can insert into genes and intergenic regions, resulting in great differences in the overall genome structure of closely related plant species, and it can also capture gene segments in the genome to increase the copy number of genes. In addition, transposons influence the epigenetic modification state of the genome and regulate the expression of the gene, while plant phenotype, biological and abiotic stress response are also regulated by transposons.

"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of gene expression, influencing chromatin remodeling and playing a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Aberrant HDAC activity has been linked to cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases, making these enzymes attractive therapeutic targets. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have gained significant attention, particularly those containing zinc-binding groups (ZBGs), which interact directly with the catalytic zinc ion in the enzyme's active site. The structural diversity of ZBGs profoundly impacts the potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics of HDACis. While hydroxamic acids remain the most widely used ZBGs, their limitations, such as metabolic instability and off-target effects, have driven the development of alternative scaffolds, including <i>ortho</i>-aminoanilides, mercaptoacetamides, alkylhydrazides, oxadiazoles, and more. This review explores the structural and mechanistic aspects of different ZBGs, their interactions with HDAC isoforms, and their influence on inhibitor selectivity. Advances in structure-based drug design have allowed the fine-tuning of HDACi pharmacophores, leading to more selective and efficacious compounds with improved drug-like properties.

"Physical activity (PA) and body composition are important lifestyle factors that influence public health. Research suggests that DNA regions (CpG site locations) are differentially methylated in a physically active population. This meta-analysis aimed to identify CpG sites associated with various levels of PA and associated metabolic pathways. The meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, SportDISCUS, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science. Epigenomic analyses performed on DNA of participants with no underlying health conditions were included. Articles were screened using Rayyan AI and extracted CpG sites, and their location were confirmed using the EWAS catalogue. Six studies comprising 770 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed on clinical metrics extracted from the six studies and showed that BMI, blood pressure, insulin and glucose testing are significantly improved upon PA intervention. Amongst the included studies, a total of 257 CpG sites were differentially methylated in physically active participants, with 134 CpGs located in 92 genes associated with obesity-related pathways. The identified differentially methylated genes either belonged to the lipid metabolism or insulin signalling pathway. The genes which were differentially regulated in multiple tissue types and studies are JAZF1 (insulin signalling, and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways) and NAV1 (mTOR signalling pathway). In conclusion, the current epigenomic meta-analysis showed that PA levels induce differential DNA methylation signatures on genes that affect metabolism.

"Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) comprise a heterogeneous tumor group arising from neuroendocrine cells, commonly originating in the gastroenteropancreatic tract and bronchopulmonary system. Their incidence has risen significantly, owing to improved diagnostic techniques and increased clinical recognition. While previous reviews have explored the molecular and genetic basis of NENs, limited attention has been given to the role of epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, in tumorigenesis and disease progression. This review focuses on lung, pancreas, and thyroid well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), highlighting epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, as promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and risk stratification. Aberrant DNA methylation can silence key tumor suppressor genes, including RASSF1A and CDKN2A, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. Integrating DNA methylation profiles with conventional biomarkers such as chromogranin A (CgA) may enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform therapeutic strategies. Emerging epigenetic therapies offer potential avenues for personalized treatment based on molecular profiling. Unlike prior reviews that broadly cover genetic and epigenetic changes in NENs, this review uniquely emphasizes the translational potential of epigenetic biomarkers in clinical practice.

This study investigated the potential contribution of inflammation, redox signaling, and the immune system in the pathogenesis of PG. This case-control study included 36 patients with PG and 30 controls. We have determined the serum concentrations of acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein-CRP, alpha1 glycoprotein acid-AGPA, Albumin), interleukin-17A -IL-17A, β2 microglobulin-β2MG, reduced glutathione-GSH, oxidized glutathione- GSSG, the GSH/GSSG ratio, and hematological parameters (white blood cells-WBC, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio-NLR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate-ESR) in patients with PG compared with controls. Furthermore, we have evaluated the variations in these markers before and after treatment in PG patients. The serum concentrations of acute phase proteins (CRP, AGPA, and Albumin) and the IL-17A, β2MG, GSH, GSSG, and GSH/GSSG ratio were significantly different between the PG group and controls. Hematological parameters (WBC, NLR, and ESR), acute phase proteins (CRP, AGPA, and albumin), and IL-17A showed an exaggerated and persistent inflammatory response in patients with PG.

"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and aggressive primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor in adults. GBMs exhibit genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, posing difficulties in surveillance and being associated with high rates of recurrence and mortality. Nevertheless, due to the high infiltrating ability of glioblastoma cells, and regardless of the considerable progress made in radiotherapeutic, chemotherapeutic, and surgical protocols, the treatment of GBM is still inefficient. Conventional diagnostic approaches, such as neuroimaging techniques and tissue biopsies, which are invasive maneuvers, present certain challenges and limitations in providing real-time information, and are incapable of differentiating pseudo-progression related to treatment from real tumor progression. Liquid biopsy, the analysis of biomarkers such as nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), or tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) that are present in body fluids, provides a minimally invasive and dynamic method of diagnosis and continuous monitoring for GBM.

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumors, characterized by high heterogeneity, invasive growth, and resistance to conventional therapies. The 2021 WHO classification highlights the importance of molecular diagnostics, integrating genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic alterations alongside histological and immunohistochemical criteria. <i>Materials and methods</i>: Key molecular regulators, including ATRX, OLIG2, MGMT, and IDH2, play critical roles in chromatin remodeling, transcriptional reprogramming, DNA repair, and metabolic adaptation. However, their specific expression patterns and functional roles in GBM remain incompletely understood. This study utilizes publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to assess the transcriptional profiles of ATRX, OLIG2, MGMT, and IDH2 in GBM, aiming to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. <i>Results</i>: The expression analysis revealed that ATRX is downregulated at the gene level but overexpressed at the protein level, while OLIG2 is consistently overexpressed at both levels. MGMT showed no statistically significant changes in either gene or protein expression, whereas IDH2 was not significantly altered at the gene level but was downregulated at the protein level (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

"This study investigated whether the supplementation of prebiotic inulin to gestating sows programmatically affects offspring growth performance and meat quality while exploring its epigenetic effects through histone acetylation modulation. After mating, sixty multiparous sows (Landrace × Yorkshire; parity 2-3) were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with inulin (0% vs. 1.5%) and fat (0% or 5%) supplementation until farrowing. Post-weaning, five litters (10 piglets per litter) per treatment were selected and maintained in their original litter for fattening under standardized feeding. The results demonstrated that maternal inulin supplementation during gestation accomplished the following: (1) Increased offspring liver index by 13.4% at weaning and 6.8% at finishing (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while reducing the finishing-phase backfat thickness by 11.6% (<i>p</i> < 0.01), with a significant inulin × fat interaction attenuating fat-induced abdominal lipid accumulation at weaning (<i>p</i> = 0.05). (2) Decreased <i>longissimus dorsi</i> muscle lightness (L*) by 4.5% in finishing pigs (<i>p</i> = 0.02) without altering the other meat quality parameters. (3) Suppressed offspring liver lipid deposition at birth and finishing (<i>p</i> < 0.05), concomitant with upregulated hepatic <i>PGC-1α</i> and <i>CPT1A</i> expression (<i>p</i> < 0.05). (4) Elevated neonatal serum butyrate by 15.6% (<i>p</i> = 0.06) while inhibiting hepatic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and enhancing histone H3/H4 acetylation (<i>p</i> < 0.01). These findings suggest that maternal inulin supplementation during gestation mitigates offspring hepatic lipid deposition through butyrate-mediated epigenetic regulation, where microbial-derived butyrate from inulin fermentation inhibits HDAC activity, enhances histone acetylation levels, and upregulates fatty acid β-oxidation gene expression.

"Bladder cancer (BCa) is a highly recurrent malignancy that requires sensitive and noninvasive diagnostic and predictive markers. Conventional diagnostic tools, such as cystoscopy and urine cytology, are far from ideal in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and patient compliance. In this narrative review, the development of novel urinary markers for the diagnosis of BCa is highlighted, with a focus on their application in the clinical arena, detection accuracy, and future potential. An extensive analysis of new urinary biomarkers, including proteinuria-based tests, DNA methylation biomarkers, and RNA-based molecular panels, has been conducted. Various molecular tests, such as Cxbladder<sup>®</sup>, Bladder EpiCheck<sup>®</sup>, and UroSEEK, are highly sensitive and clinically valid. Urinary biomarkers provide a promising noninvasive alternative for traditional BCa diagnostics with enhanced specificity and the possibility of early diagnosis.

"<i>Background:</i> Advances in molecular genetic diagnostics and emerging opportunities for targeted treatment have opened new horizons in precision oncology. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are the subgroup of these agents with which the most clinical experience has been gathered so far. However, little data is available on the effect of TKI agents on the expression levels of molecules responsible for epigenetic regulation. <i>Methods:</i> In this study, we investigated the effect of in vitro and in vivo treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor agents on the expression of epigenetic regulators in hematological malignancies and solid tumors, based on data included in the functional genomics repository Gene Expression Omnibus. <i>Results:</i> Statistical analysis of datasets and series of gene expression patterns revealed numerous significant changes in the levels of epigenetic writers, erasers, microRNAs and members of chromatin-remodeling complexes following TKI treatment. Previously published data about the role of these epigenetic modifiers in malignant diseases has also been summarized. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our results may contribute to the establishment of novel treatment strategies aiming at the combinatorial administration of TKI and epidrugs in cancer, leading to less toxic therapy with further improved results.",Epigenetics,ibackgroundi advances molecular genetic diagnostics emerging opportunities targeted treatment opened new horizons precision oncology tyrosine kinase inhibitors tki subgroup agents clinical experience gathered far however little data available effect tki agents expression levels molecules responsible epigenetic regulation imethodsi study investigated effect vitro vivo treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor agents expression epigenetic regulators hematological malignancies solid tumors based data included functional genomics repository gene expression omnibus iresultsi statistical analysis datasets series gene expression patterns revealed numerous significant changes levels epigenetic writers erasers micrornas members chromatinremodeling complexes following tki treatment previously published data role epigenetic modifiers malignant diseases also summarized iconclusionsi results may contribute establishment novel treatment strategies aiming combinatorial administration tki epidrugs cancer leading less toxic therapy improved results,Epigenetics
"Uniparental disomy (UPD) is the inheritance of both copies of a chromosome from a single parent, leading to distinct genetic conditions. Maternal UPD of chromosome 6 (UPD(6)mat) is extremely rare, with few molecularly confirmed cases reported. We report a prematurely born female with isodisomic UPD(6)mat, presenting with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, dysmorphic features, and a sacrococcygeal teratoma. In addition, we reviewed 24 confirmed UPD(6)mat cases to assess clinical patterns in prenatal findings, birth outcomes, and postnatal features. Trio whole-exome sequencing revealed complete isodisomy of chromosome 6 and a de novo heterozygous <i>DIAPH2</i> variant of uncertain significance. In the literature review, IUGR was present in 87% of cases, with most individuals born small for gestational age and preterm. Failure to thrive and neurodevelopmental issues were also frequent. While the exact molecular basis remains unknown, imprinting disturbances-similar to those in UPD(6)pat-and cryptic trisomy 6 mosaicism, particularly in heterodisomy, are the most likely mechanisms. No specific gene or consistent epigenetic abnormality has been identified. This study aims to enhance the understanding of the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of UPD(6)mat, improving diagnostic and management approaches for this ultra-rare genetic disorder.

"Codon usage bias affects gene expression and translation efficiency across species. The effective number of codons (ENC) and GC content influence codon preference, often displaying unimodal or bimodal distributions. This study investigates the correlation between ENC and GC rankings across species and how their relationship affects codon usage distributions. I analyzed nuclear-encoded genes from 17 species representing six kingdoms: one bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i>), three fungi (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, and <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>), one archaea (<i>Methanococcus aeolicus</i>), three protists (<i>Rickettsia hoogstraalii</i>, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>, and <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>),), three plants (<i>Musa acuminata</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and six animals (<i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, <i>Apis mellifera</i>, <i>Polistes canadensis</i>, <i>Mus musculus</i>, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and <i>Takifugu rubripes</i>). Genes in all 17 species were ranked by GC content and ENC, and correlations were assessed. I examined how adding or subtracting these rankings influenced their overall distribution in a new method that I call Two-Rank Order Normalization or TRON. The equation, TRON = SUM(ABS((GC rank<sub>1</sub>:GC rank<sub>N</sub>) - (ENC rank<sub>1</sub>:ENC rank<sub>N</sub>))/(N<sup>2</sup>/3), where (GC rank<sub>1</sub>:GC rank<sub>N</sub>) is a rank-order series of GC rank, (ENC rank<sub>1</sub>:ENC rank<sub>N</sub>) is a rank-order series ENC rank, sorted by the rank-order series GC rank. The denominator of TRON, N<sup>2</sup>/3, is the normalization factor because it is the expected value of the sum of the absolute value of GC rank-ENC rank for all genes if GC rank and ENC rank are not correlated. ENC and GC rankings are positively correlated (i.e., ENC increases as GC increases) in AT-rich species such as honeybees (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.60, slope = 0.78) and wasps (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52, slope = 0.72) and negatively correlated (i.e., ENC decreases as GC increases) in GC-rich species such as humans (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.38, slope = -0.61) and rice (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, slope = -0.77). Second, the GC rank-ENC rank distributions change from unimodal to bimodal as GC content increases in the 17 species. Third, the GC rank+ENC rank distributions change from bimodal to unimodal as GC content increases in the 17 species. Fourth, the slopes of the correlations (GC versus ENC) in all 17 species are negatively correlated with TRON (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98) (see Graphic Abstract). The correlation between ENC rank and GC rank differs among species, shaping codon usage distributions in opposite ways depending on whether a species' nuclear-encoded genes are AT-rich or GC-rich. Understanding these patterns might provide insights into translation efficiency, epigenetics mediated by CpG DNA methylation, epitranscriptomics of RNA modifications, RNA secondary structures, evolutionary pressures, and potential applications in genetic engineering and biotechnology.",Epigenetics,codon usage bias affects gene expression translation efficiency across species effective number codons enc gc content influence codon preference often displaying unimodal bimodal distributions study investigates correlation enc gc rankings across species relationship affects codon usage distributions analyzed nuclearencoded genes species representing six kingdoms one bacteria iescherichia colii three fungi isaccharomyces cerevisiaei ineurospora crassai ischizosaccharomyces pombei one archaea imethanococcus aeolicusi three protists irickettsia hoogstraaliii idictyostelium discoideumi iplasmodium falciparumi three plants imusa acuminatai ioryza sativai iarabidopsis thalianai six animals ianopheles gambiaei iapis melliferai ipolistes canadensisi imus musculusi ihomo sapiensi itakifugu rubripesi genes species ranked gc content enc correlations assessed examined adding subtracting rankings influenced overall distribution new method call tworank order normalization tron equation tron sumabsgc ranksubsubgc ranksubnsub enc ranksubsubenc ranksubnsubnsupsup gc ranksubsubgc ranksubnsub rankorder series gc rank enc ranksubsubenc ranksubnsub rankorder series enc rank sorted rankorder series gc rank denominator tron nsupsup normalization factor expected value sum absolute value gc rankenc rank genes gc rank enc rank correlated enc gc rankings positively correlated ie enc increases gc increases atrich species honeybees rsupsup slope wasps rsupsup slope negatively correlated ie enc decreases gc increases gcrich species humans rsupsup slope rice rsupsup slope second gc rankenc rank distributions change unimodal bimodal gc content increases species third gc rankenc rank distributions change bimodal unimodal gc content increases species fourth slopes correlations gc versus enc species negatively correlated tron rsupsup see graphic abstract correlation enc rank gc rank differs among species shaping codon usage distributions opposite ways depending whether species nuclearencoded genes atrich gcrich understanding patterns might provide insights translation efficiency epigenetics mediated cpg dna methylation epitranscriptomics rna modifications rna secondary structures evolutionary pressures potential applications genetic engineering biotechnology,Epigenetics
"Over the past two decades, suicide has consistently ranked among the leading causes of death in the United States. While suicide deaths are closely associated with uicidal ideation and attempts, these are not good predictors of future suicide deaths. Establishing who is at risk of suicide remains a challenge that is mostly hampered by the lack of understanding of its pathophysiology. Nonetheless, evidence continues to accumulate suggesting that suicide is driven by a complex and dynamic interaction between environmental factors and genetics. The identification of genes that place people at risk of suicide remains elusive, but data are rapidly evolving. In this narrative review, we describe how Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) genes, particularly <i>TPH1</i> and <i>TPH2</i>, have been associated with suicide in various publications. There is also replicated evidence linking the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene to suicide, with its most consistent results originating from epigenetic studies. Not surprisingly, many genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis have been connected with suicide, but these data require replication. Finally, among the inflammatory genes studied in suicide, only specific polymorphisms in <i>TNF-alpha</i> and <i>IL-6</i> may increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. In conclusion, significant work remains to be performed as inconsistencies undermine the reliability of genetic results in suicide. Potential avenues for future research are proposed.",Epigenetics,past two decades suicide consistently ranked among leading causes death united states suicide deaths closely associated uicidal ideation attempts good predictors future suicide deaths establishing risk suicide remains challenge mostly hampered lack understanding pathophysiology nonetheless evidence continues accumulate suggesting suicide driven complex dynamic interaction environmental factors genetics identification genes place people risk suicide remains elusive data rapidly evolving narrative review describe tryptophan hydroxylase tph genes particularly itphi itphi associated suicide various publications also replicated evidence linking brainderived neurotrophic factor gene suicide consistent results originating epigenetic studies surprisingly many genes involved hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis connected suicide data require replication finally among inflammatory genes studied suicide specific polymorphisms itnfalphai iili may increase susceptibility suicidal behavior conclusion significant work remains performed inconsistencies undermine reliability genetic results suicide potential avenues future research proposed,Epigenetics
"The dysregulation of miRNA expression in samples from autistic individuals indicates that they are involved in autism. The participation of miRNAs in paternal epigenetic inheritance has also been reported. This study used bioinformatics tools to analyze the literature and genetic databases to search for miRNAs associated with autism, aiming to explore their suitability to investigate paternal epigenetic inheritance. Autism-related miRNAs were searched in public databases using bioinformatic tools (miRNA-to-genes analysis). The genes targeted by these autism-related miRNAs, which are common to neurons, sperm, and PBMCs, were identified. Enrichment analyses were performed to identify the biological processes regulated by the candidate miRNAs. Autism-related miRNAs were also identified by an inverse analysis (genes-to-miRNA analysis), starting from autism-related genes. In the miRNA-to-gene analysis, 416 miRNAs involved in autism were found, of which 77 were expressed in sperm, PBMCs, and neurons. From these, 18 were differentially expressed in the brain and in at least one peripheral sample (saliva or blood), suggesting that they might be suitable to be used in the investigation of autism biomarkers and inheritance. In the genes-to-miRNA analysis, 36 miRNAs were identified, from which 9 coincided with the results of direct analysis. Although there is no consensus about miRNAs related to autism, there are candidate miRNAs that show clear potential to be explored as biomarkers. The coincidence in the expression of miRNAs in sperm, neurons, and PBMCs indicates that they are valuable biological samples to study the role of miRNAs in the paternal epigenetic inheritance of autism.",Epigenetics,dysregulation mirna expression samples autistic individuals indicates involved autism participation mirnas paternal epigenetic inheritance also reported study used bioinformatics tools analyze literature genetic databases search mirnas associated autism aiming explore suitability investigate paternal epigenetic inheritance autismrelated mirnas searched public databases using bioinformatic tools mirnatogenes analysis genes targeted autismrelated mirnas common neurons sperm pbmcs identified enrichment analyses performed identify biological processes regulated candidate mirnas autismrelated mirnas also identified inverse analysis genestomirna analysis starting autismrelated genes mirnatogene analysis mirnas involved autism found expressed sperm pbmcs neurons differentially expressed brain least one peripheral sample saliva blood suggesting might suitable used investigation autism biomarkers inheritance genestomirna analysis mirnas identified coincided results direct analysis although consensus mirnas related autism candidate mirnas show clear potential explored biomarkers coincidence expression mirnas sperm neurons pbmcs indicates valuable biological samples study role mirnas paternal epigenetic inheritance autism,Epigenetics
"Less than 5% of the DNA sequence encodes for proteins, and the remainder encodes for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among the members of the ncRNA family, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in the insurgence and progression of several cancers, including leukemia. Thought to have different molecular mechanisms, both miRNAs and lncRNAs act as epigenetic factors modulating gene expression and influencing hematopoietic differentiation, proliferation and immune system function. Here, we discuss the most recent findings on the main molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs and lncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of pediatric T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), pointing out their potential utility as therapeutic targets and as biomarkers for early diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis. miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, acting both as tumor suppressors and as oncomiRs. By contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the literature highlights lncRNAs as acting only as oncogenes in this type of cancer by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell cycle and drug resistance. Additionally, here, we discuss how these molecules could be detected in the plasma of T-ALL patients, highlighting that lncRNAs may represent a new class of promising accurate and sensitive biomarkers in these young patients. Thus, the unveiling of the aberrant signature of circulating and intracellular levels of lncRNAs could have great clinical utility for obtaining a more accurate definition of prognosis and uncovering novel therapeutic strategies against T-ALL in children. However, further investigations are needed to better define the standard methodological procedure for their quantification and to obtain their specific targeting in T-ALL pediatric patients.",Epigenetics,less dna sequence encodes proteins remainder encodes noncoding rnas ncrnas among members ncrna family micrornas mirnas long noncoding rnas lncrnas play pivotal role insurgence progression several cancers including leukemia thought different molecular mechanisms mirnas lncrnas act epigenetic factors modulating gene expression influencing hematopoietic differentiation proliferation immune system function discuss recent findings main molecular mechanisms mirnas lncrnas involved pathogenesis progression pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia tall pointing potential utility therapeutic targets biomarkers early diagnosis risk stratification prognosis mirnas involved pathogenesis tall acting tumor suppressors oncomirs contrast best knowledge literature highlights lncrnas acting oncogenes type cancer inhibiting apoptosis promoting cell cycle drug resistance additionally discuss molecules could detected plasma tall patients highlighting lncrnas may represent new class promising accurate sensitive biomarkers young patients thus unveiling aberrant signature circulating intracellular levels lncrnas could great clinical utility obtaining accurate definition prognosis uncovering novel therapeutic strategies tall children however investigations needed better define standard methodological procedure quantification obtain specific targeting tall pediatric patients,Epigenetics
"The stone pine (<i>Pinus pinea</i> L.) is an evergreen coniferous species valued for its edible seeds, which provide significant economic benefits to local populations. Remarkable phenotypic plasticity but low genetic variation characterizes the species. In Greece, natural populations of <i>P. pinea</i> are part of the Natura 2000 network and are protected under Annex I Priority Habitat type 2270. These populations, located across six Natura 2000 sites (including two islands), face increasing threats from tourism and climate change, leading to ecosystem degradation. Genetic and epigenetic studies are critical for the conservation of forest species because they provide insights into the genetic diversity, adaptive potential, and resilience of species, helping to inform effective management strategies and protect biodiversity in changing environments. This study aims to assess the genetic and epigenetic diversity of <i>P. pinea</i> in four Natura 2000 sites using molecular markers and to propose conservation strategies to ensure the species' long-term sustainability. Additionally, a preliminary investigation of water potential under maximum daily water demand was conducted to evaluate the species' adaptive response. Genetic analysis was performed using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers, while epigenetic analysis was conducted using Methylation-Susceptible Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) markers. Sampling was carried out in four Natura 2000 areas, where genetic and epigenetic diversity patterns were examined. Furthermore, a preliminary study on water potential under peak daily water demand conditions was conducted to assess the species' physiological adaptation to environmental stress. The results of this study provide valuable insights into conservation strategies by highlighting the potential role of epigenetic variation in the adaptability of <i>P. pinea</i>, despite its low genetic variability. Understanding the species' epigenetic flexibility can inform conservation efforts aimed at enhancing its resilience to environmental stressors, such as climate change. Additionally, the preliminary water potential analysis contributes to identifying physiological traits that may help predict the species' survival under varying environmental conditions, guiding the development of more targeted conservation practices and management plans. Further research could refine these findings and strengthen their application in conservation efforts. The conclusions emphasize the critical importance of this research in informing conservation efforts for <i>P. pinea</i> in Greece, particularly considering climate change and human pressures. The results highlight the need for both in-situ and ex-situ conservation strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the species. The key recommendations include the protection of natural habitats, the implementation of controlled seed collection practices, and further research into the epigenetic mechanisms that may enhance the species' resilience to environmental stress.

"CCA is a highly desmoplastic malignant cancer and is the second most common primary liver malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for approximately 15% of all primary liver tumors. CCA has a poor prognosis, with an average five-year survival rate of 9%, which is lower than that of pancreatic cancer. Although considerable efforts have been invested into the genomics, epigenetics, and risk factors, very little is known about what might have been the key causes for the high malignancy level of CCA. In this review, we analyze the incidence and mortality of CCA in different regions based on data from 1994 to 2022 obtained from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), discuss the current status of treatment of the disease, and focus on what might be the main factors contributing to the high malignancy level of CCA: alkalosis caused by the Fenton reaction, hypoxia, and the TIME. The review includes studies published from 1979 to 2024, aiming to provide an updated synthesis of basic early classical theoretical knowledge and current knowledge about CCA.

"The epigenetic regulation of gene expression through the covalent modification of histones is crucial for developing germline cells. To study the regulatory role of alternative splicing (AS) of euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2/G9A) in spermatogenesis in Mongolian horses, this study first examines the localization of the <i>EHMT2</i> gene in testicular support cells and then predicts the higher-order structures of sequences with and without AS. Two types of lentiviral vectors for overexpression were subsequently constructed for the <i>EHMT2</i> gene, one with AS and one without, to infect support cells. The proliferation and activity of infected cells were measured using CCK8, and the differential expression of spermatogenesis-related genes in the two types of support cells was analyzed via qRT-PCR. We analyzed the expression of <i>EHMT2</i> by immunofluorescence staining. <i>EHMT2</i> was expressed in the nuclei of Sertoli cells. The expression of spermatogenesis-related genes was measured in the two types of cells.

"The present study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation profile of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showing the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutation. In 103 patients, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using Infinium Methylation EPIC array was performed using samples of pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib-treatment plasma cfDNA (n = 101) and post-afatinib cfDNA (n = 84). Principal component analysis indicated that the cfDNA methylation profile was altered after afatinib treatment. Hierarchical clustering using the pre-afatinib cfDNA methylation profile revealed that cases with a fatal outcome were accumulated in specific clusters. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the pre-afatinib cfDNA methylation profile was significantly associated with both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), whereas the post-afatinib profile was not. The genes for which pre-afatinib cfDNA methylation levels were associated with PFS were accumulated in the cadherin, Wnt, and EGFR signaling pathways. Activation of EGFR-related signaling due to DNA methylation alterations might overturn the effect of afatinib. Pre-afatinib levels of CEP170 and CHCHD6 cfDNA methylation were associated with both PFS and OS. Both pre- and post-afatinib cfDNA methylation levels of SLC9A3R2 and INTS1 were associated with bone metastasis. Using the cfDNA methylation levels at two CpG sites, cg12721600 and cg05905155, patients showing an overall response were predicted with a sensitivity of 96% or more. The non-invasively measurable cfDNA methylation profile may reflect the corresponding profile in cancer cells, and that pre-treatment measurement may provide clinically useful information on EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.",Epigenetics,present study aimed clarify clinical significance cellfree dna cfdna methylation profile patients nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc showing epidermal growth factor receptor egfr gene mutation patients genomewide dna methylation analysis using infinium methylation epic array performed using samples pretyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinibtreatment plasma cfdna n postafatinib cfdna n principal component analysis indicated cfdna methylation profile altered afatinib treatment hierarchical clustering using preafatinib cfdna methylation profile revealed cases fatal outcome accumulated specific clusters moreover kaplanmeier analysis showed preafatinib cfdna methylation profile significantly associated progressionfree survival pfs overall survival os whereas postafatinib profile genes preafatinib cfdna methylation levels associated pfs accumulated cadherin wnt egfr signaling pathways activation egfrrelated signaling due dna methylation alterations might overturn effect afatinib preafatinib levels cep chchd cfdna methylation associated pfs os pre postafatinib cfdna methylation levels slcar ints associated bone metastasis using cfdna methylation levels two cpg sites cg cg patients showing overall response predicted sensitivity noninvasively measurable cfdna methylation profile may reflect corresponding profile cancer cells pretreatment measurement may provide clinically useful information egfr mutationpositive nsclc,Epigenetics
"This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts-such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia-is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules-such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT-are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression-through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation-the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.",Epigenetics,review discusses reprogramming breast tumor immune microenvironment immunosuppressive cold state immunologically active hot state complex interplay revealed accumulation metabolic byproductssuch lactate reactive oxygen species ros ammoniais shown impair tcell function promote tumor immune escape demonstrated tumor microenvironment tme dominated immunosuppressive cytokines including interleukin il transforming growth factor tgf il notably il produced regulatory cells breast cancer cells conversion conventional cells ilproducing induced regulatory cells along inhibition proinflammatory cytokine secretion contributes suppression antitumor immunity demonstrated key immune checkpoint moleculessuch pd pdl ctla tim lag tigitare upregulated within tme leading tcell exhaustion diminished immune responses blockade checkpoints shown restore tcell functionality proposed strategy convert cold tumors hot ones robust effector cell infiltration therapeutic potential chimeric antigen receptor cart cell therapy also explored targeting specific tumorassociated antigens glycoproteins receptor tyrosine kinases highlighted suggested cart cell efficacy enhanced combining cells immune checkpoint inhibitors immunomodulatory agents thereby overcoming barriers imposed immunosuppressive tme moreover role microbiome regulating estrogen metabolism systemic inflammation reviewed alterations gut microbiota shown affect tme microbiomebased interventions proposed additional means facilitate coldtohot transition concluded targeting metabolic immunological pathways underpin immune suppressionthrough combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade cart cell therapies microbiome modulationthe conversion breast tme cold hot achieved reprogramming anticipated enhance immune cell infiltration function thereby improving overall efficacy immunotherapies leading better clinical outcomes breast cancer patients,Epigenetics
"Gastrointestinal (GI) disease/dysfunction persists in people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving suppressive combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART) leading to epithelial barrier breakdown, microbial translocation and systemic inflammation that can drive non-AIDS associated comorbidities. Although epigenetic mechanisms are predicted to drive GI dysfunction, they remain unknown and unaddressed in HIV/SIV infection. The present study investigated genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, and gene expression exclusively in colon epithelial cells (CE) in response to simian immunodeficiency virus infection (SIV) and long-term low-dose delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing, we characterized DNA methylation changes in colonic epithelium (CE) of uninfected controls (n=5) and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) administered vehicle (VEH/SIV; n=7) or THC (THC/SIV; n=6). Intact jejunum resection segments (~5cm) were collected from sixteen ART treated SIV-infected RMs [(VEH/SIV/ART; n=8) and (THC/SIV/ART; n=8)] to confirm protein expression data identified in the colon of ART-naïve SIV-infected RMs. Transcriptomics data was used to confirm expression of differentially methylated genes. Protein expression of differentially methylated genes and their downstream targets was assessed using Immunofluorescence followed by HALO quantification. SIV infection in ART-naïve RMs induced marked hypomethylation throughout promoter-associated CpG islands (paCGIs) in genes related to inflammatory response (NLRP6, cGAS), cellular adhesion (PCDH17, CDH7) and proliferation (WIF1, SFRP1, TERT, and HAND2) in CEs. Moreover, low-dose THC reduced NLRP6 protein expression in CE by hypermethylating the NLRP6 paCGI and blocked polyI:C induced NLRP6 upregulation in vitro. In ART suppressed SIV-infected RMs, significant NLRP6 protein upregulation during acute infection was unaffected by long-term ART administration during chronic infection despite successful plasma and tissue viral suppression. In this group, NLRP6 protein upregulation was associated with significantly increased expression of necroptosis-driving proteins; phosphorylated-RIPK3(Ser199), phosphorylated-MLKL(Thr357/Ser358), and HMGB1. Most strikingly, adding ART to THC-treated SIV-infected RMs effectively reduced NLRP6 and necroptosis-driving protein expression to pre-infection levels. We conclude that DNA hypomethylation-assisted NLRP6 upregulation can lead to its constitutively high expression resulting in the activation of necroptosis signaling via the RIPK3/p-MLKL pathway that can eventually drive intestinal epithelial loss/death. From a clinical standpoint, low-dose phytocannabinoids in combination with ART could safely and successfully reduce/reverse persistent GI inflammatory responses via modulating DNA methylation.",Epigenetics,gastrointestinal gi diseasedysfunction persists people living hiv plwh receiving suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy art leading epithelial barrier breakdown microbial translocation systemic inflammation drive nonaids associated comorbidities although epigenetic mechanisms predicted drive gi dysfunction remain unknown unaddressed hivsiv infection present study investigated genomewide changes dna methylation gene expression exclusively colon epithelial cells ce response simian immunodeficiency virus infection siv longterm lowdose deltatetrahydrocannabinol thc using reducedrepresentation bisulfite sequencing characterized dna methylation changes colonic epithelium ce uninfected controls n sivinfected rhesus macaques rms administered vehicle vehsiv n thc thcsiv n intact jejunum resection segments cm collected sixteen art treated sivinfected rms vehsivart n thcsivart n confirm protein expression data identified colon artnave sivinfected rms transcriptomics data used confirm expression differentially methylated genes protein expression differentially methylated genes downstream targets assessed using immunofluorescence followed halo quantification siv infection artnave rms induced marked hypomethylation throughout promoterassociated cpg islands pacgis genes related inflammatory response nlrp cgas cellular adhesion pcdh cdh proliferation wif sfrp tert hand ces moreover lowdose thc reduced nlrp protein expression ce hypermethylating nlrp pacgi blocked polyic induced nlrp upregulation vitro art suppressed sivinfected rms significant nlrp protein upregulation acute infection unaffected longterm art administration chronic infection despite successful plasma tissue viral suppression group nlrp protein upregulation associated significantly increased expression necroptosisdriving proteins phosphorylatedripkser phosphorylatedmlklthrser hmgb strikingly adding art thctreated sivinfected rms effectively reduced nlrp necroptosisdriving protein expression preinfection levels conclude dna hypomethylationassisted nlrp upregulation lead constitutively high expression resulting activation necroptosis signaling via ripkpmlkl pathway eventually drive intestinal epithelial lossdeath clinical standpoint lowdose phytocannabinoids combination art could safely successfully reducereverse persistent gi inflammatory responses via modulating dna methylation,Epigenetics
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial and age-related disease. Additionally, age, sex, and risk factors for developing CRC may include genetic, epigenetic, and immunologic characteristics and lifestyle habits. Simultaneous examination of gene mutations and their products is vital for determining patient prognosis and treatment. Therefore, we assessed APC, KRAS, and TP53 plasma levels; inflammatory indices; and KRAS mutations in CRC patients and evaluated their role in cancer progression. The study population consisted of colorectal cancer patients (40 patients: 16 women and 24 men). KRAS mutations were detected using real-time PCR; APC, KRAS, and TP53 protein levels were measured via ELISA. The results revealed that inflammatory indices (MLR, PLR, NLR) are increased in CRC patients, especially in those with advanced stages. TP53 protein levels were increased in patients with progressive cancer, whereas no significant difference was detected in the plasma levels of APC and KRAS. The G12V KRAS mutation was associated with a poor prognosis and high PLR values. Our findings reveal that inflammatory indices such as the MLR, PLR, and NLR are linked to TP53 and APC plasma levels and offer new insights into their role in the development and progression of CRC.",Epigenetics,colorectal cancer crc multifactorial agerelated disease additionally age sex risk factors developing crc may include genetic epigenetic immunologic characteristics lifestyle habits simultaneous examination gene mutations products vital determining patient prognosis treatment therefore assessed apc kras tp plasma levels inflammatory indices kras mutations crc patients evaluated role cancer progression study population consisted colorectal cancer patients patients women men kras mutations detected using realtime pcr apc kras tp protein levels measured via elisa results revealed inflammatory indices mlr plr nlr increased crc patients especially advanced stages tp protein levels increased patients progressive cancer whereas significant difference detected plasma levels apc kras gv kras mutation associated poor prognosis high plr values findings reveal inflammatory indices mlr plr nlr linked tp apc plasma levels offer new insights role development progression crc,Epigenetics
"The plasma lipidome has emerged as an important indicator for assessing host metabolic and immune status in sepsis. While previous studies have largely examined specific lipid class changes in adults sepsis, comprehensive investigations into plasma lipidomic alterations in pediatric sepsis are limited. This study aimed to characterize the plasma lipidome in pediatric sepsis using a metabolomics-based exploratory approach, providing insights into pathophysiological mechanisms and potential biomarkers. A retrospective study was conducted on pediatric patients with sepsis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Untargeted lipidomics analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Orbitrap) was performed to compare metabolomic profiles between non-infected control patients and sepsis patients. Compared to controls, plasma lipid levels in sepsis patients decreased by 33.3%, increased by 20.2%, and remained unchanged in 46.5% of cases. A total of 1,257 differential lipids were identified in sepsis patients, with 24 lipids showing significant associations with pSOFA scores. In the recovery and deterioration subgroups, 186 differential lipids were identified, with triglyceride (TG) representing the highest proportion at 16.4%. Notably, 15 lipids with significant statistical differences were identified as differential lipid species through a comparison of those associated with pSOFA scores and those linked to sepsis prognosis. Fatty acid (FA) levels were significantly elevated in the sepsis group compared to controls, with arachidonic acid (FA(20:4)) showing the most significant increase (P < 0.001).

"The rapid evolution of single-cell sequencing technologies has significantly advanced our knowledge of cellular heterogeneity and the underlying molecular basis in healthy and diseased kidneys. While single-cell transcriptomic analysis excels in characterizing cell states in the heterogeneous population, the complex regulatory mechanisms governing the gene expressions are difficult to decipher using transcriptomic data alone. Single-cell sequencing technology has recently extended to include epigenome and other modalities, allowing single-cell multiomics analysis. Especially, the integrative analysis of epigenome and transcriptome dissects the cell-specific, gene-regulatory mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity. An increasing number of single-cell multimodal atlases are being generated in nephrology research, offering novel insights into cellular diversity and the underpinning epigenetic regulation.

"Patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) are usually diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, and the tumors often have immunosuppressive characteristics. Together, these factors are important for disease progression, drug resistance, and mortality. In this study, we used a combination of single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to identify the molecular mechanisms that lead to immunosuppression in HGSC. Primary tumors consistently showed a more active immune microenvironment than did omental tumors. In addition, we found that untreated primary tumors were mostly populated by dysfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells in later stages of differentiation; this, in turn, was correlated with expression changes in the interferon α and γ pathways in epithelial cells, showing that cross-communication between the epithelial and immune compartments is important for immune suppression in HGSC. These findings could have implications for the design of clinical trials with immune-modulating drugs.",Epigenetics,patients highgrade serous ovarian carcinoma hgsc usually diagnosed advancedstage disease tumors often immunosuppressive characteristics together factors important disease progression drug resistance mortality study used combination singlecell sequencing spatial transcriptomics identify molecular mechanisms lead immunosuppression hgsc primary tumors consistently showed active immune microenvironment omental tumors addition found untreated primary tumors mostly populated dysfunctional cd cd cells later stages differentiation turn correlated expression changes interferon pathways epithelial cells showing crosscommunication epithelial immune compartments important immune suppression hgsc findings could implications design clinical trials immunemodulating drugs,Epigenetics
"Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders and to predict as well as relate to treatment response. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) was performed at baseline (BL), post-treatment (POST) and 6-month follow-up (FU) in the so far largest longitudinal sample of patients with anxiety disorders (N = 415) treated with exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and in 315 healthy controls. Independent of comorbidity with depression, anxiety disorders were significantly (p ≤ 6.409E-08) associated with altered DNA methylation at 148 CpGs partly mapping to genes previously implicated in processes related to anxiety, brain disorders, learning or plasticity (e.g., GABBR2, GABRD, GAST, IL12RB2, LINC00293, LOC101928626, MFGE8, NOTCH4, PTPRN2, RIMBP2, SPTBN1) or in a recent cross-anxiety disorders EWAS (TAOK1) after pre-processing and quality control (N = 378 vs. N = 295). Furthermore, BL DNA methylation at seven and three CpGs, respectively, was suggestively (p < 1E-5) associated with treatment response at POST (ABCA7, ADRA2C, LTBR, RPSAP52, SH3RF3, SLC47A2, ZNF251) and FU (ADGRD1, PRSS58, USP47). Finally, suggestive evidence for dynamic epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes along with CBT response emerged at four CpGs from BL to FU (ADIPOR2, EIF3B, OCA2, TMCC1). The identification of epigenetic biomarkers may eventually aid in developing environment-based preventive strategies aimed at increasing resilience by providing deeper molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying anxiety disorders.

"DNA sequencing from bulk or clonal human tissues has shown that genetic mosaicism is common and contributes to both cancer and non-cancerous disorders. However, single-cell resolution is required to understand the full genetic heterogeneity that exists within a tissue and the mechanisms that lead to somatic mosaicism. Single-cell DNA-sequencing technologies have traditionally trailed behind those of single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, largely because most applications require whole-genome amplification before costly whole-genome sequencing. Now, recent technological and computational advances are enabling the use of single-cell DNA sequencing to tackle previously intractable problems, such as delineating the genetic landscape of tissues with complex clonal patterns, of samples where cellular material is scarce and of non-cycling, postmitotic cells. Single-cell genomes are also revealing the mutational patterns that arise from biological processes or disease states, and have made it possible to track cell lineage in human tissues.

"Anti-HER2 antibodies are effective but often lead to resistance in patients with HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we report an epigenetic crosstalk with aberrant glycerophospholipid metabolism and inflammation as a key resistance mechanism of anti-HER2 therapies in HER2+ breast cancer. Histone reader ZMYND8 specifically confers resistance to cancer cells against trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab. Mechanistically, ZMYND8 enhances cPLA2α expression in resistant tumor cells through inducing c-Myc. cPLA2α inactivates phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C to inhibit phosphatidylcholine breakdown into diacylglycerol, which diminishes protein kinase C activity leading to interleukin-27 secretion. Supplementation with interleukin-27 protein counteracts cPLA2α loss to reinforce trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ tumor cells and patient-derived organoids. Upregulation of ZMYND8, c-Myc, cPLA2α, and IL-27 is prevalent in HER2+ breast cancer patients following HER2-targeted therapies. Targeting c-Myc or cPLA2α effectively overcomes anti-HER2 therapy resistance in patient-derived xenografts.

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited gastrointestinal syndrome associated with duodenal adenoma formation. Even among carriers of the same genetic variant, duodenal phenotypes vary, indicating that additional factors, such as the local immune system, play a role. We observe an increase in duodenal IL-17A(+)NKp44(-) innate lymphoid type 3 cell (ILC3) in FAP, localized near the epithelium and enriched in adenomas and carcinomas. Elevated IL1B, IL23A, and DLL4 transcript levels correlate with IL-17A(+)NKp44(-)ILC3 accumulation, and in vitro studies with duodenal organoids confirmed this relationship. Bulk RNA sequencing reveals upregulated Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing enzymes DUOX2 and DUOXA2 in FAP adenomas. IL-17A-stimulated FAP organoids show increased DUOX2/DUOXA2 expression, Duox2 protein, and ROS production, leading to DNA damage, suggesting a mechanism by which these immune cells promote tumorigenesis.

"Enzalutamide, a second-generation androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, after a period of enzalutamide treatment, patients inevitably develop drug resistance. In this study, we characterized leucine-rich repeated G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) and explored its potential therapeutic value in prostate cancer. LGR5 was screened by sequencing data of enzalutamide-resistant cell lines combined with sequencing data of lesions with different Gleason scores from the same patients. The biological function of LGR5 and its effect on enzalutamide resistance were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays were used to explore the specific binding mechanism of LGR5 and related pathway changes. LGR5 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer and negatively correlated with poor patient prognosis. Overexpression of LGR5 promoted the malignant progression of prostate cancer and reduced sensitivity to enzalutamide in vitro and in vivo. LGR5 promoted the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) by binding heat shock protein 90,000 alpha B1 (HSP90AB1) and mediated the activation of the Wingless/integrated (WNT)/β-catenin signaling pathway. The increased β-catenin in the cytoplasm entered the nucleus and bound to the nuclear AR, promoting the transcription level of AR, which led to the enhanced tolerance of prostate cancer to enzalutamide. Reducing HSP90AB1 binding to LGR5 significantly enhanced sensitivity to enzalutamide. LGR5 directly binds to HSP90AB1 and mediates GSK-3β phosphorylation, promoting AR expression by regulating the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby conferring resistance to enzalutamide treatment in prostate cancer.",Epigenetics,enzalutamide secondgeneration androgen receptor ar pathway inhibitor widely used treatment castrationresistant prostate cancer however period enzalutamide treatment patients inevitably develop drug resistance study characterized leucinerich repeated gproteincoupled receptor lgr explored potential therapeutic value prostate cancer lgr screened sequencing data enzalutamideresistant cell lines combined sequencing data lesions different gleason scores patients biological function lgr effect enzalutamide resistance investigated vitro vivo glutathionestransferase gst pulldown coimmunoprecipitation western blotting immunofluorescence assays used explore specific binding mechanism lgr related pathway changes lgr significantly upregulated prostate cancer negatively correlated poor patient prognosis overexpression lgr promoted malignant progression prostate cancer reduced sensitivity enzalutamide vitro vivo lgr promoted phosphorylation glycogen synthase kinase gsk binding heat shock protein alpha b hspab mediated activation winglessintegrated wntcatenin signaling pathway increased catenin cytoplasm entered nucleus bound nuclear ar promoting transcription level ar led enhanced tolerance prostate cancer enzalutamide reducing hspab binding lgr significantly enhanced sensitivity enzalutamide lgr directly binds hspab mediates gsk phosphorylation promoting ar expression regulating wntcatenin signaling pathway thereby conferring resistance enzalutamide treatment prostate cancer,Epigenetics

"Work-related stress (WRS) is associated with the development of various health issues and long-term absence from the workplace. Adequate measurement of WRS is essential to assess its prevalence, risks, and effectiveness of preventive interventions. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of different categories of WRS assessment: 1) self-assessment, 2) external assessment, and 3) biomarkers. The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science have been searched until July 2024 for studies comprising self-assessment or external assessment of WRS, and WRS biomarkers. The self-assessment studies were further evaluated following the COSMIN guidelines. In this review, a total of 15,749 articles were screened. The final analysis included 53 studies on self-assessment of WRS, 33 articles on external assessment of WRS and 167 articles on stress biomarkers. Within self-assessment studies, four instruments were included in the analysis: Job Content Questionnaire, Effort Reward Imbalance Questionnaire, Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II and the Demand-Control-Support Questionnaire. The studies applying external assessment used job-exposure matrices, work register data, ethnography, digital tools, and external observation.

"Mitochondrial oxidative damage-mediated dysfunction is implicated in pulmonary pathogenesis, yet the molecular mechanisms linking redox imbalance to pulmonary fibrosis remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) drives fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrosis by epigenetically repressing superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a critical antioxidant enzyme. Using fibroblast-specific DNMT3A-deficient mice and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models, we observed that DNMT3A ablation significantly attenuated mitochondrial oxidant overproduction, restored mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reduced fibrotic progression. Mechanistically, DNMT3A directly bound to the SOD2 promoter, inducing hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing, which exacerbated oxidative stress and fibroblast proliferation. Conversely, AAV6-mediated SOD2 overexpression or DNMT3A knockdown rescued SOD2 expression, suppressed mitochondrial oxidative burden, and ameliorated fibrosis. Clinically, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patient tissues exhibited elevated DNMT3A levels, diminished SOD2 expression, and marked mitochondrial dysfunction, corroborating our experimental findings. These results unveil a novel DNMT3A/SOD2 axis as an epigenetic regulator of mitochondrial redox dysregulation-driven fibrosis, providing a potential therapeutic avenue for targeting oxidative damage in pulmonary fibrotic disorders.",Epigenetics,mitochondrial oxidative damagemediated dysfunction implicated pulmonary pathogenesis yet molecular mechanisms linking redox imbalance pulmonary fibrosis remain elusive study demonstrate dna methyltransferase dnmta drives fibroblast activation pulmonary fibrosis epigenetically repressing superoxide dismutase sod critical antioxidant enzyme using fibroblastspecific dnmtadeficient mice bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis models observed dnmta ablation significantly attenuated mitochondrial oxidant overproduction restored mitochondrial membrane potential mmp reduced fibrotic progression mechanistically dnmta directly bound sod promoter inducing hypermethylation transcriptional silencing exacerbated oxidative stress fibroblast proliferation conversely aavmediated sod overexpression dnmta knockdown rescued sod expression suppressed mitochondrial oxidative burden ameliorated fibrosis clinically idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf patient tissues exhibited elevated dnmta levels diminished sod expression marked mitochondrial dysfunction corroborating experimental findings results unveil novel dnmtasod axis epigenetic regulator mitochondrial redox dysregulationdriven fibrosis providing potential therapeutic avenue targeting oxidative damage pulmonary fibrotic disorders,Epigenetics
"This pilot study introduces the concept of a ""redox clock,"" an NRF2-based epigenetic clock that reflects age-related changes in oxidative stress regulation. We examined CpG methylation of the NRF2 promoter across two independent populations: 101 healthy participants (56 males, 45 females) from Gyeongsang National University Hospital (GNUH) and 150 healthy participants (111 males, 39 females) from the National Cancer Center (NCC). Methylation-sensitive HpaII restriction enzyme assays targeted three promoter regions (A, B, and C), while Illumina MethylationEPIC microarray analysis identified two specific CpG sites (cg03988329 and cg15484591) that correlated significantly with age (p < 0.01). Males, in particular, showed heightened CpG methylation in regions A and C with advancing age, alongside higher Ct values for NRF2 and HO-1 transcripts, indicating reduced gene expression. Using these methylation patterns, we developed the ""redox clock"" to model accelerated aging (AA). Notably, this redox clock discriminated prediagnostic lung cancer cases from healthy controls by revealing significantly greater AA in the cancer cohort, whereas established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge) did not detect this difference. These findings support CpG methylation of the NRF2 promoter, as captured by the redox clock, as a promising biomarker for biological aging and potential risk assessment for age-related diseases such as lung cancer.",Epigenetics,pilot study introduces concept redox clock nrfbased epigenetic clock reflects agerelated changes oxidative stress regulation examined cpg methylation nrf promoter across two independent populations healthy participants males females gyeongsang national university hospital gnuh healthy participants males females national cancer center ncc methylationsensitive hpaii restriction enzyme assays targeted three promoter regions b c illumina methylationepic microarray analysis identified two specific cpg sites cg cg correlated significantly age p males particular showed heightened cpg methylation regions c advancing age alongside higher ct values nrf ho transcripts indicating reduced gene expression using methylation patterns developed redox clock model accelerated aging aa notably redox clock discriminated prediagnostic lung cancer cases healthy controls revealing significantly greater aa cancer cohort whereas established epigenetic clocks horvath hannum phenoage detect difference findings support cpg methylation nrf promoter captured redox clock promising biomarker biological aging potential risk assessment agerelated diseases lung cancer,Epigenetics
"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children accounting for 7% of acute care visits and hospitalizations. In particular, neonates and infants have worse outcomes with HMPV infection. The neonatal immune system is regulated to favor anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic responses compared to adults, including prior work demonstrating epigenetic factors in neonatal CD4+ T cells promoting Th2 formation rather than antiviral Th1 differentiation. To interrogate the neonatal immune response to HMPV, 4-to-6 day-old mice or adult 6-to-8 week-old mice were infected with HMPV. Neonates had a decreased Th1 population and increased Th2 and regulatory T-cell (Treg) populations compared to adults. Neonatal Th1 function, but not cell number, was restrained by surface PD-1 expression. To assess if neonatal Th1 formation was intrinsically inhibited after HMPV, neonatal and adult CD4s were transferred into immunocompetent or immunodeficient neonates. Both adult and neonatal CD4s demonstrated reduced Th1 differentiation in the immunocompetent neonates, but robust Th1 differentiation in immunodeficient neonates and immunocompetent adults, suggesting an extrinsic mechanism. Loss of neonatal Tregs led to increased Th1 differentiation after HMPV infection. Neonatal Tregs had increased TGF-β production compared to adult Tregs, and disruption of TGF-β signaling increased Th1 induction.

"Double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC), characterized by an androgen receptor (AR)- and neuroendocrine-null phenotype, frequently emerges following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, our understanding of the origins and regulatory mechanisms of DNPC remains limited. Here, we discover that tumors with KMT2C mutation or loss are highly susceptible to transitioning into DNPC following ADT. We clarify that DNPC primarily stems from luminal cell transdifferentiation rather than basal cell transformation. Antiandrogen treatment induces KMT2C binding at enhancers of a subset of AR-regulated genes, preserving the adenocarcinoma lineage. KMT2C maintains ASPP2 expression via enhancer-promoter communication post-AR inhibition, while its inactivation reduces ASPP2, triggering ΔNp63-dependent transdifferentiation. This DNPC transition maintains fatty acid (FA) synthesis through ΔNp63-mediated SREBP1c transactivation, fueling DNPC growth via HRAS palmitoylation and MAPK signaling activation. These findings highlight KMT2C as an epigenetic checkpoint against DNPC development and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting fatty acid synthesis.",Epigenetics,doublenegative prostate cancer dnpc characterized androgen receptor ar neuroendocrinenull phenotype frequently emerges following androgen deprivation therapy adt however understanding origins regulatory mechanisms dnpc remains limited discover tumors kmtc mutation loss highly susceptible transitioning dnpc following adt clarify dnpc primarily stems luminal cell transdifferentiation rather basal cell transformation antiandrogen treatment induces kmtc binding enhancers subset arregulated genes preserving adenocarcinoma lineage kmtc maintains aspp expression via enhancerpromoter communication postar inhibition inactivation reduces aspp triggering npdependent transdifferentiation dnpc transition maintains fatty acid fa synthesis npmediated srebpc transactivation fueling dnpc growth via hras palmitoylation mapk signaling activation findings highlight kmtc epigenetic checkpoint dnpc development suggest therapeutic potential targeting fatty acid synthesis,Epigenetics
"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), induced by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, represents a highly contagious swine disease that causes substantial economic losses in the global pig industry. As the most prevalent RNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) has emerged as a crucial epitranscriptomic regulator of host-pathogen interactions, although its functional significance in PEDV-infected porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) remains to be fully elucidated. This study drew m6A maps before and after ALKBH5 interfering with IPEC-J2 cells, revealing the mechanism by which ALKBH5 mediated m<sup>6</sup>A regulates PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. This study employs an in vitro model of PEDV-induced IPEC-J2 cell damage to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of m6A methylation in host antiviral responses. Utilizing a comprehensive multi-omics approach, including MeRIP-seq, RNA-seq, qPCR, Western blot, MeRIP-qPCR, and RIP-qPCR, we systematically uncovered the critical role of m6A methylation in antiviral defense. Our findings reveal that ALKBH5, a key demethylase during PEDV infection, plays a pivotal role in modulating m6A modification levels. Specifically, gene silencing of ALKBH5 significantly upregulates m6A modification but downregulates expression of the antiviral effector genes IFIT3 and HERC5. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the YTHDC2 protein selectively recognizes m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites within IFIT3 and HERC5 transcripts, thereby mediating ALKBH5-dependent regulation of mRNA stability and protein expression. Functional analyses further reveal that IFIT3 activates the IRF3/TBK1 signaling axis, while HERC5 enhances antiviral responses by modulating the key effector molecule ISG15. Together, these findings establish a synergistic antiviral mechanism in IPEC-J2 cells. This study is the first to elucidate the novel ALKBH5-YTHDC2-m6A molecular axis, which orchestrates host antiviral immunity through a dual-pathway regulatory mode. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the role of RNA epigenetic modifications in enterovirus infections and offer a molecular basis for developing m6A-targeted strategies to prevent and control porcine infectious gastroenteritis.",Epigenetics,porcine epidemic diarrhea ped induced porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv infection represents highly contagious swine disease causes substantial economic losses global pig industry prevalent rna modification nmethyladenosine msupsupa emerged crucial epitranscriptomic regulator hostpathogen interactions although functional significance pedvinfected porcine intestinal epithelial cells ipecj remains fully elucidated study drew maps alkbh interfering ipecj cells revealing mechanism alkbh mediated msupsupa regulates pedv infection ipecj cells study employs vitro model pedvinduced ipecj cell damage investigate regulatory mechanisms methylation host antiviral responses utilizing comprehensive multiomics approach including meripseq rnaseq qpcr western blot meripqpcr ripqpcr systematically uncovered critical role methylation antiviral defense findings reveal alkbh key demethylase pedv infection plays pivotal role modulating modification levels specifically gene silencing alkbh significantly upregulates modification downregulates expression antiviral effector genes ifit herc mechanistically demonstrate ythdc protein selectively recognizes msupsupa modification sites within ifit herc transcripts thereby mediating alkbhdependent regulation mrna stability protein expression functional analyses reveal ifit activates irftbk signaling axis herc enhances antiviral responses modulating key effector molecule isg together findings establish synergistic antiviral mechanism ipecj cells study first elucidate novel alkbhythdcma molecular axis orchestrates host antiviral immunity dualpathway regulatory mode findings provide theoretical foundation understanding role rna epigenetic modifications enterovirus infections offer molecular basis developing matargeted strategies prevent control porcine infectious gastroenteritis,Epigenetics
"Decisions to split two or more phenotypic manifestations related to genetic variations within the same gene can be challenging, especially during the early stages of syndrome discovery. Genotype-based diagnostics with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches using next-generation phenotyping (NGP) and DNA methylation (DNAm) can be utilized to expedite syndrome delineation within a single gene. We utilized an expanded cohort of 56 patients (22 previously unpublished individuals) with truncating variants in the MN1 gene and attempted different methods to assess plausible strategies to objectively delineate phenotypic differences between the C-Terminal Truncation (CTT) and N-Terminal Truncation (NTT) groups. This involved transcriptomics analysis on available patient fibroblast samples and AI-assisted approaches, including a new statistical method of GestaltMatcher on facial photos and blood DNAm analysis using a support vector machine (SVM) model. RNA-seq analysis was unable to show a significant difference in transcript expression despite our previous hypothesis that NTT variants would induce nonsense mediated decay. DNAm analysis on nine blood DNA samples revealed an episignature for the CTT group. In parallel, the new statistical method of GestaltMatcher objectively distinguished the CTT and NTT groups with a low requirement for cohort number. Validation of this approach was performed on syndromes with known DNAm signatures of SRCAP, SMARCA2 and ADNP to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. We demonstrate the potential of using AI-based technologies to leverage genotype, phenotype and epigenetics data in facilitating splitting decisions in diagnosis of syndromes with minimal sample requirement.

"Isolated environments such as islands can provide restricted dietary resources of varying quality. This has a major impact on evolution of island species, and can lead to rapid morphological adaptation, especially in small mammals. In order to understand the impact of diet quality on the masticatory apparatus in the model species Mus musculus domesticus, we quantitatively analyzed the main masticatory muscles and the mandibular morphology in semi-natural populations kept on different diets for six generations. The investigation of individuals of the F5 generation raised on high quality (HQ) or standard quality (SQ) diets revealed significantly higher muscle mass and larger anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) of the M. masseter and the M. temporalis in mice raised on SQ diet as compared to HQ diet. A trend towards more robust (i.e., sturdy) mandible morphology in SQ mice as compared to HQ mice was evident. The investigation of individuals of two F6 generations which were fed on a diet different from that of the preceding generation revealed that the diet switch from HQ to SQ resulted in increased muscle size, whereas the diet switch from SQ to HQ lead to decreased muscle size as compared to the respective control group. The mandible displayed limited differences in morphology. These findings suggest that within six generations, diet quality could be a selection factor for morphological traits in the mandible which may become epigenetically fixed. However, additional studies such as DNA methylation and histone modification are necessary to unravel the role of the epigenome in this context.",Epigenetics,isolated environments islands provide restricted dietary resources varying quality major impact evolution island species lead rapid morphological adaptation especially small mammals order understand impact diet quality masticatory apparatus model species mus musculus domesticus quantitatively analyzed main masticatory muscles mandibular morphology seminatural populations kept different diets six generations investigation individuals f generation raised high quality hq standard quality sq diets revealed significantly higher muscle mass larger anatomical crosssectional area acsa masseter temporalis mice raised sq diet compared hq diet trend towards robust ie sturdy mandible morphology sq mice compared hq mice evident investigation individuals two f generations fed diet different preceding generation revealed diet switch hq sq resulted increased muscle size whereas diet switch sq hq lead decreased muscle size compared respective control group mandible displayed limited differences morphology findings suggest within six generations diet quality could selection factor morphological traits mandible may become epigenetically fixed however additional studies dna methylation histone modification necessary unravel role epigenome context,Epigenetics
"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that infects more than 90% of the world's population and is implicated in various diseases, including lymphoproliferative and neoplastic disorders. Recently, evidence has suggested a strong association between EBV and multiple sclerosis (MS). Although EBV infection is common, only a minority of carriers develop MS, indicating the influence of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms through which EBV might influence the development of MS. One mechanism discussed is molecular mimicry, where the similarity between EBV viral antigens and central nervous system proteins could induce a cross-reactive autoimmune response. Additionally, the mechanisms by which EBV evades the immune response are reviewed, including the expression of proteins such as EBNA1 and EBNA2, which interfere with the function of T and NK cells. Genetic factors, such as the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele, a principal risk factor for MS, are also reviewed. This allele acts as a co-receptor facilitating the infection of B cells by EBV, which could explain the increased susceptibility to MS in individuals with this allele. Furthermore, EBV may alter the epigenetic regulation of genes associated with MS, affecting the expression of key genes in immune response and inflammation. Finally, immunotherapies targeting EBV, such as those based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are discussed.",Epigenetics,epsteinbarr virus ebv herpesvirus infects worlds population implicated various diseases including lymphoproliferative neoplastic disorders recently evidence suggested strong association ebv multiple sclerosis ms although ebv infection common minority carriers develop ms indicating influence genetic environmental factors pathogenesis article reviews molecular mechanisms ebv might influence development ms one mechanism discussed molecular mimicry similarity ebv viral antigens central nervous system proteins could induce crossreactive autoimmune response additionally mechanisms ebv evades immune response reviewed including expression proteins ebna ebna interfere function nk cells genetic factors hladrb allele principal risk factor ms also reviewed allele acts coreceptor facilitating infection b cells ebv could explain increased susceptibility ms individuals allele furthermore ebv may alter epigenetic regulation genes associated ms affecting expression key genes immune response inflammation finally immunotherapies targeting ebv based cytotoxic lymphocytes discussed,Epigenetics
"The current noninvasive prognostic evaluation methods for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are largely reliant on radiographic imaging features and serum biomarkers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), have limited effectiveness in discriminating patient outcomes. Identification of new prognostic biomarkers is a critical unmet need to improve treatment decision-making. Epigenetic changes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have shown promise in early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, we aim to evaluate the potential of cfDNA methylation as a noninvasive predictor for prognostication in patients with active, radiographically viable HCC. Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array data of 377 HCC tumors and 50 adjacent normal tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified 158 HCC-related DNA methylation markers associated with overall survival (OS). This signature was further validated in 29 HCC tumor tissue samples. Subsequently, we applied the signature to an independent cohort of 52 patients with plasma cfDNA samples by calculating the cfDNA methylation-based risk score (methRisk) via random survival forest models with 10-fold cross-validation for the prognostication of OS. The cfDNA-based methRisk showed strong discriminatory power when evaluated as a single predictor for OS (3-year AUC = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94). Integrating the methRisk with existing risk indices like Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging significantly improved the noninvasive prognostic assessments for OS (3-year AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80-1), and methRisk remained an independent predictor of survival in the multivariate Cox model (P = 0.007). Our study serves as a pilot study demonstrating that cfDNA methylation biomarkers assessed from a peripheral blood draw can stratify HCC patients into clinically meaningful risk groups. These findings indicate that cfDNA methylation is a promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker for HCC, providing a proof-of-concept for its potential clinical utility and laying the groundwork for broader applications.",Epigenetics,current noninvasive prognostic evaluation methods hepatocellular carcinoma hcc largely reliant radiographic imaging features serum biomarkers alphafetoprotein afp limited effectiveness discriminating patient outcomes identification new prognostic biomarkers critical unmet need improve treatment decisionmaking epigenetic changes cellfree dna cfdna shown promise early cancer diagnosis prognosis thus aim evaluate potential cfdna methylation noninvasive predictor prognostication patients active radiographically viable hcc using illumina humanmethylation array data hcc tumors adjacent normal tissues obtained cancer genome atlas tcga identified hccrelated dna methylation markers associated overall survival os signature validated hcc tumor tissue samples subsequently applied signature independent cohort patients plasma cfdna samples calculating cfdna methylationbased risk score methrisk via random survival forest models fold crossvalidation prognostication os cfdnabased methrisk showed strong discriminatory power evaluated single predictor os year auc ci integrating methrisk existing risk indices like barcelona clinic liver cancer bclc staging significantly improved noninvasive prognostic assessments os year auc ci methrisk remained independent predictor survival multivariate cox model p study serves pilot study demonstrating cfdna methylation biomarkers assessed peripheral blood draw stratify hcc patients clinically meaningful risk groups findings indicate cfdna methylation promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker hcc providing proofofconcept potential clinical utility laying groundwork broader applications,Epigenetics
"There has been an increasing effort to understand the memory responses of a complex interplay among innate, adaptive, and structural cells in peripheral organs and bone marrow. Trained immunity is coined as the de facto memory of innate immune cells and their progenitors. These cells acquire epigenetic modifications and shift their metabolism to equip an imprinted signature to a persistent fast-responsive functional state. Recent studies highlight the contribution of noncoding RNAs and modulation of chromatin structures in establishing this epigenetic readiness for potential immune perturbations. In this review, we discuss recent studies that highlight trained immunity-mediated memory responses emerging intrinsically in innate immune cells and as a complex interplay with other cells at the organ level. Lastly, we survey epigenetic contributors to trained immunity phenotypes-specifically, a recently discovered regulatory circuit coordinating the regulation of a key driver of trained immunity.",Epigenetics,increasing effort understand memory responses complex interplay among innate adaptive structural cells peripheral organs bone marrow trained immunity coined de facto memory innate immune cells progenitors cells acquire epigenetic modifications shift metabolism equip imprinted signature persistent fastresponsive functional state recent studies highlight contribution noncoding rnas modulation chromatin structures establishing epigenetic readiness potential immune perturbations review discuss recent studies highlight trained immunitymediated memory responses emerging intrinsically innate immune cells complex interplay cells organ level lastly survey epigenetic contributors trained immunity phenotypesspecifically recently discovered regulatory circuit coordinating regulation key driver trained immunity,Epigenetics
"CD8 T cells play a critical role in antitumor immunity. However, over time, they often become dysfunctional or exhausted and ultimately fail to control tumor growth. To effectively harness CD8 T cells for cancer immunotherapy, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that govern their differentiation and function is crucial. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the molecular pathways that regulate CD8 T cell heterogeneity and function in chronic infection and cancer and outlines how T cells respond to therapeutic checkpoint blockade. We explore how T cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors influence CD8 T cell differentiation, fate choices, and functional states and ultimately dictate their response to therapy.

"Leucine-rich repeat containing 25 (LRRC25), a type I membrane protein, is specifically expressed in myeloid cells including neutrophils and macrophages. The anti-inflammatory role of LRRC25 was suggested in a few pathogenic models. However, its role in cancer immunity has not been interrogated. Here, we demonstrate that LRRC25 is robustly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Lrrc25 deficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME) suppresses growth of multiple murine tumor models by reprogramming TAMs toward an anti-tumor phenotype and thereby enhancing infiltration and activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The Nox2-ROS-Nlrp3-Il1β pathway is elevated in Lrrc25-deficient TAMs. Furthermore, a human myeloid cell line or mice with loss of Lrrc25 appear normal, indicating that LRRC25 is a safe immune target.

"Maize (Zea mays L.), a cornerstone of global food security, faces significant challenges due to drought stress, which disrupts its growth, development, and productivity. This review synthesizes advances in our understanding of drought stress memory, a mechanism that enables maize to ""remember"" prior drought exposure through transcriptional, epigenetic, and physiological pathways. Key regulators, including transcription factors (ZmEREB24 and ZmNF-YC12) and epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation and histone acetylation), orchestrate stress-responsive pathways that ensure rapid adaptation to recurrent drought events. Complementing these molecular mechanisms, physiological adaptations, such as optimized root and leaf architecture, enhanced water-use efficiency, and antioxidant defenses, further strengthen drought tolerance. Practical applications, including molecular priming techniques (e.g., osmopriming, hydropriming, nanoparticles) and advanced genetic tools (CRISPR/Cas9, GWAS), promise scalable solutions for breeding drought-resilient maize varieties. Despite this progress, challenges remain, including genotype-specific variability, scalability, and trade-offs between resilience and yield.

"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are synthetic halogen compounds, industrially used as flame retardants in many flammable products. PBDEs are environmentally persistent and bioaccumulative substances that were used from the 1970s and discontinued in the 1990s. PBDEs are present in air, soil, water, and food, where they remain stable for a long time. Chronic exposure to PBDEs is associated with adverse human health effects, including cancer, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, reproductive and metabolic disorders, motor and hormonal impairments, and neurotoxicity, especially in children. It has been demonstrated that PBDE exposure can cause mitochondrial and DNA damage, apoptosis, oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and changes in calcium and neurotransmitter levels. Here, we conduct a comprehensive review of the molecular mechanisms of the neurotoxicity of PBDEs using different approaches. We discuss the main neurotransmitter pathways affected by exposure to PBDEs in vitro and in vivo in different mammalian models. Excitatory and inhibitory signaling pathways are the putative target where PBDEs carry out their neurotoxicity. Based on this evidence, environmental PBDEs are considered a risk to human public health and a hazard to biota, underscoring the need for environmental monitoring to mitigate exposure to PBDEs.",Epigenetics,polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes synthetic halogen compounds industrially used flame retardants many flammable products pbdes environmentally persistent bioaccumulative substances used discontinued pbdes present air soil water food remain stable long time chronic exposure pbdes associated adverse human health effects including cancer immunotoxicity hepatotoxicity reproductive metabolic disorders motor hormonal impairments neurotoxicity especially children demonstrated pbde exposure cause mitochondrial dna damage apoptosis oxidative stress epigenetic modifications changes calcium neurotransmitter levels conduct comprehensive review molecular mechanisms neurotoxicity pbdes using different approaches discuss main neurotransmitter pathways affected exposure pbdes vitro vivo different mammalian models excitatory inhibitory signaling pathways putative target pbdes carry neurotoxicity based evidence environmental pbdes considered risk human public health hazard biota underscoring need environmental monitoring mitigate exposure pbdes,Epigenetics
"Metformin disinfection byproducts Y and C have emerged as pollutants of concern in drinking water systems and are suspected to possess significant toxicity to mammals. However, effective strategies to mitigate the effects of Y and C exposure in mammals have not been thoroughly formulated. This study aimed to investigate the toxicity and characteristic phenotypes of short-term, high-dose exposure to Y and C in the intestine and liver of mice and to evaluate the protective effects of <i>Dictyophora rubrovolvata</i> extract (DRE) on Y- and C-induced intestinal and liver damage. The results showed that exposure-induced intestinal toxicity manifested mainly as intestinal barrier dysfunction, induction of immune response and oxidative stress, and disruption of intestinal flora homeostasis. Hepatotoxicity was mainly characterized by histopathological changes such as vacuolar degeneration, abnormal liver function, and oxidative stress. Additionally, marked changes in gut microbiota and biochemical indicators were closely related to hepatic and intestinal injuries after exposure. DRE effectively alleviated Y- and C-induced intestinal and liver damage, reshaped the gut microbiota, and maintained gut-liver axis homeostasis.

"Benzo[a]pyrene, as the primary component of air pollutants, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As an m6A reader that facilitates mRNA translation, YTHDF1 serves as a crucial regulator in tumor progression. Therefore, we established Benzo[a]pyrene(B[a]P)-induced bronchial epithelial malignant transformed cells (HBE-P35) to simulate the precancerous lesions of NSCLC and investigated the regulatory axis of YTHDF1 in both HBE-P35 and A549 lung cancer cells. A high level of m6A expression was detected in both HBE-P35 and A549 cells. Over-expression of YTHDF1 was observed in NSCLC tissues and correlated with poor overall survival in NSCLC patients. TMT labeling-based proteomic analysis and clinical lung tissue microarray assays demonstrated that CDK6 and MAP3K6 were positively correlated with YTHDF1 expression. MeRIP and RIP analyses revealed that YTHDF1 mediates the m6A-dependent regulation of CDK6 and MAP3K6 protein expression. The acquisition and deletion of miR-139/145-5p, along with luciferase reporter gene assays, demonstrated that miR-139-5p can target YTHDF1. Therefore, we conclude that YTHDF1 regulates CDK6 and MAP3K6 through m6A in B[a]P-induced HBE-P35 and A549 cells, providing a potential target for lung cancer treatment.",Epigenetics,benzoapyrene primary component air pollutants implicated pathogenesis nonsmallcell lung cancer nsclc reader facilitates mrna translation ythdf serves crucial regulator tumor progression therefore established benzoapyrenebapinduced bronchial epithelial malignant transformed cells hbep simulate precancerous lesions nsclc investigated regulatory axis ythdf hbep lung cancer cells high level expression detected hbep cells overexpression ythdf observed nsclc tissues correlated poor overall survival nsclc patients tmt labelingbased proteomic analysis clinical lung tissue microarray assays demonstrated cdk mapk positively correlated ythdf expression merip rip analyses revealed ythdf mediates madependent regulation cdk mapk protein expression acquisition deletion mirp along luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated mirp target ythdf therefore conclude ythdf regulates cdk mapk bapinduced hbep cells providing potential target lung cancer treatment,Epigenetics
"Emerging research suggests that the intrauterine environment plays a critical role in predisposing individuals to metabolic syndrome (MetS), a constellation of conditions that heightens the risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Traditionally linked to lifestyle, the risk for MetS is now understood to be also influenced by fetal exposures. The environment in which a child lives offers abundant potential sources that can contribute to an increased risk of developing various diseases, and in some cases, these factors can be avoided. This review integrates findings from both epidemiological and experimental research to underscore the impact of prenatal factors, including maternal nutrition, obesity, gestational diabetes (GDM), and birth size, on the subsequent development of metabolic derangements in offspring, particularly during puberty. The progression of genetic and epigenetic studies has enlightened the pathophysiology of these conditions starting in the intrauterine period and continuing into early life.

"Numerous epidemiological studies indicate that populations exposed to environmental toxicants such as heavy metals have a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to those unexposed, indicating a potential association between heavy metals exposure and AD. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary mechanistic research exploring the associations of four important metals, arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), with AD and possible pathways, processes, and molecular mechanisms on the basis of data from the most recent mechanistic studies. Primary research publications published during the last decade were identified via a search of the PubMed Database. A thorough literature search and final screening yielded 45 original research articles for this review. Of the 45 research articles, 6 pertain to As, 9 to Mn, 21 to Pb, and 9 to Cd exposures and AD pathobiology. Environmental exposure to these heavy metals induces a wide range of pathological processes that intersect with well-known mechanisms leading to AD, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, autophagy dysfunction, and tau hyperphosphorylation. While exposure to single metals shares some affected pathways, certain effects are unique to specific metals. For instance, Pb disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and mitochondrial functions and alters AD-related genes epigenetically. Cd triggers neuronal senescence via p53/p21/Rb. As disrupts nitric oxide (NO) signaling, cortical, and synaptic function. Mn causes glutamate excitotoxicity and dopamine neuron damage. Our review provides a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms showing how metals contribute to AD.

Yujinxiang) within 24 h post-inoculation (hpi). In addition, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing showed that genomic DNA methylation levels of muskmelon decreased by 6.15% at 24 hpi. Notably, CG sites exhibited a higher methylation level and the largest number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Moreover, 176 DMR-associated genes (DMGs) involved in the defense response, 134 DMGs in the ROS metabolic pathway, and 41 DMGs in phenylpropanoid metabolism were identified.

"Cellular senescence regulates aging, tissue maintenance, and disease progression through the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), a secretory profile of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling enzymes. While transient SASP aids wound healing, its chronic activation drives inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis. This review examines SASP's molecular regulation, dual roles in health and pathology, and therapeutic potential. The following two main strategies are explored: senescence clearance, which eliminates SASP-producing cells, and SASP modulation, which refines secretion to suppress inflammation while maintaining regenerative effects. Key pathways, including NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and cGAS-STING, are discussed alongside pharmacological, immunotherapeutic, gene-editing, and epigenetic interventions. SASP heterogeneity necessitates tissue-specific biomarkers for personalized therapies. Challenges include immune interactions, long-term safety, and ethical considerations. SASP modulation emerges as a promising strategy for aging, oncology, and tissue repair, with future advancements relying on multi-omics and AI-driven insights to optimize clinical outcomes.",Epigenetics,cellular senescence regulates aging tissue maintenance disease progression senescenceassociated secretory phenotype sasp secretory profile cytokines chemokines growth factors matrixremodeling enzymes transient sasp aids wound healing chronic activation drives inflammation fibrosis tumorigenesis review examines sasps molecular regulation dual roles health pathology therapeutic potential following two main strategies explored senescence clearance eliminates saspproducing cells sasp modulation refines secretion suppress inflammation maintaining regenerative effects key pathways including nfb cebp cgassting discussed alongside pharmacological immunotherapeutic geneediting epigenetic interventions sasp heterogeneity necessitates tissuespecific biomarkers personalized therapies challenges include immune interactions longterm safety ethical considerations sasp modulation emerges promising strategy aging oncology tissue repair future advancements relying multiomics aidriven insights optimize clinical outcomes,Epigenetics
"DNA methylation (DNAm) is a well-studied epigenetic mechanism implicated in environmentally induced phenotypes and phenotypic plasticity. However, few studies investigate the timescale of DNAm shifts. Thus, it is uncertain whether DNAm can change on timescales relevant for rapid phenotypic shifts, such as during the expression of short-term behavioural plasticity. DNAm could be especially reactive in the brain, potentially increasing its relevance for behavioural plasticity. Most research investigating neural changes in methylation has been conducted in mammalian systems, on isolated individuals, and using stressors that are less ecologically relevant, reducing their generalisability to other natural systems. We exposed pairs of male and female Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to alarm cue, conspecific skin extract that reliably induces anti-predator behaviour, or a control cue. Whole-genome bisulphite sequencing on whole brains at various time points following cue exposure (0.5, 1, 4, 24, and 72 h) allowed us to uncover the timescale of neural DNAm responses. Males and females both showed rapid shifts in DNAm in as little as 0.5 h. However, males and females differed in the time course of their responses: both sexes showed a peak in the number of loci showing significant responses at 4 h, but males showed an additional peak at 72 h. We suggest that this finding could be due to the differing longer-term plastic responses between the sexes. This study shows that DNAm can be rapidly induced by an ecologically relevant stressor in fish and suggests that DNAm could be involved in short-term behavioural plasticity.",Epigenetics,dna methylation dnam wellstudied epigenetic mechanism implicated environmentally induced phenotypes phenotypic plasticity however studies investigate timescale dnam shifts thus uncertain whether dnam change timescales relevant rapid phenotypic shifts expression shortterm behavioural plasticity dnam could especially reactive brain potentially increasing relevance behavioural plasticity research investigating neural changes methylation conducted mammalian systems isolated individuals using stressors less ecologically relevant reducing generalisability natural systems exposed pairs male female trinidadian guppies poecilia reticulata alarm cue conspecific skin extract reliably induces antipredator behaviour control cue wholegenome bisulphite sequencing whole brains various time points following cue exposure h allowed us uncover timescale neural dnam responses males females showed rapid shifts dnam little h however males females differed time course responses sexes showed peak number loci showing significant responses h males showed additional peak h suggest finding could due differing longerterm plastic responses sexes study shows dnam rapidly induced ecologically relevant stressor fish suggests dnam could involved shortterm behavioural plasticity,Epigenetics
"Environmental and lifestyle factors significantly contribute to gynecological cancers. The risk of ovarian cancer, one the most lethal gynecological cancer, is associated with obesity, poor dietary habits, and environmental pollutants, exacerbating hormonal imbalances, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Protective factors, such as the Mediterranean diet and oral contraceptives, modulate risk by reducing ovulatory cycles, particularly in genetically predisposed women. Uterine cancer is associated with metabolic factors, with obesity driving hormonal disruptions and systemic inflammation. Physical inactivity and diets rich in animal fats increase the risk of endometrial cancer, along with air pollution and microbiome imbalances contribute to endometrial carcinogenesis. Cervical cancer is primarily driven by persistent high-risk HPV infection, with smoking enhancing viral persistence and oncogenesis. Nutritional deficiencies in antioxidants and folate weaken immune defenses, while vaginal and gut microbiome dysbiosis fosters neoplastic progression. Vulvar and vaginal cancers, though less common, share risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and occupational exposures, disrupting immune responses and epithelial integrity. Microbial imbalances exacerbate these malignancies, creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The interplay between modifiable factors and genetic predisposition, including high-penetrance mutations and polygenic risk scores, highlights the complexity complexity of prevention of gynecological cancers. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, further modulate susceptibility and tumor progression, influenced by environmental and lifestyle exposures. In addition, promoting and supporting healthy lifestyle changes, including smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and a balanced diet, are crucial for improving long-term outcomes and quality of life in gynecological cancer survivors. Addressing these factors through personalized prevention, leveraging predictive models incorporating genetics and modifiable risks, enables tailored lifestyle interventions and avoidance of environmental exposures. Combined with equitable public health initiatives, these strategies have the potential to reduce the burden of gynecological cancers and improve women's health globally.",Epigenetics,environmental lifestyle factors significantly contribute gynecological cancers risk ovarian cancer one lethal gynecological cancer associated obesity poor dietary habits environmental pollutants exacerbating hormonal imbalances inflammation oxidative stress protective factors mediterranean diet oral contraceptives modulate risk reducing ovulatory cycles particularly genetically predisposed women uterine cancer associated metabolic factors obesity driving hormonal disruptions systemic inflammation physical inactivity diets rich animal fats increase risk endometrial cancer along air pollution microbiome imbalances contribute endometrial carcinogenesis cervical cancer primarily driven persistent highrisk hpv infection smoking enhancing viral persistence oncogenesis nutritional deficiencies antioxidants folate weaken immune defenses vaginal gut microbiome dysbiosis fosters neoplastic progression vulvar vaginal cancers though less common share risk factors obesity smoking occupational exposures disrupting immune responses epithelial integrity microbial imbalances exacerbate malignancies creating proinflammatory microenvironment interplay modifiable factors genetic predisposition including highpenetrance mutations polygenic risk scores highlights complexity complexity prevention gynecological cancers epigenetic mechanisms dna methylation histone modifications modulate susceptibility tumor progression influenced environmental lifestyle exposures addition promoting supporting healthy lifestyle changes including smoking cessation increased physical activity balanced diet crucial improving longterm outcomes quality life gynecological cancer survivors addressing factors personalized prevention leveraging predictive models incorporating genetics modifiable risks enables tailored lifestyle interventions avoidance environmental exposures combined equitable public health initiatives strategies potential reduce burden gynecological cancers improve womens health globally,Epigenetics
"Among the major classes of RNAs in the cell, tRNAs remain the most difficult to characterize via deep sequencing approaches, as tRNA structure and nucleotide modifications can each interfere with cDNA synthesis by commonly-used reverse transcriptases (RTs). Here, we benchmark a recently-developed RNA cloning protocol, termed Ordered Two-Template Relay (OTTR), to characterize intact tRNAs and tRNA fragments in budding yeast and in mouse tissues. We show that OTTR successfully captures both full-length tRNAs and tRNA fragments in budding yeast and in mouse reproductive tissues without any prior enzymatic treatment, and that tRNA cloning efficiency can be further enhanced via AlkB-mediated demethylation of modified nucleotides. As with other recent tRNA cloning protocols, we find that a subset of nucleotide modifications leave misincorporation signatures in OTTR datasets, enabling their detection without any additional protocol steps. Focusing on tRNA cleavage products, we compare OTTR with several standard small RNA-Seq protocols, finding that OTTR provides the most accurate picture of tRNA fragment levels by comparison to ""ground truth"" Northern blots. Applying this protocol to mature mouse spermatozoa, our data dramatically alter our understanding of the small RNA cargo of mature mammalian sperm, revealing a far more complex population of tRNA fragments - including both 5' and 3' tRNA halves derived from the majority of tRNAs - than previously appreciated. Taken together, our data confirm the superior performance of OTTR to commercial protocols in analysis of tRNA fragments, and force a reappraisal of potential epigenetic functions of the sperm small RNA payload.",Epigenetics,among major classes rnas cell trnas remain difficult characterize via deep sequencing approaches trna structure nucleotide modifications interfere cdna synthesis commonlyused reverse transcriptases rts benchmark recentlydeveloped rna cloning protocol termed ordered twotemplate relay ottr characterize intact trnas trna fragments budding yeast mouse tissues show ottr successfully captures fulllength trnas trna fragments budding yeast mouse reproductive tissues without prior enzymatic treatment trna cloning efficiency enhanced via alkbmediated demethylation modified nucleotides recent trna cloning protocols find subset nucleotide modifications leave misincorporation signatures ottr datasets enabling detection without additional protocol steps focusing trna cleavage products compare ottr several standard small rnaseq protocols finding ottr provides accurate picture trna fragment levels comparison ground truth northern blots applying protocol mature mouse spermatozoa data dramatically alter understanding small rna cargo mature mammalian sperm revealing far complex population trna fragments including trna halves derived majority trnas previously appreciated taken together data confirm superior performance ottr commercial protocols analysis trna fragments force reappraisal potential epigenetic functions sperm small rna payload,Epigenetics
"Dihydroquercetin (DHQ), also known as taxifolin, is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound that serves as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. It is commercially available in the form of dietary supplements. As the reduced form of quercetin, DHQ contains five phenolic hydroxyl groups. This compound is capable of chelating transition metal ions, thereby effectively scavenging free radicals and detoxifying harmful substances while modulating enzyme activities. Consequently, DHQ exhibits potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial properties. Given its significant pharmacological potential, DHQ exhibits anti-tumor activity against various malignant tumors, including breast cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colonic neoplasms, melanoma, and prostate cancer. DHQ inhibits tumor occurrence and progression by regulating multiple signaling pathways, such as wnt/β-catenin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- κB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The anti-tumor mechanisms of DHQ include inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration; induction of cell cycle arrest, activation of autophagy, apoptosis, epigenetic modification, suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy, and augmentation of immune function. In particular, DHQ potentiates the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs and augments immune function. Based on a systematic review of the pharmacological properties and anti-tumor mechanisms of DHQ across multiple malignant tumors, we conclude DHQ to be a promising natural compound with significant potential for anti-tumor therapy.",Epigenetics,dihydroquercetin dhq also known taxifolin naturally occurring flavonoid compound serves active pharmaceutical ingredient commercially available form dietary supplements reduced form quercetin dhq contains five phenolic hydroxyl groups compound capable chelating transition metal ions thereby effectively scavenging free radicals detoxifying harmful substances modulating enzyme activities consequently dhq exhibits potent antioxidant antiinflammatory antiviral antibacterial properties given significant pharmacological potential dhq exhibits antitumor activity various malignant tumors including breast cancer gastric cancer hepatocellular carcinoma colonic neoplasms melanoma prostate cancer dhq inhibits tumor occurrence progression regulating multiple signaling pathways wntcatenin phosphoinositide kinase pikprotein kinase b akt mammalian target rapamycin mtor transforming growth factorbeta tgf nuclear factor kappalightchainenhancer activated b cells nf b mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk antitumor mechanisms dhq include inhibition cell proliferation invasion migration induction cell cycle arrest activation autophagy apoptosis epigenetic modification suppression epithelialmesenchymal transition emt enhancement chemotherapy efficacy augmentation immune function particular dhq potentiates efficacy chemotherapy drugs augments immune function based systematic review pharmacological properties antitumor mechanisms dhq across multiple malignant tumors conclude dhq promising natural compound significant potential antitumor therapy,Epigenetics
"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a prevalent pediatric solid malignancy associated with significant morbidity and mortality, largely driven by epigenetic alterations. This review aims to identify novel biomarkers related to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and DNA methylation in NB to enhance prognostic capabilities. We conducted a detailed analysis of the interplay between lncRNAs and DNA methylation in NB, focusing on regulatory variations and their implications for disease progression. Key lncRNAs, including GTL2/MEG3, DALI, NBAT-1, and DLX6-AS1, were examined for their regulation by DNA methylation through cis- and trans-methylation mechanisms. There are clinical and biological implications of lncRNAs in NB and related cancers. Notably, GTL2 and its alias MEG3 are implicated in tumorigenesis through epigenetic modifications, such as hypermethylation, leading to the loss of gene expression and aggressive tumor behavior. Similarly, the interactions of DALI with adjacent genes illustrate the crucial role lncRNAs play in neuronal differentiation and tumor progression, suggesting their potential to impact prognosis through regulatory effects. Furthermore, NBAT-1 emerges as a promising tumor suppressor with strong correlations to NB prognosis, where its methylation-induced silencing is associated with negative outcomes. DLX6-AS1 is also linked to increased NB risk, with expression patterns correlating to disease stage and survival rates; however, more extensive survival data are required to establish its prognostic value. This review highlights the potential of lncRNAs as prognostic indicators in NB, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate their roles and validate them as biomarkers for improved patient outcomes.",Epigenetics,neuroblastoma nb prevalent pediatric solid malignancy associated significant morbidity mortality largely driven epigenetic alterations review aims identify novel biomarkers related long noncoding rnas lncrnas dna methylation nb enhance prognostic capabilities conducted detailed analysis interplay lncrnas dna methylation nb focusing regulatory variations implications disease progression key lncrnas including gtlmeg dali nbat dlxas examined regulation dna methylation cis transmethylation mechanisms clinical biological implications lncrnas nb related cancers notably gtl alias meg implicated tumorigenesis epigenetic modifications hypermethylation leading loss gene expression aggressive tumor behavior similarly interactions dali adjacent genes illustrate crucial role lncrnas play neuronal differentiation tumor progression suggesting potential impact prognosis regulatory effects furthermore nbat emerges promising tumor suppressor strong correlations nb prognosis methylationinduced silencing associated negative outcomes dlxas also linked increased nb risk expression patterns correlating disease stage survival rates however extensive survival data required establish prognostic value review highlights potential lncrnas prognostic indicators nb emphasizing need research elucidate roles validate biomarkers improved patient outcomes,Epigenetics
"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), an enzyme integral to DNA repair and redox signaling, is notably upregulated in LUAD. Here we reveal that APE1 amplification, primarily via allele duplication, strongly correlates with poor prognosis in LUAD patients. Using human LUAD cell lines and a <i>KRAS</i>-driven mouse model, we showed that <i>APE1</i> deletion hampered cell proliferation and tumor growth, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, APE1 promoted the transcription of urea cycle genes <i>CPS1</i> and <i>ARG2</i> by modulating the presence of G-quadruplex (G4) structures in their promoter regions. APE1 loss disrupted the urea cycle and pyrimidine metabolism, inducing metabolic reprogramming and growth arrest, which could be rescued by CPS1 or pyrimidine restoration. These findings uncover APE1's role in transcriptional regulation of urea cycle metabolic reprogramming via G4 structure, providing a potential therapeutic target LUAD patients with elevated APE1 expression.",Epigenetics,lung adenocarcinoma luad remains leading cause cancer deaths worldwide apurinicapyrimidinic endonuclease ape enzyme integral dna repair redox signaling notably upregulated luad reveal ape amplification primarily via allele duplication strongly correlates poor prognosis luad patients using human luad cell lines ikrasidriven mouse model showed iapei deletion hampered cell proliferation tumor growth highlighting role tumorigenesis mechanistically ape promoted transcription urea cycle genes icpsi iargi modulating presence gquadruplex g structures promoter regions ape loss disrupted urea cycle pyrimidine metabolism inducing metabolic reprogramming growth arrest could rescued cps pyrimidine restoration findings uncover apes role transcriptional regulation urea cycle metabolic reprogramming via g structure providing potential therapeutic target luad patients elevated ape expression,Epigenetics
"5-Methylcytosine (5mC) is a crucial epigenetic modification in the mammalian genome, primarily occurring at CG dinucleotides. Accurate localization of 5mC is essential for understanding its functional significance. In this study, we discovered a novel DNA methyltransferase, designated M.MedI, from the bacterium <i>Mycoplasmopsis edwardii</i>. M.MedI exhibits carboxymethylation activity towards cytosines in CG sites in DNA. We further engineered a variant of M.MedI by mutating its critical active site residue 377 asparagine (N) to lysine (K), resulting in M.MedI-N377K. This engineered M.MedI-N377K enzyme demonstrated superior carboxymethylation activity towards cytosines in CG sites in both unmethylated and hemi-methylated DNA. Utilizing the newly identified M.MedI-N377K methyltransferase, we developed a novel method, engineered DNA methyltransferase-mediated carboxymethylation deamination sequencing (CMD-seq), for the stoichiometric detection of 5mC in DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. In CMD-seq, M.MedI-N377K efficiently transfers a carboxymethyl group to cytosines in CG sites in the presence of carboxy-<i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-methionine (caSAM), generating 5-carboxymethylcytosine (5camC). Subsequent treatment with the deaminase A3A deaminates 5mC to form thymine (T), which pairs with adenine (A) and is read as T, while 5camC remains unchanged, pairing with guanine (G) and being read as cytosine (C) during sequencing. We successfully applied CMD-seq to quantify 5mC sites in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes <i>RASSF1A</i> and <i>SHOX2</i> in human lung cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue. The quantification results were highly comparable to those obtained using traditional bisulfite sequencing. Overall, CMD-seq provides a valuable tool for bisulfite-free, single-nucleotide resolution, and quantitative detection of 5mC in limited DNA samples.",Epigenetics,methylcytosine mc crucial epigenetic modification mammalian genome primarily occurring cg dinucleotides accurate localization mc essential understanding functional significance study discovered novel dna methyltransferase designated mmedi bacterium imycoplasmopsis edwardiii mmedi exhibits carboxymethylation activity towards cytosines cg sites dna engineered variant mmedi mutating critical active site residue asparagine n lysine k resulting mmedink engineered mmedink enzyme demonstrated superior carboxymethylation activity towards cytosines cg sites unmethylated hemimethylated dna utilizing newly identified mmedink methyltransferase developed novel method engineered dna methyltransferasemediated carboxymethylation deamination sequencing cmdseq stoichiometric detection mc dna singlenucleotide resolution cmdseq mmedink efficiently transfers carboxymethyl group cytosines cg sites presence carboxyisiadenosyllmethionine casam generating carboxymethylcytosine camc subsequent treatment deaminase aa deaminates mc form thymine pairs adenine read camc remains unchanged pairing guanine g read cytosine c sequencing successfully applied cmdseq quantify mc sites promoters tumor suppressor genes irassfai ishoxi human lung cancer tissue adjacent normal tissue quantification results highly comparable obtained using traditional bisulfite sequencing overall cmdseq provides valuable tool bisulfitefree singlenucleotide resolution quantitative detection mc limited dna samples,Epigenetics
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social interaction deficits, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. The co-occurrence of motor impairments exacerbates the severity and societal impact of ASD, but the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Research on the comorbidities of ASD including motor impairments could benefit in the life quality improvement in patients with ASD. Here we aimed at investigating the motor behaviors in mice with <i>Trio</i> deletion in Purkinje cells (PCs), and further exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms. The protein level of Calbindin as PCs' marker was determined. Behaviors including spontaneous locomotion activity, rotarod, beam balance and gait were tested in mice with the ages of 12-week and 20-week. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with T2 and DTI sequencing was performed in 12-week old mice. Although <i>Trio<sup>fl/fl; Pcp2-Cre</sup></i> mice showed significant impairments of spontaneous locomotion activity in both 12-week and 20-week ages, only the 20-week but not 12-week <i>Trio<sup>fl/fl; Pcp2-Cre</sup></i> mice showed extra mild abnormal motor, fine motor coordination, and gait. The decreased expression of Calbindin existed in both 12-week and 20-week old mice compared with control.

"Seed dormancy allows seeds to remain dormant until the environmental conditions are ideal for germination. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying seed dormancy is essential for improving grain quality and preventing pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), a major challenge in globe agriculture. Here, we address how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the regulation of seed dormancy in rice (Oryza sativa). We identified a lncRNA, VIVIpary, that is specifically expressed in embryos and is associated with shortened seed dormancy. VIVIpary exhibits elevated expression level in the PHS sensitive variety, and its overexpression induces PHS, whereas its knockdown delays germination. Mechanically, VIVIpary promotes the release of seed dormancy by regulating abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. VIVIpary serves as a spatial organizer shaping chromatin architecture by directly binding to the chromatin adaptor protein OsMSI1 and enhancing its interaction with the histone deacetylase OsHDAC1, thereby decreasing chromatin accessibility and fine-tuning ABA signaling. VIVIpary is differentially expressed between wild and cultivated rice, with higher expression in japonica rice, indicating that it would be a target of selection during domestication. Together, our findings uncover a domestication-associated lncRNA that modulates ABA signaling and chromatin architecture to regulate seed dormancy and PHS in rice, providing target potential for rice agronomic trait improvement.",Epigenetics,seed dormancy allows seeds remain dormant environmental conditions ideal germination understanding molecular mechanisms underlying seed dormancy essential improving grain quality preventing preharvest sprouting phs major challenge globe agriculture address long noncoding rnas lncrnas contribute regulation seed dormancy rice oryza sativa identified lncrna vivipary specifically expressed embryos associated shortened seed dormancy vivipary exhibits elevated expression level phs sensitive variety overexpression induces phs whereas knockdown delays germination mechanically vivipary promotes release seed dormancy regulating abscisic acid aba signaling vivipary serves spatial organizer shaping chromatin architecture directly binding chromatin adaptor protein osmsi enhancing interaction histone deacetylase oshdac thereby decreasing chromatin accessibility finetuning aba signaling vivipary differentially expressed wild cultivated rice higher expression japonica rice indicating would target selection domestication together findings uncover domesticationassociated lncrna modulates aba signaling chromatin architecture regulate seed dormancy phs rice providing target potential rice agronomic trait improvement,Epigenetics
"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is widely recognized as an effective treatment for various malignant diseases. Enhancing HSC mobilization can improve transplantation outcomes and ultimately increase patient survival rates. Recent studies suggest that mild endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes HSC self-renewal, anti-apoptotic, and anti-aging capabilities. This led us to investigate whether inducing mild ER stress could facilitate HSC mobilization. The phenotype changes in cells treated with ER stress inducers and Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors were assessed using flow cytometry. The efficacy of these agents on HSC mobilization was evaluated in C57Bl/6 mice, with colony forming unit (CFU) assays used for quantification. Knockdown Jurkat cell lines were constructed to validate the role of SERCA in the mobilization mechanism. Molecular and protein expression levels associated with the pathway were analyzed through quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and western blotting. Our findings revealed that BHQ, a SERCA inhibitor, efficiently enhanced HSC mobilization in vivo. Mechanistically, BHQ regulated the CaMKII-STAT3-CXCR4 pathway by suppressing SERCA activity. This inhibition led to a reduction in CXCR4 expression on the surface of HSCs, facilitating their migration from the bone marrow into peripheral circulation. Our study provides novel insights into the role of the SERCA-ER stress pathway in HSC mobilization. By targeting SERCA activity with BHQ, we observed a significant enhancement in the mobilization of HSCs, facilitated by the modulation of the CaMKII-STAT3-CXCR4 signaling pathway. This research highlights the potential of utilizing mild ER stress as a strategy to promote HSC mobilization, with significant implications for improving stem cell-based therapies, including those used in HSC transplantation.",Epigenetics,hematopoietic stem cell hsc transplantation widely recognized effective treatment various malignant diseases enhancing hsc mobilization improve transplantation outcomes ultimately increase patient survival rates recent studies suggest mild endoplasmic reticulum er stress promotes hsc selfrenewal antiapoptotic antiaging capabilities led us investigate whether inducing mild er stress could facilitate hsc mobilization phenotype changes cells treated er stress inducers sarcoendoplasmic reticulum caatpase serca inhibitors assessed using flow cytometry efficacy agents hsc mobilization evaluated cbl mice colony forming unit cfu assays used quantification knockdown jurkat cell lines constructed validate role serca mobilization mechanism molecular protein expression levels associated pathway analyzed quantitative reversetranscription pcr western blotting findings revealed bhq serca inhibitor efficiently enhanced hsc mobilization vivo mechanistically bhq regulated camkiistatcxcr pathway suppressing serca activity inhibition led reduction cxcr expression surface hscs facilitating migration bone marrow peripheral circulation study provides novel insights role sercaer stress pathway hsc mobilization targeting serca activity bhq observed significant enhancement mobilization hscs facilitated modulation camkiistatcxcr signaling pathway research highlights potential utilizing mild er stress strategy promote hsc mobilization significant implications improving stem cellbased therapies including used hsc transplantation,Epigenetics
"Biological age reflects inter-individual differences in biological function and capacity beyond chronological age. DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA), which was calculated as residuals of leukocyte cell count adjusted linear regression of DNAmA on chronological age, were used to estimate biological age in this study. Low levels of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and the selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) are associated with adverse health outcomes and selenium supplementation is discussed as an anti-aging intervention. In this study, we cross-sectionally analyzed 1568 older participants from the observational Berlin Aging Study II (mean age ± SD: 68.8 ± 3.7 years, 51% women). Serum selenium was measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy and SELENOP was determined by sandwich ELISA. GPx3 was assessed as part of a proteomics dataset using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The relationship between selenium biomarkers and epigenetic clock measures was analyzed using linear regression analyses. P values and 95% confidence intervals (not adjusted for multiple testing) are stated for each analysis. Participants with deficient serum selenium levels (< 90 μg/L) had a higher rate of biological aging (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.033 to - 0.004, p = 0.010, n = 865). This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, and first four genetic principal components (β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.034 to - 0.004, p = 0.012, n = 757). Compared to the highest quartile, participants in the lowest quartile of SELENOP levels showed an accelerated biological aging rate (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.051 to - 0.008, p = 0.007, n = 740, fully adjusted model). Similarly, after adjustment for confounders, accelerated biological age was found in participants within the lowest GPx3 quartile compared to participants in the fourth quartile (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.04, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.06 to - 0.02, p = 0.001, n = 674 and GrimAge, β = - 0.98, SE = 0.32, 95% CI - 1.6 to - 0.4, p = 0.002, n = 608).

"The pace of life (POL) is shaped by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, influencing growth, maturation, and lifespan across species. The Hippo signaling pathway, a key regulator of organ size and cellular homeostasis, has emerged as a central integrator of environmental cues that modulate POL traits. In this review, we explore how the Hippo pathway links environmental factors-such as temperature fluctuations and dietary energy availability-to molecular mechanisms governing metabolic balance, hormonal signaling, and reproductive timing. Specifically, we highlight the regulatory interactions between the Hippo pathway and metabolic sensors (AMPK, mTOR, SIRT1 and DLK1-Notch), as well as hormonal signals (IGF-1, kisspeptin, leptin, cortisol, thyroid and sex steroids), which together orchestrate key life-history traits, including growth rates, lifespan and sexual maturation, with a particular emphasis on their role in reproductive timing. Furthermore, we consider its role as a potential coordinator of POL-related molecular processes, such as telomere dynamics and epigenetic mechanisms, within a broader regulatory network. By integrating insights from molecular biology and eco-evolutionary perspectives, we propose future directions to dissect the Hippo pathway's role in POL regulation across taxa. Understanding these interactions will provide new perspectives on how organisms adaptively adjust life-history strategies in response to environmental variability.",Epigenetics,pace life pol shaped complex interplay genetic environmental factors influencing growth maturation lifespan across species hippo signaling pathway key regulator organ size cellular homeostasis emerged central integrator environmental cues modulate pol traits review explore hippo pathway links environmental factorssuch temperature fluctuations dietary energy availabilityto molecular mechanisms governing metabolic balance hormonal signaling reproductive timing specifically highlight regulatory interactions hippo pathway metabolic sensors ampk mtor sirt dlknotch well hormonal signals igf kisspeptin leptin cortisol thyroid sex steroids together orchestrate key lifehistory traits including growth rates lifespan sexual maturation particular emphasis role reproductive timing furthermore consider role potential coordinator polrelated molecular processes telomere dynamics epigenetic mechanisms within broader regulatory network integrating insights molecular biology ecoevolutionary perspectives propose future directions dissect hippo pathways role pol regulation across taxa understanding interactions provide new perspectives organisms adaptively adjust lifehistory strategies response environmental variability,Epigenetics
"Hundreds of rare genetic variants associated with autism or intellectual disability have been identified, and many impact genes known to have a primary epigenetic/chromatin regulatory function. The objective of this study was to examine and compare behavioural profiles and longitudinal psychotropic treatment patterns in children with epigenetic/chromatin variants, other rare variants impacting neurodevelopment, or no known genetic condition. Using electronic medical records from a pediatric psychopharmacology program for children with autism or intellectual disability, we compared clinical characteristics, longitudinal psychotropic medication profiles and side effects between those with and without a rare genetic variant, and by variant subtype [epigenetic/chromatin regulation or other variant]. A total of 331 children attended 2724 unique medical visits between 2019 and 2022, with a mean of 8 follow-up visits over 3.4 years. Nine children (3%) had variants in epigenetic/chromatin regulatory genes (EC), twenty-three children (7%) had other rare genetic variants (OTH), and the rest had no reported variant (NR, n = 299, 90%). Those with a rare genetic variant (EC or OTH) were more likely to have an intellectual disability and had a greater number of co-occurring physical health conditions (p < 0.01). Overall, 66% of psychotropic medications were continued for ≥ 3 visits, while 26% were discontinued. Rates of psychotropic polypharmacy, medication patterns, behavioural challenges, and co-occurring developmental diagnoses were similar between genetic groups. Analyses uncorrected for multiple comparisons suggested those with genetic variants were more likely to experience drowsiness/sedation as a side effect (EC 33%, OTH 35%, NR 16%, p < 0.05); weight gain as a side effect was also higher in the epigenetic/chromatin group (EC 50% vs OTH 11%).

"Limb regeneration in the Mexican axolotl relies on the dedifferentiation of mature limb cells into blastema cells, which gain the ability to respond to patterning signals that guide tissue regeneration. While limb nerves are essential to make the blastema cells competent to pattern, the mechanisms remain unclear due to the complex and overlapping signals in amputated limbs. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Competency Accessory Limb Model (CALM), a simplified limb regeneration assay to study the induction and maintenance of patterning competency. Using CALM, here we show specific temporal windows during which cells acquire competency and associate this state with distinct H3K27me3 chromatin signatures. Furthermore, a combination of FGF and BMP signaling is sufficient to induce patterning competency in limb wound cells, and the ErBB signaling pathway is a downstream epigenetic target of these signals. These findings offer new insights into the molecular regulation of regenerative patterning.",Epigenetics,limb regeneration mexican axolotl relies dedifferentiation mature limb cells blastema cells gain ability respond patterning signals guide tissue regeneration limb nerves essential make blastema cells competent pattern mechanisms remain unclear due complex overlapping signals amputated limbs overcome challenge developed competency accessory limb model calm simplified limb regeneration assay study induction maintenance patterning competency using calm show specific temporal windows cells acquire competency associate state distinct hkme chromatin signatures furthermore combination fgf bmp signaling sufficient induce patterning competency limb wound cells erbb signaling pathway downstream epigenetic target signals findings offer new insights molecular regulation regenerative patterning,Epigenetics
"Despite being essential for fertility, genome-defense-pathway genes often evolve rapidly. However, little is known about the molecular basis of this adaptation. Here, we characterized the evolution of a protein interaction network within the PIWI-interacting small RNA (piRNA) genome-defense pathway in Drosophila at unprecedented scale and evolutionary resolution. We uncovered the pervasive rapid evolution of a protein interaction network anchored at the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) paralog Rhino. Through cross-species high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid screening, we identified three distinct evolutionary protein interaction trajectories across ~40 million years of Drosophila evolution. While several protein interactions are fully conserved, indicating functional conservation despite rapid amino acid-sequence change, other interactions are preserved through coevolution and were detected only between proteins within or from closely related species. We also identified species-restricted protein interactions, revealing insight into the mechanistic diversity and ongoing molecular innovation in Drosophila piRNA production. In sum, our analyses reveal principles of interaction evolution in an adaptively evolving protein-protein interaction network, and support intermolecular interaction innovation as a central molecular mechanism of evolutionary adaptation in protein-coding genes.",Epigenetics,despite essential fertility genomedefensepathway genes often evolve rapidly however little known molecular basis adaptation characterized evolution protein interaction network within piwiinteracting small rna pirna genomedefense pathway drosophila unprecedented scale evolutionary resolution uncovered pervasive rapid evolution protein interaction network anchored heterochromatin protein hp paralog rhino crossspecies highthroughput yeasttwohybrid screening identified three distinct evolutionary protein interaction trajectories across million years drosophila evolution several protein interactions fully conserved indicating functional conservation despite rapid amino acidsequence change interactions preserved coevolution detected proteins within closely related species also identified speciesrestricted protein interactions revealing insight mechanistic diversity ongoing molecular innovation drosophila pirna production sum analyses reveal principles interaction evolution adaptively evolving proteinprotein interaction network support intermolecular interaction innovation central molecular mechanism evolutionary adaptation proteincoding genes,Epigenetics
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) possesses high malignant and metastatic rates among all subtypes. Chemotherapy is a standard of care for TNBC but only a small moiety of patients achieved complete relief (CR) after chemotherapy. The recent concept of tumor ecosystem has provided new insights into solutions from an approach of enhancing anti-tumoral immunity of macrophages. We hereby observed a positive correlation of YTHDC2 abundance with anti-tumoral gene markers of macrophages. YTHDC2-high macrophages also exerted interactions with other immune cells such as T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells. Further investigation on the transcriptional regulatory network identified six transcriptional factors upregulated by YTHDC2, and they together influenced the expressions of TWISTNB and the oncogene MYC. Additionally, our survival analysis prompted that YTHDC2 is prognostic of higher chemo-therapeutic efficacy and better survival outcomes. We demonstrated that ample macrophage YTHDC2 indicates anti-tumoral phenotype polarization and propitious survival outcome in post-treatment TNBC patients (Clinical trial registry name: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Registration No.: ChiCTR2400084513, Registration Date: 2024-05-20).",Epigenetics,triplenegative breast cancer tnbc possesses high malignant metastatic rates among subtypes chemotherapy standard care tnbc small moiety patients achieved complete relief cr chemotherapy recent concept tumor ecosystem provided new insights solutions approach enhancing antitumoral immunity macrophages hereby observed positive correlation ythdc abundance antitumoral gene markers macrophages ythdchigh macrophages also exerted interactions immune cells helper cells cytotoxic cells nk cells investigation transcriptional regulatory network identified six transcriptional factors upregulated ythdc together influenced expressions twistnb oncogene myc additionally survival analysis prompted ythdc prognostic higher chemotherapeutic efficacy better survival outcomes demonstrated ample macrophage ythdc indicates antitumoral phenotype polarization propitious survival outcome posttreatment tnbc patients clinical trial registry name chinese clinical trial registry registration chictr registration date,Epigenetics

"The ability of cancer cells to evade immune destruction is governed by various intrinsic factors including their metabolic state. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a pyrimidine synthesis enzyme, increases cancer cell sensitivity to T cell cytotoxicity through induction of ferroptosis. Lipidomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that DHODH inhibition reduces CDP-choline level and attenuates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) via the CDP-choline-dependent Kennedy pathway. To compensate this loss, there is increased synthesis from phosphatidylethanolamine via the phospholipid methylation pathway resulting in increased generation of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PCs. Importantly, inactivation of Dhodh in cancer cells promotes the infiltration of interferon γ-secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhances the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 blockade in female mouse models. Our findings reveal the importance of DHODH in regulating immune evasion through a CDP-choline dependent mechanism and implicate DHODH as a promising target to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.",Epigenetics,ability cancer cells evade immune destruction governed various intrinsic factors including metabolic state demonstrate inactivation dihydroorotate dehydrogenase dhodh pyrimidine synthesis enzyme increases cancer cell sensitivity cell cytotoxicity induction ferroptosis lipidomic metabolomic analyses reveal dhodh inhibition reduces cdpcholine level attenuates synthesis phosphatidylcholine pc via cdpcholinedependent kennedy pathway compensate loss increased synthesis phosphatidylethanolamine via phospholipid methylation pathway resulting increased generation long chain polyunsaturated fatty acidcontaining pcs importantly inactivation dhodh cancer cells promotes infiltration interferon secreting cdsupsup cells enhances antitumor activity pd blockade female mouse models findings reveal importance dhodh regulating immune evasion cdpcholine dependent mechanism implicate dhodh promising target improve efficacy cancer immunotherapies,Epigenetics

"Epigenetic changes in gene expression due to DNA methylation regulate pulmonary vascular structure and function. Genetic or acquired alterations in DNA methylation/demethylation can promote the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Here, we performed epigenome-wide mapping of DNA methylation in whole blood from 10 healthy people and 19 age/sex-matched PAH patients from the PAH Biobank. Exome sequencing confirmed the absence of known mutations in PAH-associated gene variants identifying subjects with or without mutations of TET2, a putative PAH gene encoding the demethylating enzyme, TET2. DNA of patients with PAH and no TET2 mutation was hypermethylated compared to healthy controls. Patients with PAH and a TET2 mutation had greater DNA CpG methylation than mutation-free PAH patients. Unique Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) were more common in patients with PAH with TET2 mutations (1164) than in PAH without mutations (262). We correlated methylome findings with a public PAH transcriptomic RNA dataset, prioritizing targets that are both hypermethylated in our cohort and downregulated at the RNA level. Relative to controls, functional analysis reveals enriched functions related to T cell differentiation in PAH patients with a TET2 mutation. We identified genes with downregulated expression that were hypermethylated in PAH patients (with or without a TET2 mutation). In both cases, a conserved T cell phenotype emerged. Pan-chromosomal hypermethylation in PAH is greatest in patients with TET2 mutations. Observed hypermethylation of genes involved in the pathogenesis of PAH, such as EIF2AK4, and transcription factors that regulate T cell development, such as TCF7, merit further study and may contribute to the inflammation in PAH.",Epigenetics,epigenetic changes gene expression due dna methylation regulate pulmonary vascular structure function genetic acquired alterations dna methylationdemethylation promote development pulmonary arterial hypertension pah performed epigenomewide mapping dna methylation whole blood healthy people agesexmatched pah patients pah biobank exome sequencing confirmed absence known mutations pahassociated gene variants identifying subjects without mutations tet putative pah gene encoding demethylating enzyme tet dna patients pah tet mutation hypermethylated compared healthy controls patients pah tet mutation greater dna cpg methylation mutationfree pah patients unique differentially methylated regions dmr common patients pah tet mutations pah without mutations correlated methylome findings public pah transcriptomic rna dataset prioritizing targets hypermethylated cohort downregulated rna level relative controls functional analysis reveals enriched functions related cell differentiation pah patients tet mutation identified genes downregulated expression hypermethylated pah patients without tet mutation cases conserved cell phenotype emerged panchromosomal hypermethylation pah greatest patients tet mutations observed hypermethylation genes involved pathogenesis pah eifak transcription factors regulate cell development tcf merit study may contribute inflammation pah,Epigenetics
"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) display aggressive phenotypes contributing to synovitis and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis has been proposed to aggravate the RA pathogenesis, however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to elucidate the role of mitophagy receptor FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1) on RA-FLS migration and invasion. We analyzed the correlation of synovial FUNDC1 expression with joint destruction and disease activity in RA patients. Single cell sequencing data analysis combined with immunofluorescence indicated the specific expression and localization of FUNDC1 in synovial tissue and RA-FLS. The roles of FUNDC1 in the migration, invasion, and cytokine secretion of RA-FLS were examined by patient-derived primary culture as well as SCID mouse models. We investigated the effects and mechanism of FUNDC1 on mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control network in primary RA-FLS. We found that the FUNDC1 was mainly expressed in FLS and exhibited a decreased level in RA synovium, which was correlated with severe joint destruction. Deficiency of FUNDC1 enhanced migration, invasion as well as secretion of matrix metalloproteinases in RA-FLS. On the contrary, overexpression of FUNDC1 in RA-FLS with low FUNDC1 inhibited the migration, invasion and secretion capacity of RA-FLS. Mechanistically, repressed FUNDC1 level in RA-FLS impaired mitophagy, imbalanced mitochondrial quality control, and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, leading to the overactivation of the MAPK pathway. Treatment with mtROS scavenger mtTEMPO can reverse this process and diminish the invasiveness of RA-FLS. Deficiency of FUNDC1 dysregulates mitochondrial quality-control system and induces aggressive phenotype of RA-FLS, resulting in joint destruction during RA progression.",Epigenetics,fibroblastlike synoviocytes fls display aggressive phenotypes contributing synovitis joint destruction rheumatoid arthritis ra disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis proposed aggravate ra pathogenesis however underlying mechanism remains elucidated study aimed elucidate role mitophagy receptor fun domaincontaining fundc rafls migration invasion analyzed correlation synovial fundc expression joint destruction disease activity ra patients single cell sequencing data analysis combined immunofluorescence indicated specific expression localization fundc synovial tissue rafls roles fundc migration invasion cytokine secretion rafls examined patientderived primary culture well scid mouse models investigated effects mechanism fundc mitophagy mitochondrial quality control network primary rafls found fundc mainly expressed fls exhibited decreased level ra synovium correlated severe joint destruction deficiency fundc enhanced migration invasion well secretion matrix metalloproteinases rafls contrary overexpression fundc rafls low fundc inhibited migration invasion secretion capacity rafls mechanistically repressed fundc level rafls impaired mitophagy imbalanced mitochondrial quality control increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mtros production leading overactivation mapk pathway treatment mtros scavenger mttempo reverse process diminish invasiveness rafls deficiency fundc dysregulates mitochondrial qualitycontrol system induces aggressive phenotype rafls resulting joint destruction ra progression,Epigenetics
"Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is closely associated with trophoblast dysfunction, yet the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, we found a significantly decreased level of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in RSA villous tissues compared to normal pregnancies. NNMT knockdown suppressed trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and increased embryo absorption rate in vivo. Upstream of NNMT, FOXA1 was identified as its transcriptional regulator, which was also downregulated in RSA villous tissues. Mechanistically, reduced NNMT led to the accumulation of methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine, thus promoting the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. This epigenetic modification further inhibited the expression of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), along with its binding to CD36 receptor and subsequent activation of ERK1/2 pathway in trophoblast. Together, our study demonstrates the crucial role of NNMT at the maternal-fetal interface, provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of RSA, and lays a basis for developing targeted therapies.",Epigenetics,recurrent spontaneous abortion rsa closely associated trophoblast dysfunction yet underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood herein found significantly decreased level nicotinamide nmethyltransferase nnmt rsa villous tissues compared normal pregnancies nnmt knockdown suppressed trophoblast proliferation migration invasion vitro increased embryo absorption rate vivo upstream nnmt foxa identified transcriptional regulator also downregulated rsa villous tissues mechanistically reduced nnmt led accumulation methyl donor sadenosyl methionine thus promoting methylation histone h lysine epigenetic modification inhibited expression cartilage oligomeric matrix protein comp along binding cd receptor subsequent activation erk pathway trophoblast together study demonstrates crucial role nnmt maternalfetal interface provides mechanistic insights pathogenesis rsa lays basis developing targeted therapies,Epigenetics
"To achieve system-level insights into proteome organization, regulation, and function, we developed an approach to generate complex cell pools with endogenously tagged proteins amenable to high-throughput visualization and perturbation. Pooled imaging coupled to in situ barcode sequencing identified the subcellular localization of each HaloTag-tagged protein, and subsequent ligand-induced misfolding of the library followed by single-cell RNA sequencing revealed responses to spatially restricted protein misfolding. These datasets characterized protein quality control responses in previously uninterrogated cellular compartments, and cross-compartment analyses revealed mutually exclusive rather than collaborative responses, whereby the heat shock response (HSR) is induced in some compartments and repressed in others where autophagy genes are induced. We further assign protein quality control functions to previously uncharacterized genes based on shared transcriptional responses to protein misfolding across cellular compartments.

"In humans, selective and promiscuous interactions between 46 secreted chemokine ligands and 23 cell surface chemokine receptors of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family form a complex network to coordinate cell migration. While chemokines and their GPCRs each share common structural scaffolds, the molecular principles driving selectivity and promiscuity remain elusive. Here, we identify conserved, semi-conserved, and variable determinants (i.e., recognition elements) that are encoded and decoded by chemokines and their receptors to mediate interactions. Selectivity and promiscuity emerge from an ensemble of generalized (""public/conserved"") and specific (""private/variable"") determinants distributed among structured and unstructured protein regions, with ligands and receptors recognizing these determinants combinatorially.

"The folding of the genome in the 3D nuclear space is fundamental for regulating all DNA-related processes. The association of the genome with the nuclear lamina into lamina-associated domains (LADs) represents the earliest feature of nuclear organization during development. Here, we performed a gain-of-function screen in mouse embryos to obtain mechanistic insights. We find that perturbations impacting histone H3 modifications, heterochromatin, and histone content are crucial for the establishment of nuclear architecture in zygotes and/or 2-cell-stage embryos. Notably, some perturbations exerted differential effects on zygotes versus 2-cell-stage embryos. Moreover, embryos with disrupted LADs can rebuild nuclear architecture at the 2-cell stage, indicating that the initial establishment of LADs in zygotes might be dispensable for early development.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are one of the most promising areas in oncoimmunology research. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) expression has been linked to the advanced stages with reduced survival in several types of cancer, primarily due to its association with the dysfunction in T cells. Thus, TIM-3 is an interesting target in designing advanced therapy for cancer. TIM-3 has been implicated in resistance to immunotherapy on account of its involvement in T cell exhaustion. Identifying small molecule inhibitors targeting TIM-3 with high affinity, either alone or in combination with either chemotherapy or other types of immunotherapies could significantly enhance the life span, overcoming the resistance and overall immune response in therapy. TIM-3 pathway is multidimensional in terms of canonical signaling with varied expression of immune cells and diverse ligands and modulates the immune response. This may include restoration of the functioning of killer T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (NK cells) and likely promise better results in cancer immunotherapy.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Advanced CRC has a poor prognosis, with treatment primarily relying on chemotherapy combined with targeted therapies. Currently, immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors is reserved exclusively for mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, which represent less than 10% of advanced CRC cases. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a type of adoptive cell therapy involving modified T-lymphocytes engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors, enabling them to recognize surface antigens expressed by tumor cells. CAR-T cell therapy has demonstrated efficacy in treating hematological malignancies such as lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia. However, its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited due to several limitations such as antigen heterogeneity, restricted CAR-T cell trafficking into the tumor area, and the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Developing novel CAR-T cell therapies for solid tumors represents an unmet need, particularly for cases where immune checkpoint blockade is ineffective, such as CRC. Preclinical studies have shown the efficacy of various CAR-T cell models targeting a wide range of tumor-associated antigens in CRC, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Despite these promising results, the clinical efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy for CRC has been limited in early-phase clinical trials. Factors such as trial design or tumor characteristics, including antigen heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive microenvironment, should be considered.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study assessed the effects of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in 548 diabetic patients from Tianjin, China, categorized by vaccination status: unvaccinated (n=94), primary immunization (n=117), and booster immunization (n=337). A total of 22 clinical values were assessed prior to vaccination, 3 months after vaccination, and 12 months after vaccination. Variables with a normal distribution were compared across groups using one-way ANOVA, while non-normally distributed variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square tests for categorical data. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of time and vaccine type on these clinical values, with random intercepts to account for within-subject variability and interaction terms for detailed group comparisons over time. RESULTS Baseline results showed no major differences across groups, including fasting glucose, HbA1c, granulocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, renal function markers such as uric acid, creatinine, and eGFR. Booster vaccination significantly reduced FPG (Estimate=-0.123, p<0.001) and HbA1c (Estimate=-0.049, p<0.01), with primary vaccination also reducing FPG (Estimate=-0.118, p<0.001) and HbA1c (Estimate=-0.040, p<0.05).

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and lethal cancer, often diagnosed at advanced stages where traditional treatments such as surgical resection, liver transplantation, and locoregional therapies provide limited benefits. Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has emerged as a promising treatment modality for advanced HCC, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy through targeted drug delivery while minimizing systemic side effects. However, the heterogeneous nature of HCC leads to variable responses to HAIC, highlighting the necessity for reliable predictive indicators to tailor personalized treatment strategies. This review explores the factors influencing HAIC success, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics, biomarkers, genomic profiles, and advanced imaging techniques such as radiomics and deep learning models. Additionally, the synergistic potential of HAIC combined with immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies is examined, demonstrating improved survival outcomes. Prognostic scoring systems and nomograms that integrate clinical, molecular, and imaging data are discussed as superior tools for individualized prognostication compared to traditional staging systems.

PKM2 was found to be significantly upregulated in most malignancies and associated with a bad prognosis. In some cancers, the PKM2 DNA promoter was hypomethylated. The expression of PKM2 was positively linked with most m6A-methylation-related genes in pan-cancer. The functions of PKM2 were primarily associated with the regulation of the immune system, glycolysis, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PKM2 was favorably associated with neutrophils and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment of most cancers. Importantly, PKM2 showed a strikingly high correlation with CD274 (PD-L1), CD276, TGF-β1, VEGFA, and HAVCR2 in most cancers. Finally, using experiments, it was confirmed that silencing PKM2 could increase the sensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to cisplatin by regulating autophagy.

"Airborne respiratory tract infection typically occurs seasonally in subtropical countries, particularly during winter, when transmission and fatality rates considerably rise, indicating that low humidity and freezing temperatures facilitate the transmission of viral strains in age heterogeneity. Despite this, the atmospheric elements that contribute to periodic influenza occurrences and their critical influence on the spread of influenza stay ambiguous in various age groups. The oversight of undetected cases amid a widespread outbreak of transmissible illnesses results in an underappreciation of the prevalence of infection and the basic recurrence rate. This study proposes the dynamics of the influenza epidemic in the province of Madrid, Spain, with an emphasis on the effects of control employing actual data. The main challenge is accurately estimating the virus's rate of transmission and assessing the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. By taking into account the modified Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo (mABC) fractional difference operator, we develop an analytical framework for an outbreak caused by influenza and broaden it to accommodate the fractional scenario. The non-negativity and boundedness are guaranteed by the computation of the fractional-order influenza system. At the disease-free equilibrium (DFE), we perform a local asymptotic stability analysis (LAS) and display the outcome for [Formula: see text]. In addition, periodic solutions and the model's uniform permanence are proved. Environmental factors to decrease interaction between different ages, increase immunization protection, and minimize vaccine refusal risks are the most efficient way to meet preventative and surveillance targets. Our system's best-fit parameter settings were detected using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (M-C-M-C) technique with influenza information collected in Spain. We predict a basic reproduction number of 1.3645 (96% C.I: (1.3644, 1.3646)). The framework's essential variables are determined using unpredictability and sensitivity evaluation. To further bolster the operator's effectiveness, a number of tests of this novel kind of operator were conducted. We remark that in various time scale domains [Formula: see text], the investigated discrete formulations will be [Formula: see text]-nonincreasing or [Formula: see text]-nondecreasing by examining [Formula: see text]-monotonicity formulations and the basic properties of the suggested operator. Algorithms are constructed in the discrete generalized Mittag-Leffler (GML) kernel for mathematical simulations, emphasizing the effects of the infection resulting from multiple factors. The dynamical technique used to build the influenza framework was significantly impacted by fractional-order. In order to lessen the infections, time-dependent control factors are also implemented. The optimality criteria are produced by applying Pontryagin's maximal argument to prove the validity of the most effective control. If vaccine penetration and immunity rates have been resurrected, achieving the control objective requires 12 months longer and costs less than the previous scenario.",Immunotherapy,airborne respiratory tract infection typically occurs seasonally subtropical countries particularly winter transmission fatality rates considerably rise indicating low humidity freezing temperatures facilitate transmission viral strains age heterogeneity despite atmospheric elements contribute periodic influenza occurrences critical influence spread influenza stay ambiguous various age groups oversight undetected cases amid widespread outbreak transmissible illnesses results underappreciation prevalence infection basic recurrence rate study proposes dynamics influenza epidemic province madrid spain emphasis effects control employing actual data main challenge accurately estimating viruss rate transmission assessing effectiveness vaccination campaigns taking account modified atanganabaleanucaputo mabc fractional difference operator develop analytical framework outbreak caused influenza broaden accommodate fractional scenario nonnegativity boundedness guaranteed computation fractionalorder influenza system diseasefree equilibrium dfe perform local asymptotic stability analysis las display outcome formula see text addition periodic solutions models uniform permanence proved environmental factors decrease interaction different ages increase immunization protection minimize vaccine refusal risks efficient way meet preventative surveillance targets systems bestfit parameter settings detected using markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique influenza information collected spain predict basic reproduction number ci frameworks essential variables determined using unpredictability sensitivity evaluation bolster operators effectiveness number tests novel kind operator conducted remark various time scale domains formula see text investigated discrete formulations formula see textnonincreasing formula see textnondecreasing examining formula see textmonotonicity formulations basic properties suggested operator algorithms constructed discrete generalized mittagleffler gml kernel mathematical simulations emphasizing effects infection resulting multiple factors dynamical technique used build influenza framework significantly impacted fractionalorder order lessen infections timedependent control factors also implemented optimality criteria produced applying pontryagins maximal argument prove validity effective control vaccine penetration immunity rates resurrected achieving control objective requires months longer costs less previous scenario,Immunotherapy
"Patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) grade (G) 1-3A who meet treatment criteria are commonly treated with chemo-immunotherapy regimens such as bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) or rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (RCHOP). Two prospective trials have compared BR to RCHOP-like regimens and showed improved progression free survival with BR in FL G1-2 patients. However, in real-world practice, there is clinical variability in utilization of BR versus RCHOP-like regimens. Additionally, the optimal treatment for patients with FL G3A remains unclear. We used a nationwide electronic health record-derived de-identified database to compare outcomes in 2089 patients with FL G1-3A treated with frontline BR versus RCHOP-like regimens. We demonstrated clinical improvement in time to next treatment or death (TTNTD) with BR (median 96 vs. 78 months, HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.986-1.332, P = .086), albeit not statistically significant. No difference in overall survival (OS) was observed. Maintenance rituximab was associated with improved TTNTD and OS. Among G3A patients (N = 304), TTNTD was comparable between the 2 regimens, however OS was significantly improved with RCHOP-like regimens in univariate analysis (median 138 vs. 96 months, HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.313-0.834, P = .007). In conclusion, this study of real-world patients supports the use of BR and rituximab maintenance for front-line treatment of FL.

"Circulating tumor cells (CTC), released by primary tumors into the bloodstream, represent a valuable source to inform on cancer heterogeneity, cancer progression, metastatic disease and therapy efficacy without the need of invasive tumor biopsies. However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype. Despite technical and conceptual issues, tracking circulating CSCs has the potential to improve the prognostic/predictive value of CTCs in NSCLC setting and could provide novel insights into the comprehension of the metastatic process and identification of novel therapeutic targets.",Immunotherapy,circulating tumor cells ctc released primary tumors bloodstream represent valuable source inform cancer heterogeneity cancer progression metastatic disease therapy efficacy without need invasive tumor biopsies however extreme rarity heterogeneity ctcs occurring genotypic phenotypic functional levels poses major challenge study population explains lack standardized strategies ctc isolation lung cancer leading causes cancerrelated death worldwide paradigmatic example ctc heterogeneity undermine clinical utility biomarker since contrasting data reported using different isolation technologies evidences suggest fraction ctc characterized stemlike feature partial epithelialmesenchymal transition emt phenotype sustain metastasis initiation cancer stem cells cscs potential maintain primary tumors initiate metastasis escape chemotherapy immunotherapy treatments moreover close connection reported several tumor types among hybrid phenotype characterized retention epithelial mesenchymal traits acquisition csc feature increased metastatic potential review focuses phenotypic functional heterogeneity ctcs resulting implications isolation clinical validation especially setting nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc particular discuss relevant studies providing evidence presence prognosticpredictive value ctc subsets characterized stemlike hybrid emt phenotype despite technical conceptual issues tracking circulating cscs potential improve prognosticpredictive value ctcs nsclc setting could provide novel insights comprehension metastatic process identification novel therapeutic targets,Immunotherapy
"Cabozantinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting AXL and MET, is approved for second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the combination of cabozantinib with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) remains controversial after the COSMIC-312 study. The role of AXL and MET expression in predicting cabozantinib response is unclear. This study aims to evaluate cabozantinib's efficacy with ICIs and the predictive value of AXL and MET expression. From January 2019 and December 2023, 50 advanced HCC patients treated with cabozantinib were retrospectively enrolled. Overall, 74% of patients received prior immunotherapy, 72% had been treated with more than two different multiple kinase inhibitors (MKIs), and 58% received cabozantinib as a fifth-line or later therapy. Cabozantinib was used alone (60%), with ICIs (12%), or with chemotherapy (28%). A majority (70%) received a dosage exceeding 40 mg/day. The ORR to cabozantinib was 0%, while the DCR was 42.2%. median PFS was 3.3 months, and OS was 6.1 months. There was no significant difference in PFS or OS between patients receiving five or more lines of treatment and those receiving fewer. Cabozantinib plus ICIs showed longer PFS (6.7 vs. 3.2 months, p = 0.04) and a trend toward improved OS compared to cabozantinib alone. AXL expression may predict better outcomes. Common adverse effects included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (24.2%) and hypertension.

"The skin is the most immunogenic tissue in transplantation and the hardest tissue to induce immune modulation. Batf3-dependent type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are important in initiating rejection in murine skin transplantation. In humans, the CD141<sup>+</sup> cDC1 subset is the functional counterpart of the murine Batf3-dependent cDC1s. However, their contribution to the rejection of human skin allografts remains unknown. Using samples from human face and upper extremity transplant recipients, we demonstrated that CD141<sup>+</sup> cDC1s are increased and more activated in human skin grafts than native skin tissue from the same individual. Moreover, circulating and tissue CD141<sup>+</sup> cDC1s were elevated in rejection time points. Local modulation of graft CD141<sup>+</sup> cDC1s decreased HLA-DR expression and increased regulatory T cells, which correlated with a decreased presence of skin allogeneic T cells in a humanized transplantation model.

"Low-grade glioma (LGG) is a primary brain tumor with high cellular heterogeneity and recurrence, leading to poor prognosis. Standard treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) have limited efficacy. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, is a potential therapeutic target, while dysregulated ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) may drive tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study integrated multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify FRGs associated with LGG prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pseudotime trajectory analysis were performed to investigate their functional roles. Key findings were validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We identified 345 FRGs associated with LGG prognosis, which are involved in oxidative stress response, cell proliferation, and immune regulation. High-risk patients exhibited an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with elevated levels of M2 macrophages and Treg cells but reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted the dynamic roles of macrophages and astrocytes in immune evasion and microenvironment remodeling. Notably, the NUAK2 gene emerged as a key driver of tumor progression and immune suppression. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that targeting NUAK2 significantly reduced tumor cell viability and growth, underscoring its critical regulatory role in LGG. Our study provides comprehensive insights into the role of FRGs in LGG prognosis and tumor microenvironment regulation, with a particular focus on the NUAK2 gene. As a potential therapeutic target, NUAK2's critical role in tumor progression and immune evasion offers a new direction for LGG treatment.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the most lethal tumors globally, characterized by high propensity for recurrence and metastasis. Consequently, the imperative challenge is to pioneer novel pharmaceuticals and therapeutic methodologies for efficacious HCC treatment. In the present study, we successfully synthesized a mannose, polyethylene glycol, and polyethyleneimine modified graphene oxide based LDN193189-delivery system (PGPML) for remodeling the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME) though targeting cancer stem cells. These PGPML nanoparticles possess the capability to target cancer stem cell and M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through specific binding to different mannose receptors. Within the acidic tumor microenvironment, the PGPML nanoparticles could inhibit proliferation, migration and reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which efficiently displayed the anti-tumor efficacy with HCC tumors in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the PGPML nanoparticles significantly downregulated the expression of cancer stem cell marker CD133, attenuates PD-L1 expression within TME, thereby reducing tumor stemness characteristics, promoting T cell activation and macrophage M2-M1 repolarization to remodel TME, augments the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in tumor cells, fostering tumor cell demise.

"Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is a terminal stage of gastrointestinal cancers, often resulting in poor survival outcomes. Traditional treatments like cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have shown some effectiveness but are associated with significant risks. This study presents a novel nanomotor-based drug delivery system (M@MnO<sub>2</sub>-Au-mSiO<sub>2</sub>@CDDP) designed to enhance the efficacy of PM treatment. By utilizing an oxygen-driven heterojunction nanomotor (MnO<sub>2</sub>-Au-mSiO<sub>2</sub>), coated with membrane of M1-type macrophages, the system targets PM tumors with high precision through intraperitoneal perfusion. These biomimetic NMs promote deep tumor penetration, enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and activate the STING pathway, a critical component in immune regulation. The catalytic properties of MnO<sub>2</sub> within the nanomotors enhance drug permeability and retention, enabling targeted and controlled drug release. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the system's ability to significantly inhibit tumor growth, induce apoptosis, and activate immune responses. In addition, the synergistic effect of targeted drug delivery, catalytic therapy and immunotherapy of this system was further confirmed by constructing an in vitro gastric cancer organoid model, showing great clinical application potential. The study also confirmed excellent biocompatibility and stability, making these NMs a promising clinical tool for the treatment of PM.

"Tislelizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) is approved for the treatment of multiple cancers. We used a model-based approach to propose three alternative dosing regimens, 150 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, and 400 mg Q6W, with the aims of providing flexible treatment regimens compatible with background chemotherapy and/or reducing infusion visits. A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate pharmacokinetic exposure of the alternative regimens. Regulatory guidance on alternative dosing was used to define pharmacokinetics-based criteria. Alternative doses were selected by simulation, exposure matching, and comparison to the reference regimen of 200 mg Q3W. Deviations from pharmacokinetics-based criteria were bridged using appropriate safety and efficacy references and exposure-response analyses. All three alternative dosing regimens produced comparable exposures versus 200 mg Q3W. Although simulated peak serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) at 300 mg Q4W and 400 mg Q6W was higher versus 200 mg Q3W, this was below the C<sub>max</sub> of the 5 mg/kg Q3W safety reference.

"Despite advancements in systemic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to exhibit poor prognosis, underscoring an urgent need for safer and more effective therapeutic strategies. This study investigates the safety profile and biological effects of bronchial arterial infusion (BAI)-administered anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (aPD-1 mAb) using a preclinical beagle model and a clinical cohort of advanced NSCLC patients. In preclinical evaluations, male beagles (n = 3/group) were randomized to receive 5 mg/kg aPD-1 mAb via BAI or intravenous routes (Venous group). Safety assessments included longitudinal imaging, biochemical analyses, and histopathological evaluation. Clinically, patients with advanced NSCLC meeting stringent inclusion criteria underwent BAI immunotherapy, with systematic monitoring of adverse events (AEs). Both administration routes demonstrated comparable safety in canines, with no evidence of immune-related pneumonitis or structural lung alterations on CT or histology. Transient AEs (e.g., hematoma, lameness) resolved spontaneously. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed similar systemic drug concentrations and tissue distribution between BAI and Venous groups (all p > 0.05). Biochemical profiling identified isolated mild LDH elevation in one BAI-treated canine. Notably, the BAI group exhibited significantly enhanced systemic IL-2 levels (80.15 ± 5.24 pg/mL vs. 66.47 ± 5.24 pg/mL in Venous groups, p = 0.001) at day 28, paralleled by elevated pulmonary IL-2 expression (626.90 ± 18.49 vs. 559.18 ± 45.61 pg/mg, p = 0.03). In the clinical cohort (n = 17; 94.1% male, mean age 61.6 ± 7.1 years), BAI immunotherapy was well-tolerated with mild AEs including nausea (n = 1), dyspnea (n = 1), atrial fibrillation (n = 1), and puncture-site hematoma (n = 1). No severe immune-related toxicities (e.g., pneumonitis) emerged during follow-up.

"Recently, Breiman et al. (2021) reported that the level of anti-Tn in the blood of healthy donors and COVID-19 patients is significantly lower in individuals of blood group A than B. This prompted us to look for qualitative differences in the repertoire of anti-Tn like specificity in individuals of different blood groups (BG). To this end, we isolated antibodies from the pooled sera of BG A and BG B healthy donors using GalNAcα-sepharose, followed by Printed Glycan Array analysis. As expected, antibodies affinity isolated from BG A donors completely lack species directed to canonical (GalNAcα-transferase dependent) A-glycans, such as A (types 1, 2 and 4), GalNAcα1-3(Fucα1-2)Gal, GalNAcα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (linear A), and ALe<sup>Y</sup>. Unexpectedly, GalNAcα1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAc, glycan with an unnatural 1-4 bond fell into the same group, i.e., antibodies to it were found only in BG B donors. Other unexpected results include the following: (1) for GalNAcα1-OCH<sub>2</sub>CH(COOH)NH<sub>2</sub> (GalNAcα-OSer, immobilized by NH<sub>2</sub> group) the opposite result was observed, i.e. affinity isolated anti-Tn antibodies of BG A donors demonstrated significantly higher titer than of BG B; (2) in BG A donors, the level of antibodies to GalNGcα1-3GalNAcα (i.e. disaccharide in N-glycolyl form) is close to background, while there is a significant level of these antibodies in the BG B donors. Since antiglycan antibodies are known to play both a protective role in antimicrobial immunity and to promote infectivity, the knowledge gained about the difference in the specificity profiles of anti-Tn antibodies signals the need to take blood group into account in developing therapeutic strategies.",Immunotherapy,recently breiman et al reported level antitn blood healthy donors covid patients significantly lower individuals blood group b prompted us look qualitative differences repertoire antitn like specificity individuals different blood groups bg end isolated antibodies pooled sera bg bg b healthy donors using galnacsepharose followed printed glycan array analysis expected antibodies affinity isolated bg donors completely lack species directed canonical galnactransferase dependent aglycans types galnacfucgal galnacgalglcnac linear alesupysup unexpectedly galnacgalglcnac glycan unnatural bond fell group ie antibodies found bg b donors unexpected results include following galnacochsubsubchcoohnhsubsub galnacoser immobilized nhsubsub group opposite result observed ie affinity isolated antitn antibodies bg donors demonstrated significantly higher titer bg b bg donors level antibodies galngcgalnac ie disaccharide nglycolyl form close background significant level antibodies bg b donors since antiglycan antibodies known play protective role antimicrobial immunity promote infectivity knowledge gained difference specificity profiles antitn antibodies signals need take blood group account developing therapeutic strategies,Immunotherapy
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus chemotherapy have become a new first-line treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. However, it is still controversial whether to choose chemotherapy alone or ICIs plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment option due to a lack of ideal predictive biomarkers for the efficacy. This study intended to explore the predictive value of inflammatory markers for the efficacy of first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy in this disease. This retrospective study included 131 patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who received first-line treatment between July, 2020 and June, 2023. Among them, 76 received first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy and 55 received chemotherapy alone. Firstly, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to explore the correlation between inflammatory markers and efficacy of first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy. Subsequently, the predictive value of combined baseline and dynamic changes in inflammatory markers was explored. Moreover, the predictive value of baseline inflammatory markers was further verified by comparing efficacy of ICIs plus chemotherapy with that of chemotherapy alone. In patients receiving first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy, low baseline monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) in peripheral blood was significantly associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and was an independent prognostic factor for OS. In addition, dynamic early changes of MLR also played predictive role. Patients whose MLR was lower at baseline and after two cycles of treatment had better OS (P = 0.009). Furthermore, compared to chemotherapy alone, patients with a lower baseline MLR were more likely to benefit from first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy. MLR could serve as a new biomarker to predict the efficacy of first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. And it is helpful to select the candidates for first-line ICIs plus chemotherapy, which is worthy of further study.",Immunotherapy,immune checkpoint inhibitors icis plus chemotherapy become new firstline treatment option patients locally advanced metastatic gastric cancer however still controversial whether choose chemotherapy alone icis plus chemotherapy firstline treatment option due lack ideal predictive biomarkers efficacy study intended explore predictive value inflammatory markers efficacy firstline icis plus chemotherapy disease retrospective study included patients locally advanced metastatic gastric cancer received firstline treatment july june among received firstline icis plus chemotherapy received chemotherapy alone firstly kaplanmeier cox regression analyses used explore correlation inflammatory markers efficacy firstline icis plus chemotherapy subsequently predictive value combined baseline dynamic changes inflammatory markers explored moreover predictive value baseline inflammatory markers verified comparing efficacy icis plus chemotherapy chemotherapy alone patients receiving firstline icis plus chemotherapy low baseline monocytetolymphocyte ratio mlr peripheral blood significantly associated better progressionfree survival pfs overall survival os independent prognostic factor os addition dynamic early changes mlr also played predictive role patients whose mlr lower baseline two cycles treatment better os p furthermore compared chemotherapy alone patients lower baseline mlr likely benefit firstline icis plus chemotherapy mlr could serve new biomarker predict efficacy firstline icis plus chemotherapy patients locally advanced metastatic gastric cancer helpful select candidates firstline icis plus chemotherapy worthy study,Immunotherapy
"The variability in the efficacy of allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) for nasal symptom control can be attributed to individual differences, to explore the hypothesis of systematic variability in AR symptom alleviation with AIT and to determine whether this variability correlates with AR severity, route of administration, treatment duration, age, or study publication year. We reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AIT for dust mite (DM)-induced AR, extracting data on baseline mean, endpoint mean, standard deviation (SD), and participant numbers. A random-slope mixed-effects model (RSMM) was employed to evaluate the differences in variability between the AIT and control groups, as well as to identify potential influencing factors. There was no significant difference in response variability between the AIT and control groups. The response variability to AIT was not associated with AR severity, route of administration, age, or year of publication. The cohort that underwent 36 months of AIT exhibited a higher degree of response variability compared to the group treated for 6 months. The present study did not identify systematic variability in individual response to AIT when measured by TNSS alone.

"This study investigates the therapeutic potential of bone marrow macrophages-derived dendritic cells (BMΦDCs) in enhancing antitumor immunity against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), focusing on their effects in inhibiting tumor growth, reducing metastasis, and modulating the tumor microenvironment. BMΦDCs were generated by culturing bone marrow cells with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) followed by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). MTCQ-1 tumor lysates were used for antigen loading. The phenotypic characteristics of BMΦDCs were analyzed using flow cytometry. In vivo antitumor efficacy was assessed in subcutaneous and lung metastasis models in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. Tumor growth was monitored, and tumor tissues were collected for histological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome, and anti-CD8 staining. BMΦDCs displayed higher maturation marker expression (CD40, CD86) compared to traditional BMDCs. In the subcutaneous tumor model, BMΦDCs significantly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. In the lung metastasis model, BMΦDCs effectively reduced metastatic burden. Histological analysis revealed increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and reduced tumor fibrosis in BMΦDC-treated mice. No significant toxicity or organ damage was observed. BMΦDCs are a promising immunotherapeutic approach for HNSCC, demonstrating superior antitumor efficacy, enhanced immune responses, and excellent biosafety.

"Conventional therapies for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a serious worldwide health problem, are frequently constrained by inadequate targeting and serious side effects. Drug delivery systems (DDS) based on nanoparticles provide a possible substitute by improving drug stability, target accuracy, and lowering toxicity. By addressing issues like irregular vasculature and thick tumor matrices, these methods allow for more effective medication administration. For instance, the delivery of cisplatin via liposomes, as opposed to free drug formulations, results in a 40% improvement in tumor suppression. Likewise, compared to traditional techniques, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles can produce up to 2.3 times more intertumoral drug accumulation. These platforms have effectively administered natural substances like curcumin and chemotherapeutics like paclitaxel, enhancing therapeutic results while reducing adverse effects. Despite their promise, several types of nanoparticles have drawbacks. For example, PLGA nanoparticles have scaling issues because of their complicated production, whereas liposomes are quickly removed from circulation. In preclinical investigations, functionalized nanoparticles-like EGFR-targeted gold nanoparticles-improve selectivity and effectiveness by obtaining up to 90% receptor binding. By preferentially accumulating in tumors via the increased permeability and retention (EPR) effect, nanoparticles also improve immunotherapy and radiation. Mechanistically, they increase the death of cancer cells by causing DNA damage, interfering with cell division, and producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). There are still issues with toxicity (such as the buildup of metallic nanoparticles in the liver) and large-scale manufacturing. Nevertheless, developments in multifunctional platforms and stimuli-responsive nanoparticles show promise for getting over these obstacles.

"Tissue-resident memory T (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells are well reported as a strong protective first line of defense against foreign antigens in non-lymphoid tissues. Moreover, T<sub>RM</sub> cells have demonstrated critical protective roles in antitumor immunity, contributing to enhanced survival and tumor growth inhibition across various cancer types. However, surprisingly, recent studies suggest that T<sub>RM</sub> cells can exhibit paradoxical effects, potentially promoting tumor progression under certain conditions and leading to adverse outcomes during antitumor immune responses. Understanding the complexities of T<sub>RM</sub> cell functions will enable us to harness their potential in advancing cancer immunotherapy more effectively. Therefore, this review comprehensively investigates the dual roles of T<sub>RM</sub> cells in different tumor contexts, highlighting their protective functions in combating cancers and their unfavorable potential to exacerbate tumor development.

"Chronic spontaneous urticarial (CSU) is defined as the appearance of wheals and /or angioedema for a total duration of six weeks or more. CSU affects approximately 15-25% of the population, influencing the quality of patients' life. This study aimed to evaluate interleukin 13 (IL-13) versus transforming growth factor Beta (TGF-ß) as a prognostic factor in the management of CSU. The study was designed as a cohort study, including 40 patients with CSU recruited from the allergy and immunology outpatient clinic at Ain Shams University Hospitals from 2022 and 2023. Also, the study included 25 normal subjects as a control group, matched with patients for age and sex, were recruited from healthy relatives of patients, hospital workers and nursing staff. Serum IL-13 and TGF-ß were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at baseline, six-month follow-up after receiving subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy. The mean serum level of IL-13 at the start was 30.6 pg/ml and 22.1 pg/ml after 6 months , which was significantly higher in the CSU group than in the control group (4.7 pg/ml) (p < 0.001). The mean serum level of TGF-ß at the start was 106.6 ng/ml and 114.9 ng/ml after 6 months , which was significantly higher in the CSU group than in the control group (59.1 ng/ml)(p < 0.001).

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly advanced cancer therapy, yet their efficacy in tumors with low tumor mutational burden (TMB) remains suboptimal. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the impact of somatic mutations on overall survival (OS) in TMB-low patients treated with ICIs and to explore the potential for personalized treatment selection through machine learning. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 1172 TMB-low (TMB < 10 mutations per megabase) patients with cancer receiving ICIs, examining the association between specific gene mutations and OS. Additionally, we developed a decision tree model (DTM) to predict OS based on clinical features and tumor mutational profiles. Our findings reveal that mutations in DAXX, HLA-A, H3C2, IGF1R, CTNNB1, SMARCA4, KMT2D, and TP53 are significantly associated with poorer survival outcomes in the multivariate analysis. Remarkably, for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, VHL mutations predicted improved OS following ICI even when adjusted for age, sex, and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in both multivariate analysis and the DTM model. These results reinforce the prevailing notion that TMB alone does not predict ICI response, highlighting the critical role of individual gene mutations in TMB-low tumors under ICI therapy. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the promise of machine learning models in optimizing ICI treatment decisions, paving the way for more precise and effective therapeutic strategies in this patient population.",Immunotherapy,immune checkpoint inhibitors icis significantly advanced cancer therapy yet efficacy tumors low tumor mutational burden tmb remains suboptimal study aimed elucidate impact somatic mutations overall survival os tmblow patients treated icis explore potential personalized treatment selection machine learning conducted comprehensive analysis tmblow tmb mutations per megabase patients cancer receiving icis examining association specific gene mutations os additionally developed decision tree model dtm predict os based clinical features tumor mutational profiles findings reveal mutations daxx hlaa hc igfr ctnnb smarca kmtd tp significantly associated poorer survival outcomes multivariate analysis remarkably renal cell carcinoma rcc patients vhl mutations predicted improved os following ici even adjusted age sex microsatellite instability msi status multivariate analysis dtm model results reinforce prevailing notion tmb alone predict ici response highlighting critical role individual gene mutations tmblow tumors ici therapy furthermore study demonstrates promise machine learning models optimizing ici treatment decisions paving way precise effective therapeutic strategies patient population,Immunotherapy
"To elucidate the prognostic effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on renal cell carcinoma. CAFs and stromal scores were calculated using various algorithms including Estimating the Proportions of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP counter), Tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) and xCell. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to determine the CAF-associated modules and key genes. The functional pathways of key genes in important CAF modules were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. CAF-associated signatures were established through univariate Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) analyses. Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were carried out to assess the predictive value of CAF signatures. WGCNA analysis distinguished several CAF-associated modules for renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), renal chromophobe cell carcinoma (KICH) and renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) respectively. CAF signatures were established containing two and four genes for KIRC and KIRP, respectively. In KIRC and KIRP, patients with high-risk scores had unfavorable outcome than those with low-risk scores. Additionally, in both KIRC and KIRP, the ratio of patients responding to immunotherapy was obviously higher in low-risk group than in high-risk group.

"Gangliosides, sialylated glycosphingolipids abundant in the nervous system, play crucial roles in neurotransmission, interaction with regulatory proteins, cell-cell recognition, and signaling. Altered gangliosides expression has been correlated with pathological processes, including cancer, inflammatory disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Gangliosides are important endogenous ligands of Siglecs (Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins), I-type lectins mostly expressed by immune cells, that specifically recognize sialylated glycans. Siglec-7, an inhibitory immune receptor on human natural killer cells, represents a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. Notably, the expression of Siglec-7 ligands is high in various cancers, such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma and lead to tumor immune evasion. Siglec-7 binds the disialylated ganglioside GD3, a tumor-associated antigen overexpressed on cancer cells to suppress immune responses. Using a combination of structural biology techniques, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), biophysical, and computational methods, the binding of Siglec-7 to GD3 and Gb3 derivatives is investigated, revealing the importance of ligand conformation in modulating binding energetics and affinity. The greater flexibility of Gb3 derivatives appears to negatively impact binding entropy, leading to lower affinity compared to GD3. A thorough understanding of these interactions could contribute to elucidating molecular mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and facilitate the development of ganglioside-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.",Immunotherapy,gangliosides sialylated glycosphingolipids abundant nervous system play crucial roles neurotransmission interaction regulatory proteins cellcell recognition signaling altered gangliosides expression correlated pathological processes including cancer inflammatory disorders autoimmune diseases gangliosides important endogenous ligands siglecs sialic acidbinding immunoglobulintype lectins itype lectins mostly expressed immune cells specifically recognize sialylated glycans siglec inhibitory immune receptor human natural killer cells represents potential target tumor immunotherapy notably expression siglec ligands high various cancers pancreatic cancer melanoma lead tumor immune evasion siglec binds disialylated ganglioside gd tumorassociated antigen overexpressed cancer cells suppress immune responses using combination structural biology techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance nmr biophysical computational methods binding siglec gd gb derivatives investigated revealing importance ligand conformation modulating binding energetics affinity greater flexibility gb derivatives appears negatively impact binding entropy leading lower affinity compared gd thorough understanding interactions could contribute elucidating molecular mechanisms cancer immune evasion facilitate development gangliosidebased diagnostic therapeutic strategies cancer,Immunotherapy
"Radioresistance presents a substantial obstacle to achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes for breast cancer treatment. In this study, we develop a cancer cell membrane (CM) - coated nanozyme system (MPPC@CM), specifically designed for radioimmunotherapy to address this issue. This innovative system involves the in situ reduction of platinum and palladium on mesoporous silica nanospheres, followed by functionalization with cinnamaldehyde via surface grafting. The CM coating endows the nanozyme with enhanced tumor-specific targeting capability due to its homing properties. Upon uptake by tumor cells, MPPC@CM catalytically generates O<sub>2</sub> from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, mitigating the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and reducing radioresistance.     The intracellular glutathione depletion mediated by Michael addition reactions concurrently disrupts endogenous antioxidant defenses against reactive oxygen species (ROS). This redox imbalance is synergistically amplified through nanozyme-mediated catalytic activities including both peroxidase-like and oxidase-like functions. The resultant massive ROS accumulation establishes a self-reinforcing oxidative cascade that ultimately induces functional inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4. The immunosuppressive environment is remodeled by this disturbance in redox balance, which accelerates ferroptosis and increases CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration and dendritic cell maturation.

"Plasmodium radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) confer sterile protection in mammalian hosts. The duration of protection is affected by the dose of RAS, the route of immunization, and the timing of primary challenge (PC). Giving PC shortly after the last Plasmodium berghei (Pb) RAS immunization of C75BL/6 mice led to the long-term sterile protection, whereas delaying PC beyond 6 months resulted in parasitemia. The mechanisms responsible for the divergent outcome remain unknown. Because liver effector/memory CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells are associated with lasting protection, herein we asked if any functions of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells would be diminished or lost by delaying PC. Using the Pb protection model, we characterized functional attributes and phenotypes of liver and spleen CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells following early and delayed PC. Compared with CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells before the challenge, liver KLRG-1<sup>int</sup>CD107<sup>+</sup> and IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells increased after early but decreased following delayed PC.

"The immune checkpoint protein, CD112 receptor (CD112R, also known as PVRIG), suppresses T and NK cell activation upon binding to tumor-expressed CD112 (Nectin-2) ligands. Here, we determine the structure of the CD112-CD112R complex and use it to guide the engineering of multiple CD112-targeting immunotherapy candidates. The 2.2 Å-resolution crystal structure reveals an antiparallel, lock-and-key binding mode in which CD112R disrupts CD112 homodimerization.

In one such approach, the ErbB2 (HER2)-specific CAR-NK cell line NK-92/5.28.z is under investigation as an off-the-shelf therapy in a phase I trial in glioblastoma patients. To evaluate activity of NK-92/5.28.z cells against ErbB2-positive breast cancer, here we developed an organoid model derived from CKP mice that allows conditional activation of oncogenic driver mutations. Expression of ErbB2 and Cre recombinase in CKP mammary epithelial cells induced malignant transformation, with the resulting EC-CKP cells characterized by neoplastic morphology, loss of p53 and constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway. NK-92/5.28.z cells demonstrated potent CAR-mediated cytotoxicity against EC-CKP organoids, with tumor cell lysis dependent on exposure time and organoid size. In vivo passaging of EC-CKP organoids revealed cellular plasticity and induced an EMT phenotype associated with increased resistance to standard therapies. Importantly, NK-92/5.28.z cells retained high and specific cytotoxicity against these breast cancer cells in vitro and in an aggressive organoid-based in vivo mouse model that reflects advanced-stage disease.

"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology holds significant potential for modulating protein homeostasis and treating diseases. However, current methods for degrading membrane protein highly depend on the lysosome-targeting ligands or membrane receptors. In this study, we present a set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi-TACs) for tumor-specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of tumor cell membrane. The multi-TACs are synthesized by copolymerization of small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor BMS-1 with acid-responsive monomers. The chemical structures of the multi-TACs are optimized by investigating the correlation between PD-L1 degradation efficacy and the key parameters including acid-sensitive moieties, BMS-1 valences and spacer lengths. Mechanistic study reveals that the multi-TACs highly efficiently degrade PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways, which differ significantly from the reported strategies for membrane protein degradation. The outperformed multi-TAC GG56 with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme-sensitivity dramatically reduces PD-L1 levels and suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of B16-F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast tumors. Furthermore, GG56 serves as a versatile nanoplatform for combinatory chemo-immunotherapy and radio-immunotherapy of 4T1 breast tumor by co-delivery of chemotherapeutic and radio-sensitizer, respectively.",Immunotherapy,targeted protein degradation tpd technology holds significant potential modulating protein homeostasis treating diseases however current methods degrading membrane protein highly depend lysosometargeting ligands membrane receptors study present set multivalent targeting chimeras multitacs tumorspecific degradation programmed death ligand pdl surface tumor cell membrane multitacs synthesized copolymerization small molecule pdl inhibitor bms acidresponsive monomers chemical structures multitacs optimized investigating correlation pdl degradation efficacy key parameters including acidsensitive moieties bms valences spacer lengths mechanistic study reveals multitacs highly efficiently degrade pdl surface tumor cells via adsorptionmediated endocytosis lysosomal degradation pathways differ significantly reported strategies membrane protein degradation outperformed multitac gg tumor extracellular acidity enzymesensitivity dramatically reduces pdl levels suppresses tumor growth mouse models bf melanoma breast tumors furthermore gg serves versatile nanoplatform combinatory chemoimmunotherapy radioimmunotherapy breast tumor codelivery chemotherapeutic radiosensitizer respectively,Immunotherapy
"Epcutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT) is a novel, non-oral route of allergen immunotherapy, utilizing the skin and its robust density of epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) for antigen presentation. This space is non-vascularized and impermeable, which limits allergen exposure into the bloodstream but preserves antigen presentation to regional lymph nodes to generate gut-homing regulatory T cells. The EPIT patch utilizes natural water loss from the skin to absorb electrosprayed allergen through condensation. EPIT represents an alternative, non-oral route of immunotherapy for food allergy, with good efficacy and strong safety profiles across multiple phase 2 and 3 studies for milk and peanut. Efficacy appears the best in very young children (1-3 years old), which has been shown to continue to enhance with extended treatment duration up to 36 months. Efficacy in slightly older children ages 4-11 years of age is less clear, but appears to be better in children ages 4-7 years of age. In clinical trials of milk and peanut EPIT, most subjects experienced adverse effects, mainly mild-to-moderate skin reactions localized around the patch placement site, which improve with continued duration of wear. Rates of treatment-related anaphylaxis have been very low across all studies and ages, ranging from 1.6% to 4%, and were lowest in the infant and toddler population. While further studies of safety (1- to 3-year-olds) and efficacy (4- to 7-year-olds) are ongoing, EPIT is a potentially valuable addition to the current landscape of food allergy therapies, in particular for infants and toddlers where families may be seeking a non-oral route of treatment.",Immunotherapy,epcutaneous immunotherapy epit novel nonoral route allergen immunotherapy utilizing skin robust density epidermal langerhans cells lc antigen presentation space nonvascularized impermeable limits allergen exposure bloodstream preserves antigen presentation regional lymph nodes generate guthoming regulatory cells epit patch utilizes natural water loss skin absorb electrosprayed allergen condensation epit represents alternative nonoral route immunotherapy food allergy good efficacy strong safety profiles across multiple phase studies milk peanut efficacy appears best young children years old shown continue enhance extended treatment duration months efficacy slightly older children ages years age less clear appears better children ages years age clinical trials milk peanut epit subjects experienced adverse effects mainly mildtomoderate skin reactions localized around patch placement site improve continued duration wear rates treatmentrelated anaphylaxis low across studies ages ranging lowest infant toddler population studies safety yearolds efficacy yearolds ongoing epit potentially valuable addition current landscape food allergy therapies particular infants toddlers families may seeking nonoral route treatment,Immunotherapy
"Parainfluenza viruses are a common cause of respiratory illness in many species. In this study, experimental, alphavirus-derived RNA particle vaccines either with or without adjuvant were evaluated against porcine parainfluenza virus 1 (PPIV1) challenge and compared to live virus exposure. Groups of ten, three-week-old pigs were vaccinated intramuscularly with an adjuvanted RNA particle (RPAdj/C) or non-adjuvanted RP (RP/C) or administered an intranasal live exposure (LE/C) dose of PPIV1 at 0- and 21-days post vaccination (DPV) followed by challenge with PPIV1 at 40 DPV. In addition, two groups were included as non-vaccinated, non-challenged (NV/NC) and non-vaccinated, challenged (NV/C) controls. Intranasal virus exposure and RP vaccination, regardless of adjuvant, reduced PPIV1 shedding in nasal swabs by 5 days post inoculation (DPI). All vaccinated or exposed pigs seroconverted as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum virus neutralization. The antibody isotype detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) LE/C was predominantly IgA while RP vaccination induced an IgG response. Reduced PPIV1 antigen was observed in the LE/C, RP/C and RPAdj/C groups in lung, trachea, or nasal turbinate epithelium. Additionally, the RPAdj vaccine significantly reduced nasal shedding compared to NV/C pigs although not as much as LE/C pigs.

"Vaccination remains the most effective strategy for preventing infectious diseases. Subunit vaccines, which consist of antigenic components derived from pathogens, offer significant advantages in terms of biosafety, ease of preparation, and scalability. However, subunit vaccines often exhibit lower immunogenicity than whole-pathogen vaccines do. To address this limitation, coupling antigens with nanoparticles has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing immune responses by mimicking pathogen structures and improving antigen presentation. This study evaluated the stability of ferritin (F-nps) and encapsulin (E-nps) nanoparticles and their efficient uptake by bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated their effective targeting of lymph nodes. The African swine fever virus C129R protein was conjugated to ferritin and encapsulin nanoparticles to assess its ability to enhance antigen-specific immune responses. In murine models, both F-nps and E-nps significantly increased the immunogenicity of the C129R antigen, highlighting their potential as effective vaccine delivery systems. These findings underscore the promise of ferritin and encapsulin nanoparticles as delivery platforms for enhancing antigen immunogenicity and pave the way for the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines.",Immunotherapy,vaccination remains effective strategy preventing infectious diseases subunit vaccines consist antigenic components derived pathogens offer significant advantages terms biosafety ease preparation scalability however subunit vaccines often exhibit lower immunogenicity wholepathogen vaccines address limitation coupling antigens nanoparticles emerged promising strategy enhancing immune responses mimicking pathogen structures improving antigen presentation study evaluated stability ferritin fnps encapsulin enps nanoparticles efficient uptake bonemarrowderived dendritic cells bmdcs vitro vivo studies demonstrated effective targeting lymph nodes african swine fever virus cr protein conjugated ferritin encapsulin nanoparticles assess ability enhance antigenspecific immune responses murine models fnps enps significantly increased immunogenicity cr antigen highlighting potential effective vaccine delivery systems findings underscore promise ferritin encapsulin nanoparticles delivery platforms enhancing antigen immunogenicity pave way development nanoparticlebased vaccines,Immunotherapy
"<i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</i> (<i>Mhyo</i>) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) are critical pathogens in the swine industry, both contributing significantly to the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC).

We present the efficacy of the first commercial combined vaccine prepared of a genotype PCV2d strain and <i>Mhyo</i> and tested against experimental challenge infections with target pathogens in comparative trials with other commercial products. In these studies, three-week-old piglets were vaccinated according to the manufacturers' instructions. Five weeks later, they were challenged with two <i>Mhyo</i> strains over three consecutive days or with a PCV2d strain once. Positive controls included challenged pigs without prior vaccination, while non-vaccinated/non-challenged pigs served as negative controls. The key parameters measured were lung lesion scores and seroconversion for <i>Mhyo</i>, and viraemia, rectal shedding, lymph node and lung viral content, and seroconversion for PCV2.

"Between 2006 and 2010, northwestern Europe experienced its first significant bluetongue virus (BTV) outbreak, driven by the spread of BTV-8, which had major repercussions on the European livestock sector. While BTV-3 was first identified in Europe in Italy in 2017, a new introduction of the virus was reported in 2023, in the Netherlands, and subsequently spread rapidly across the continent. A limited number of BTV-3 outbreaks were notified in Belgium in 2023, leading to the loss of its BTV-free status. In the following year, 2024, the virus spread throughout the country in a short time period. This study describes the impact of BTV-3 circulation in Belgium in 2024, detailing both its geographic spread and the associated increase in mortality, reduced births recorded, and decline in milk production among ruminants. Furthermore, preliminary results on the effectiveness of field vaccination and maternal immunity transfer are presented, as well as critical gaps that hinder the development of a robust, evidence-based management strategy. As the epidemiological situation is expected to become more complex in the future, due to the co-circulation of multiple BTV serotypes and other <i>Culicoides</i>-borne diseases, such as EHDV, effective collaboration and communication among stakeholders and international authorities will be crucial for implementing measures to mitigate the spread of these diseases.",Immunotherapy,northwestern europe experienced first significant bluetongue virus btv outbreak driven spread btv major repercussions european livestock sector btv first identified europe italy new introduction virus reported netherlands subsequently spread rapidly across continent limited number btv outbreaks notified belgium leading loss btvfree status following year virus spread throughout country short time period study describes impact btv circulation belgium detailing geographic spread associated increase mortality reduced births recorded decline milk production among ruminants furthermore preliminary results effectiveness field vaccination maternal immunity transfer presented well critical gaps hinder development robust evidencebased management strategy epidemiological situation expected become complex future due cocirculation multiple btv serotypes iculicoidesiborne diseases ehdv effective collaboration communication among stakeholders international authorities crucial implementing measures mitigate spread diseases,Immunotherapy
"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the sixth most prevalent type of cancer worldwide and is associated with low five-year survival rates.

"This review summarizes the findings of veterinary clinical trials on immunogene therapy published between 2017 and 2024. Various tumor types, including melanoma (canine and feline), mastocytoma (canine), mammary adenocarcinoma (canine), osteosarcoma (canine), and sarcoid (equine), were treated using diverse strategies. Non-viral vectors were predominantly used to deliver genes encoding tumor-associated antigens, cytokines, or suicide enzymes. Among these non-viral methods, electrotransfer was the most commonly employed technique for introducing therapeutic genes into cells. Generally, these procedures resulted in minimal or no adverse side effects, and treated animals often showed significant improvements, such as enhanced quality of life, delayed or suppressed tumor recurrence or metastasis, and increased survival times.

The heterogeneity among tumor subtypes and the emergence of treatment resistance have raised significant concerns regarding the long-term efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. In response to these challenges, drug repurposing strategies-utilizing existing drugs in novel therapeutic contexts-have gained increasing attention. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the combined application of doxorubicin (DX) and thymoquinone (TQ) on ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (OVCAR3). <b>Methods:</b> OVCAR3 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed using the MTT assay following treatment with various concentrations of DX and TQ. NucBlue immunofluorescence staining was employed to examine nuclear morphology and to identify apoptosis-associated changes. Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was per-formed to evaluate the expression levels of apoptosis-related and oncogenic pathway genes, including RAF, RAS, Bcl-2, and Bax. <b>Results:</b> The results demonstrated that the combination of DX and TQ significantly reduced OVCAR3 cell viability and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a downregulation of RAS, RAF, and Bcl-2 expression, along with an upregulation of Bax, indicating activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that thymoquinone exerts an-ti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects by modulating the RAS/RAF signaling cascade. Furthermore, the co-administration of thymoquinone with doxorubicin potentiated these effects, suggesting a synergistic interaction between the two agents. <b>Conclusions:</b> Histopathological and molecular evaluations further confirmed the activation of apoptosis and the suppression of key oncogenic pathways. Collectively, these results underscore the therapeutic potential of thymoquinone as both a monotherapy and an adjuvant to conventional chemotherapy, warranting further validation in preclinical and clinical studies.",Immunotherapy,bbackgroundobjectivesb ovarian cancer remains one commonly diagnosed malignancies among women worldwide heterogeneity among tumor subtypes emergence treatment resistance raised significant concerns regarding longterm efficacy chemotherapy radiotherapy immunotherapy response challenges drug repurposing strategiesutilizing existing drugs novel therapeutic contextshave gained increasing attention study aimed investigate cytotoxic apoptotic effects combined application doxorubicin dx thymoquinone tq ovarian adenocarcinoma cells ovcar bmethodsb ovcar cells cultured rpmi medium supplemented fetal bovine serum fbs penicillinstreptomycin cell viability proliferation assessed using mtt assay following treatment various concentrations dx tq nucblue immunofluorescence staining employed examine nuclear morphology identify apoptosisassociated changes additionally quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction qrtpcr performed evaluate expression levels apoptosisrelated oncogenic pathway genes including raf ras bcl bax bresultsb results demonstrated combination dx tq significantly reduced ovcar cell viability induced apoptosis dosedependent manner qrtpcr analysis revealed downregulation ras raf bcl expression along upregulation bax indicating activation intrinsic apoptotic pathway findings suggest thymoquinone exerts antiproliferative proapoptotic effects modulating rasraf signaling cascade furthermore coadministration thymoquinone doxorubicin potentiated effects suggesting synergistic interaction two agents bconclusionsb histopathological molecular evaluations confirmed activation apoptosis suppression key oncogenic pathways collectively results underscore therapeutic potential thymoquinone monotherapy adjuvant conventional chemotherapy warranting validation preclinical clinical studies,Immunotherapy

"<b>Background</b>: In recent years, tumor vaccines have demonstrated unexpected success in cancer treatment. However, it still faces several challenges, including insufficient antigen and adjuvant delivery, unsuitable antigen delivery system, and inadequate antigen-presenting cell (APC) maturation. Antigenic adjuvant co-delivery tactics could be one way to enhance APC maturation. <b>Methods</b>: Membrane-fused nanovesicles were synthesized by separating melanoma cell membranes from BCG cytoplasmic membranes. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy were used for measuring the vesicles' size and shape. The uptake of vesicles by mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and the activation of DC cells by vesicles were verified in vitro. In order to further confirm the material's capacity to activate the immune system and its ability to inhibit tumor growth, the activation of DC and T cells in mouse draining lymph nodes and the concentration of anti-tumor cytokines were measured. <b>Results</b>: The hybrid vesicles were homogeneous in size and could facilitate phagocytosis by dendritic cells (DCs). They could also effectively activate DCs and T cells in vitro and in vivo, eliciting anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, the vesicles demonstrated satisfying biosafety with no major side effects. <b>Conclusions</b>: Motivated by the myth of the Trojan Horse, we created an antigen-adjuvant-integrated nanovesicle that merges the BCG cytomembrane with the tumor cell membrane, which can achieve immune cell stimulation and tumor antigen delivery simultaneously.

"<b>Background:</b> Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent form of kidney cancer, accounting for over 75% of cases worldwide. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have emerged as promising agents for ccRCC treatment, particularly in combination with immunotherapy or targeted therapies. Tubacin, a potent HDAC6 inhibitor, has demonstrated potent anticancer activity but faces therapeutic limitations due to its hydrophobic nature and poor solubility, which hinder its effective drug delivery. This study explores liposomal encapsulation as a strategy to improve tubacin delivery; <b>Methods:</b> Liposomes were prepared using the ethanol injection method followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Using the Plackett-Burman Design, we identified a promising liposomal formulation and evaluated its biological activity in vitro; <b>Results:</b> However, initial formulations reduced the mitochondrial activity to 30% in healthy renal cell lines. To mitigate this, we optimized the formulation by reducing tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) content and incorporating Kolliphor<sup>®</sup> as an additional surfactant. This optimized formulation significantly reduced toxicity in noncancerous cells, with up to 80% of mitochondrial activity conserved while retaining key properties for therapeutic application; <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings demonstrate that liposomal encapsulation enhances the safety and delivery of hydrophobic drugs like tubacin.

"Non-invasive phototherapy includes modalities such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). When combined with tumor immunotherapy, these therapeutic approaches have demonstrated significant efficacy in treating advanced malignancies, thus attracting considerable attention from the scientific community. However, the progress of these therapies is hindered by inherent limitations and potential adverse effects. Recent findings indicate that certain therapeutic strategies, including phototherapy, can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby opening new avenues for the integration of phototherapy with tumor immunotherapy. Currently, the development of biofilm nanomaterial-encapsulated drug delivery systems has reached a mature stage. Immune cell membrane-encapsulated nano-photosensitizers hold great promise, as they can enhance the tumor immune microenvironment. Based on bioengineering technology, immune cell membranes can be designed according to the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing the targeting and immune properties of nano-photosensitizers. Additionally, the space provided by the immune cell membrane allows for the co-encapsulation of immunotherapeutic agents and chemotherapy drugs, achieving a synergistic therapeutic effect. At the same time, the timing of photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be precisely controlled to regulate the action timing of both immunotherapeutic and chemotherapy drugs.

"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The development of effective therapies for brain disorders is highly correlated with the ability of drugs or nanosystems to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has been limited. Recently, carbon dots (CDs) have been receiving attention to be used as BBB-crossing theranostic agents due to their inherent advantages, such as low size, excellent biocompatibility, high quantum yield (QY), tunable fluorescence, high drug loading, and relatively easy synthesis at low cost. The aim of this study was to design CDs with precisely controlled fluorescence properties for advanced bioimaging and an in-depth assessment of BBB permeability. <b>Methods</b>: CDs were synthesized using a microwave-assisted approach, optimized through microwaves' irradiation time, and employing citric acid, urea, and sodium fluoride as precursors. The optimized sample was labeled as NF-CD. <b>Results</b>: A comprehensive physicochemical, photoluminescence, and biological characterization revealed the ability of NF-CD to diffuse across a neuromimetic-BBB model, mainly due to their small size (average diameter of 4.0 ± 1.1 nm), exhibiting excitation-dependent fluorescence in the blue and green wavelengths, high biocompatibility and QY, and exceptional photostability. <b>Conclusions</b>: Owing to the exceptional fluorescence characteristics and biological compatibility, NF-CD presents promising opportunities in theranostic applications, particularly in brain-targeted bioimaging, nanocarrier-based drug and immunotherapy delivery, early-stage diagnostics, and personalized medicine. NF-CD's ability to cross the BBB further underscores the relevance of pioneering nanomaterial-based strategies for neurological disorder diagnostics and precision-targeted therapeutic interventions.

"<b>Background</b>: Mucin-1 (MUC1) is a glycoprotein that is hypoglycosylated and overexpressed in most adenocarcinomas, making it a promising target for cancer vaccines. Our group previously demonstrated that C3 (OPSS)-liposomes enhance antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via the complement C3 pathway and, when combined with toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, reduce tumor growth in murine cancer models. <b>Methods</b>: In the present study, we evaluate the immunogenicity of MUC1 peptide vaccines encapsulated in C3-liposomes, with and without TLR agonists, using MUC1-tolerant transgenic mice challenged with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC.MUC1) cells. To assess vaccine effectiveness, tumor volumes were measured, and flow cytometry and ELISA and ELISPOT assays were used to assess the immune response. <b>Results</b>: Both male and female C57BL/6 transgenic mice vaccinated with MUC1 C3-liposomes developed significantly smaller tumors than those vaccinated with free MUC1 peptide or PBS. Notably, a sex-dependent response emerged in mice vaccinated with MUC1 C3-liposomes with TLR agonists (TLR4, TLR7/8, and TLR9); male mice exhibited greater tumor suppression than females. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that female mice had significantly higher levels of CD11b<sup>+</sup>, LY6C<sup>+</sup>, and LY6G<sup>+</sup> MDSC cells, suggesting a potential mechanism for the sex difference. Additionally, MUC1 C3-liposome vaccination elicited robust adaptive immune responses, including significantly higher levels of IFN-γ-producing T cells and MUC1-specific IgG antibodies compared to non-encapsulated MUC1 or TLR adjuvant-only formulations. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings underscore the potential of C3-liposome-based antigen vaccines to enhance anti-tumor immunity and highlight the impact of sex differences in vaccine efficacy.",Immunotherapy,bbackgroundb mucin muc glycoprotein hypoglycosylated overexpressed adenocarcinomas making promising target cancer vaccines group previously demonstrated c opssliposomes enhance antigen uptake antigenpresenting cells apcs via complement c pathway combined tolllike receptor tlr agonists reduce tumor growth murine cancer models bmethodsb present study evaluate immunogenicity muc peptide vaccines encapsulated cliposomes without tlr agonists using muctolerant transgenic mice challenged lewis lung carcinoma llcmuc cells assess vaccine effectiveness tumor volumes measured flow cytometry elisa elispot assays used assess immune response bresultsb male female cbl transgenic mice vaccinated muc cliposomes developed significantly smaller tumors vaccinated free muc peptide pbs notably sexdependent response emerged mice vaccinated muc cliposomes tlr agonists tlr tlr tlr male mice exhibited greater tumor suppression females flow cytometry analysis revealed female mice significantly higher levels cdbsupsup lycsupsup lygsupsup mdsc cells suggesting potential mechanism sex difference additionally muc cliposome vaccination elicited robust adaptive immune responses including significantly higher levels ifnproducing cells mucspecific igg antibodies compared nonencapsulated muc tlr adjuvantonly formulations bconclusionsb findings underscore potential cliposomebased antigen vaccines enhance antitumor immunity highlight impact sex differences vaccine efficacy,Immunotherapy
"The mRNA- and DNA-based ""genetic"" COVID-19 vaccines can induce a broad range of adverse events (AEs), with statistics showing significant variation depending on the timing and data analysis methods used. Focusing only on lipid nanoparticle-enclosed mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccines, this review traces the evolution of statistical conclusions on the prevalence of AEs and incidents associated with these vaccines, from initial underestimation of atypical, severe toxicities to recent claims suggesting the possible contribution of COVID-19 vaccinations to the excess deaths observed in many countries over the past few years. Among hundreds of different AEs listed in Pfizer's pharmacovigilance survey, the present analysis categorizes the main symptoms according to organ systems, with nearly all of them being affected. Using data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and a global vaccination dataset, a comparison of the prevalence and incidence rates of AEs induced by genetic versus flu vaccines revealed an average 26-fold increase in AEs with the use of genetic vaccines. The difference is especially pronounced in the case of severe 'Brighton-listed' AEs, which are also observed in COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions. Among these, the increases in incidence rates relative to flu vaccines, given as x-fold rises, were 1152x, 455x, 226x, 218x, 162x, 152x, and 131x for myocarditis, thrombosis, death, myocardial infarction, tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypertension, respectively. The review delineates the concept that genetic vaccines can be regarded as prophylactic immuno-gene therapies and that the observed chronic disabling AEs might be categorized as iatrogenic orphan diseases. It also examines the unique vaccine characteristics that could be causally related to abnormal immune responses which potentially lead to adverse events and complications.

"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Cancer and related treatments can impair body composition (BC), increasing the risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, poor prognosis, and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). To enhance BC parameter interpretation through Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), we developed a predictive model based on unsupervised approaches including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering for sarcopenia risk in cancer patients at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS ""Fondazione G. Pascale"" (Naples). <b>Methods</b>: Sarcopenia and malnutrition risks were assessed using the NRS-2002 and SARC-F questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, and BIA. HRQoL was evaluated with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. PCA and clustering analysis were performed to identify different BC profiles. <b>Results:</b> Data from 879 cancer patients (mean age: 63 ± 12.5 years) were collected: 117 patients (13%) and 128 (15%) were at risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, respectively. PCA analysis identified three main components, and k-means determined three clusters, namely HMP (High Muscle Profile), MMP (Moderate Muscle Profile), and LMP (Low Muscle Profile). Patients in LMP were older, with a higher prevalence of comorbidities, malnutrition, and sarcopenia. In the multivariable analysis, age, lung cancer site, diabetes, and malnutrition risk were significantly associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia; among the clusters, patients in LMP had an increased risk of sarcopenia (+62%, <i>p</i> = 0.006). <b>Conclusions</b>: The NUTRISCREEN project, part of the ONCOCAMP study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06270602), provides a personalized nutritional pathway for early screening of malnutrition and sarcopenia.

"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of gene expression, influencing chromatin remodeling and playing a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Aberrant HDAC activity has been linked to cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and inflammatory diseases, making these enzymes attractive therapeutic targets. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have gained significant attention, particularly those containing zinc-binding groups (ZBGs), which interact directly with the catalytic zinc ion in the enzyme's active site. The structural diversity of ZBGs profoundly impacts the potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetics of HDACis. While hydroxamic acids remain the most widely used ZBGs, their limitations, such as metabolic instability and off-target effects, have driven the development of alternative scaffolds, including <i>ortho</i>-aminoanilides, mercaptoacetamides, alkylhydrazides, oxadiazoles, and more. This review explores the structural and mechanistic aspects of different ZBGs, their interactions with HDAC isoforms, and their influence on inhibitor selectivity. Advances in structure-based drug design have allowed the fine-tuning of HDACi pharmacophores, leading to more selective and efficacious compounds with improved drug-like properties.

"Despite improvements in therapeutic approaches like immunotherapy and gene therapy, cancer still remains a serious threat to world health due to its high incidence and mortality rates. Limitations of conventional therapy include suboptimal targeting, multidrug resistance, and systemic toxicity. A major challenge in current oncology therapies is the development of new delivery methods for antineoplastic drugs that act directly on target. One approach involves the complexation of antitumor drugs with cyclodextrins (CDs) and chitosan (CS) as an attempt to counteract their primary limitations: low water solubility and bioavailability, diminished in vitro and in vivo stability, and high dose-dependent toxicity. All those drawbacks may potentially exclude some therapeutic candidates from clinical trials, thus their integration into smart delivery systems or drug-targeting technologies must be implemented. We intended to overview new drug delivery systems based on chitosan or cyclodextrins with regard to the current diagnosis and cancer management. This narrative review encompasses full-length articles published in English between 2019 and 2025 (including online ahead of print versions) in PubMed-indexed journals, focusing on recent research on the encapsulation of diverse antitumor drugs within those nanosystems that exhibit responsiveness to various stimuli such as pH, redox potential, and folate receptor levels, thereby enhancing the release of bioactive compounds at tumor sites. The majority of the cited references focus on the most notable research, studies of novel applications, and scientific advancements in the field of nanostructures and functional materials employed in oncological therapies over the last six years.

This study aimed to address this issue through two strategies: (1) conjugating albumin-binding molecules to enhance systemic circulation and (2) dimerizing RGD peptides to improve binding affinity via multivalency effects. <b>Methods</b>: Three [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD derivatives were synthesized: [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD<sub>pal</sub> (with palmitic acid), [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD<sub>iba</sub> (with 4-(<i>p</i>-iodophenyl)butyric acid), and [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD<sub>dimer</sub> (a dimeric bicyclic RGD peptide). Their physicochemical properties, α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-selectivity, albumin-binding capacity, and biodistribution were assessed in vitro and in vivo using tumor-bearing mice. Tumor models included α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-high U-87 MG and α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-low A549 xenografts. <b>Results</b>: [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD<sub>pal</sub> and [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD<sub>iba</sub> exhibited prolonged blood retention (30-fold and 55-fold vs. [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD, respectively) and increased tumor accumulation (3.9% ID/g and 3.6% ID/g at 2 h, respectively). Despite improved systemic circulation, tumor-to-blood ratios remained low (<1), indicating limited tumor retention. [<sup>125</sup>I]bcRGD<sub>dimer</sub> achieved significantly greater tumor accumulation (4.2% ID/g at 2 h) and favorable tumor-to-blood (22) and tumor-to-muscle (14) ratios, with a 5.4-fold higher uptake in U-87 MG tumors compared to A549 tumors. <b>Conclusions</b>: Dimerization was more effective than albumin binding in enhancing bcRGD's tumor-targeting potential. The dimeric probe demonstrated improved tumor accumulation, favorable pharmacokinetics, and preserved integrin selectivity.

"Osteosarcoma is recognized as the most prevalent primary bone malignancy, primarily affecting children and adolescents. It is characterized by its aggressive behavior and high metastatic potential, which often leads to poor patient outcomes. Despite advancements in surgical techniques and chemotherapy regimens, the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma remains unsatisfactory, with survival rates plateauing over the past few decades. A significant barrier to effective treatment is the development of chemotherapy resistance, which complicates the management of the disease and contributes to high rates of recurrence. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in osteosarcoma therapy, particularly in overcoming chemotherapy resistance. We begin by discussing the current standard treatment modalities, including surgical resection and conventional chemotherapy agents such as methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. While these approaches have been foundational in managing osteosarcoma, they are often limited by adverse effects and variability in efficacy among patients. To address these challenges, we explore novel pharmacological strategies that aim to enhance treatment outcomes. This includes targeted therapies focusing on specific molecular alterations in osteosarcoma cells and immunotherapeutic approaches designed to harness the body's immune system against tumors. Additionally, we review innovative drug delivery systems that aim to improve the bioavailability and efficacy of existing treatments while minimizing toxicity. The review also assesses the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance, such as drug efflux mechanisms, altered metabolism, and enhanced DNA repair pathways. By synthesizing current research findings, we aim to highlight the potential of new therapeutic agents and strategies for overcoming these resistance mechanisms. Ultimately, this article seeks to inform future research directions and clinical practices, underscoring the need for continued innovation in treating osteosarcoma to improve patient outcomes and survival rates.",Immunotherapy,osteosarcoma recognized prevalent primary bone malignancy primarily affecting children adolescents characterized aggressive behavior high metastatic potential often leads poor patient outcomes despite advancements surgical techniques chemotherapy regimens prognosis patients osteosarcoma remains unsatisfactory survival rates plateauing past decades significant barrier effective treatment development chemotherapy resistance complicates management disease contributes high rates recurrence review article aims provide comprehensive overview recent advancements osteosarcoma therapy particularly overcoming chemotherapy resistance begin discussing current standard treatment modalities including surgical resection conventional chemotherapy agents methotrexate doxorubicin cisplatin approaches foundational managing osteosarcoma often limited adverse effects variability efficacy among patients address challenges explore novel pharmacological strategies aim enhance treatment outcomes includes targeted therapies focusing specific molecular alterations osteosarcoma cells immunotherapeutic approaches designed harness bodys immune system tumors additionally review innovative drug delivery systems aim improve bioavailability efficacy existing treatments minimizing toxicity review also assesses mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance drug efflux mechanisms altered metabolism enhanced dna repair pathways synthesizing current research findings aim highlight potential new therapeutic agents strategies overcoming resistance mechanisms ultimately article seeks inform future research directions clinical practices underscoring need continued innovation treating osteosarcoma improve patient outcomes survival rates,Immunotherapy
"<b>Objective:</b> This review provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action of AGuIX, a clinical-stage theranostic nano-radiosensitizer composed of gadolinium. It covers the steps following the administration, from the internalization in tumor cells to the interaction with X-rays and the subsequent physical, chemical, biological, and immunological events. <b>Results:</b> After intravenous injection, AGuIX accumulates in tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and its specific retention properties allow its persistence in tumors for several days. At the cellular level, the nanomedicine is internalized by endocytic processes and mainly located in the cytoplasm, especially in lysosomes. AGuIX enhances the effects of radiotherapy (RT) at several levels, starting from radiation-matter interactions to a chemical stage of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, followed by a cascade of biological events leading to tumor cell death and immune response. Indeed, AGuIX induces a local increase in radiation dose deposition through the emission of Auger electrons, leading to a subsequent increase in ROS generation. AGuIX also impacts RT-induced biological mechanisms, including DNA damage and cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis, autophagic cell death, and ferroptosis. Last, the combination of AGuIX and RT stimulates an antitumor immune response through the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD), the activation of dendritic and T cells, and the reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into a pro-inflammatory phenotype. <b>Conclusions:</b> AGuIX is a clinical-stage nanoparticle (NP) intravenously administered with pan-cancer potential due to its specific biodistribution properties and a strong ability to amplify RT-induced mechanisms.",Immunotherapy,bobjectiveb review provides overview current knowledge regarding mechanisms action aguix clinicalstage theranostic nanoradiosensitizer composed gadolinium covers steps following administration internalization tumor cells interaction xrays subsequent physical chemical biological immunological events bresultsb intravenous injection aguix accumulates tumors enhanced permeability retention epr effect specific retention properties allow persistence tumors several days cellular level nanomedicine internalized endocytic processes mainly located cytoplasm especially lysosomes aguix enhances effects radiotherapy rt several levels starting radiationmatter interactions chemical stage reactive oxygen species ros production followed cascade biological events leading tumor cell death immune response indeed aguix induces local increase radiation dose deposition emission auger electrons leading subsequent increase ros generation aguix also impacts rtinduced biological mechanisms including dna damage cell death mechanisms apoptosis autophagic cell death ferroptosis last combination aguix rt stimulates antitumor immune response induction immunogenic cell death icd activation dendritic cells reprogramming tumorassociated macrophages tams proinflammatory phenotype bconclusionsb aguix clinicalstage nanoparticle np intravenously administered pancancer potential due specific biodistribution properties strong ability amplify rtinduced mechanisms,Immunotherapy
"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Worldwide, colon cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality, with an increasing incidence influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Despite advances in diagnosis and personalized treatments, challenges remain in improving patient prognosis, particularly in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Bevacizumab (BEV), a monoclonal antibody, is widely used in colorectal cancer treatment. This study aimed to analyze adverse events associated with BEV compared with other therapies based on data from the EudraVigilance (EV) database. <b>Methods:</b> A descriptive and disproportionality analysis was conducted on signals reported in the EV database related to BEV. The study included comparisons with other antineoplastic treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Patient demographics, severity of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and distribution patterns were analyzed to assess the safety profile of BEV in colorectal cancer treatment. <b>Results:</b> The majority of the signals for BEV were from patients aged 18-64 years (39.42%) and 65-85 years (34.08%). Hypertension, thromboembolism, proteinuria, and gastrointestinal disorders have been the most frequently reported. Serious ADRs, including gastrointestinal perforations, hemorrhage, and arterial thromboembolism, were observed in 93.74% of Individual Case Safety Reports. BEV was associated with a higher likelihood of vascular and endocrine disorders compared with chemotherapy and other targeted therapies. Immunotherapy was linked to increased immunological ADRs, while BEV demonstrated fewer immune-related toxicities. <b>Conclusions:</b> Continuous monitoring is necessary to optimize patient management, particularly in elderly patients or those with cardiovascular comorbidities.

"Colorectal cancer burden is a threat to health systems in several countries. As the cost of diagnosing, treating, and managing this cancer is unknown in Antigua and Barbuda, this study aimed to estimate its direct medical cost in this country. We used the prevalence-based cost-of-illness methodology to study data on patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2017 and 2021. Data record abstraction was carried out to determine the five-year prevalence, and a top-down and bottom-up approach was employed to estimate the direct medical costs for colorectal cancer care components. All costs were computed at 2021 price levels and are reported in United States dollars. The total annual direct medical costs for colorectal cancer were estimated at USD 1.14 million (ranging between USD 0.85 million and USD 1.42 million). Major cost drivers were treatment (USD 613,650.01) and post-treatment side-effects care (USD 402,234.50). The overall estimated direct medical unit costs were USD 139,295.58, with the main drivers being surgery (USD 43,467.10), other complications of treatment (USD 28,469.21), and immunotherapy (USD 19,200.00).

"This study examines the barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination among immigrant and refugee populations, with a focus on informing primary healthcare stakeholders on effective strategies to address the health needs of these groups. Although conducted in Canada, the findings are relevant to countries facing similar challenges in promoting vaccine uptake among migrant communities. As part of an evaluation of best practices in COVID-19 vaccination promotion and provision, data were collected using in-depth key informant interviews with a cross-section of primary care stakeholders (n = 11). Key barriers to vaccine promotion and provision included distrust of health and government services, misinformation, lack of vaccine confidence, and access or systems-level barriers. Effective facilitators were relationship-building and equity-driven approaches, such as community engagement and development, culturally and linguistically effective communication, one-on-one supports, and collaboration with community members as valued partners and staff. These strategies were identified as best practices that enhanced vaccine confidence and uptake. The risk and impacts of COVID-19 are disproportionately distributed worldwide, affecting migrant populations in many countries. Primary healthcare stakeholders must understand the barriers and facilitators to vaccine promotion to effectively address health inequalities. Increasing vaccine uptake and confidence among immigrant and refugee populations requires targeted and tailored approaches that are culturally responsive and equity-informed. These findings provide valuable insights for health systems globally, supporting efforts to reduce health inequities by using inclusive vaccination strategies.",Immunotherapy,study examines barriers facilitators covid vaccination among immigrant refugee populations focus informing primary healthcare stakeholders effective strategies address health needs groups although conducted canada findings relevant countries facing similar challenges promoting vaccine uptake among migrant communities part evaluation best practices covid vaccination promotion provision data collected using indepth key informant interviews crosssection primary care stakeholders n key barriers vaccine promotion provision included distrust health government services misinformation lack vaccine confidence access systemslevel barriers effective facilitators relationshipbuilding equitydriven approaches community engagement development culturally linguistically effective communication oneonone supports collaboration community members valued partners staff strategies identified best practices enhanced vaccine confidence uptake risk impacts covid disproportionately distributed worldwide affecting migrant populations many countries primary healthcare stakeholders must understand barriers facilitators vaccine promotion effectively address health inequalities increasing vaccine uptake confidence among immigrant refugee populations requires targeted tailored approaches culturally responsive equityinformed findings provide valuable insights health systems globally supporting efforts reduce health inequities using inclusive vaccination strategies,Immunotherapy
"Vaccinations are among the most effective means of preventing hospitalizations related to infections. Despite this, high hospitalization rates for vaccine-preventable diseases strain available healthcare resources and imply deficiencies in primary care. Barriers to vaccinations exist, such as the recent pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and access to care. This study analyzes hospitalization rates due to vaccine-preventable conditions and identifies factors contributing to an increase in these rates in the southeast United States. This study used data from four different data sources. The data covers four pre-pandemic years (2016 to 2019) and the pandemic period (2020 to 2022). The analysis categorized the numbers and rates of hospitalizations for conditions with an available preventative vaccine across three age groups: pre-school aged children, school-aged children, and adults. Comparisons between school- versus non-school-mandated vaccines and a focus on differences between rural versus urban communities, as well as demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, race, and ethnicity), are included. Chi-squared tests were used to assess differences in this descriptive part of the analysis. Linear multiple regression was used to examine the independent influence of geographic location while accounting for potential longitudinal trends and the dimensions of the SVI, including socioeconomic status, household composition, disability, minority status and language, and household type and transportation. The dataset included data from 22,797,826 inpatient episodes, including 32,358 for which the principal reason for hospitalization was a vaccine-preventable condition, not including COVID-19. The analysis shows a consistent pattern characterized by higher rates of hospitalization for counties classified as rural. The pattern holds for preschool age (<i>p</i> < 0.001), school age (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and adults (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The differences are statistically significant in the white population (<i>p</i> = 0.008); in pre-school children, school-age children, and adults (<i>p</i> < 0.001); in females (<i>p</i> = 0.08 in pre-school, and <i>p</i> = 0.013 in adults); and black adults (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The regression results confirmed the findings of the descriptive analysis, indicating significantly higher rates in rural communities. Finally, the regression analysis also showed significantly higher rates associated with greater social vulnerability. This study highlights gaps in vaccination opportunities. These gaps can be seen geographically and in terms of social vulnerability, affected by factors such as poverty, language barriers, household composition, and access to care. Hospitalizations due to immunizable diseases were found to be higher in rural areas, particularly among adults. Communities with a high SVI show a significant increase in hospitalization rates. Community-engaged vaccination outreach programs and state policies could improve vaccination rates, and therefore, public health in rural areas, reducing hospitalizations, and lowering infectious disease risks in these areas.",Immunotherapy,vaccinations among effective means preventing hospitalizations related infections despite high hospitalization rates vaccinepreventable diseases strain available healthcare resources imply deficiencies primary care barriers vaccinations exist recent pandemic vaccine hesitancy misinformation access care study analyzes hospitalization rates due vaccinepreventable conditions identifies factors contributing increase rates southeast united states study used data four different data sources data covers four prepandemic years pandemic period analysis categorized numbers rates hospitalizations conditions available preventative vaccine across three age groups preschool aged children schoolaged children adults comparisons school versus nonschoolmandated vaccines focus differences rural versus urban communities well demographic characteristics ie gender race ethnicity included chisquared tests used assess differences descriptive part analysis linear multiple regression used examine independent influence geographic location accounting potential longitudinal trends dimensions svi including socioeconomic status household composition disability minority status language household type transportation dataset included data inpatient episodes including principal reason hospitalization vaccinepreventable condition including covid analysis shows consistent pattern characterized higher rates hospitalization counties classified rural pattern holds preschool age ipi school age ipi adults ipi differences statistically significant white population ipi preschool children schoolage children adults ipi females ipi preschool ipi adults black adults ipi regression results confirmed findings descriptive analysis indicating significantly higher rates rural communities finally regression analysis also showed significantly higher rates associated greater social vulnerability study highlights gaps vaccination opportunities gaps seen geographically terms social vulnerability affected factors poverty language barriers household composition access care hospitalizations due immunizable diseases found higher rural areas particularly among adults communities high svi show significant increase hospitalization rates communityengaged vaccination outreach programs state policies could improve vaccination rates therefore public health rural areas reducing hospitalizations lowering infectious disease risks areas,Immunotherapy

"Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPCa) presents de novo or represents significant disease progression and requires systemic treatment. However, progression to castration resistance is inevitable. The treatment landscape has evolved with the introduction of intensified systemic therapy, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with either androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) or cytotoxic chemotherapy (doublet therapy) or combined therapy with both agents (triplet therapy). Landmark trials such as CHAARTED, STAMPEDE, LATITUDE, ENZAMET, and TITAN have established combination therapies as the standard of care, demonstrating significant overall survival benefits. More recently, triplet therapy-integrating ADT, docetaxel, and an ARSI-has emerged as an effective approach, particularly in high-volume metastatic disease, as supported by ARASENS and PEACE-1. Advances in imaging, such as PSMA PET-CT, have improved disease detection, allowing earlier detection of metastasis and appropriate therapy. Similarly, genomic profiling has enabled biomarker-driven, personalized treatment strategies. The role of treatment of the primary tumor, by either radiation therapy or cytoreductive prostatectomy, in low-volume disease continues to be explored. As novel therapies, targeted agents, and immunotherapies undergo investigation, optimizing treatment selection based on disease burden, molecular characteristics, and patient factors will be essential.

"Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to cancer treatment, but only a small percentage of cancer patients benefit from it. To enhance therapeutic outcomes, it is essential to understand factors influencing immune response and tumor progression. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) has been identified as an essential element in immune regulation, with potential implications in cancer biology and treatment. This manuscript explores the sources and mechanisms of sPD-L1 production, its role in immune evasion and tumor progression, and its clinical significance. Elevated sPD-L1 levels have been linked to disease severity, survival, and treatment response in various malignancies, and as a consequence, strategies for combinatorial targeting of sPD-L1 with other immunotherapies are considered.

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Bladder cancer (BLCA), intimately associated with the immune system, represents a substantial global health burden due to its high recurrence rates and limited therapeutic effectiveness. Although immunotherapy shows promise, challenges persist due to the lack of reliable therapeutic targets. This study aims to investigate potential immune-related biomarkers that could influence the tumor microenvironment in BLCA, using proteomic and in silico approaches. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Tissue samples from BLCA patients (n = 27) and controls (n = 27) were collected from Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital. Proteomic analysis was performed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS to reveal the identities of differentially regulated proteins. Protein network analysis and hub protein detection were performed using Cytoscape (v.3.10.3), while functional annotation was carried out using EnrichR. The immunological analysis of hub proteins was performed in Sangerbox platform, and prognostic associations were evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier Plotter tool. <i>Results</i>: LC-MS/MS analysis identified 120 differentially regulated immune-related proteins. STRING analysis, using an immune response dataset (GO:0006955), highlighted the complement cascade as a significantly enriched pathway (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Proteins, namely C4A, CFB, C4B, C8B, CFH, CFI, C5, C4BPA, C3, and C2, that are known to play key roles in the complement system were identified. Immunological analysis with these proteins revealed the phenomena of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint gene associations (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Four hub genes-CFB, C4B, CFI, and C2-demonstrated a significant prognostic value for BLCA (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <i>Conclusions</i>: This study highlights the pivotal role of the complement system in the immune regulation of BLCA.

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Stereotactic radiotherapy enhances local tumor control by delivering high doses directly to the tumor. It is thought to activate the immune system via T-cells, possibly creating a systemic response. This study aims to evaluate stereotactic body radiotherapy's (SBRT) impact on the immune system by measuring T-cell transcription factors, such as TBX21, GATA-3, FoxP3, and RORɣt. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 103 patients before SBRT and from 66 patients two months post-treatment. We measured transcription factors TBX21, GATA-3, FOXP3, and RORγt using ELISA, and performed a complete blood count and C-reactive protein analysis to rule out infections. Statistical analyses included paired <i>t</i>-tests and correlation analyses to assess changes before and after treatment. <i>Results</i>: Post-treatment, significant reductions were observed in TBX21 (Th1), GATA-3 (Th2), and FOXP3 (Treg), while RORɣt (Th17) remained stable but trended higher in lung cancer patients. No correlations were found with demographic factors. However, TBX21 levels were significantly related to the planning target volume (PTV) and biologically effective dose (BED10) in the lung region. Larger PTVs (≥16.5 cc) and higher BED10 doses (≥100 Gy) were linked to smaller reductions in TBX21 (<i>p</i> = 0.008, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and increased RORɣt levels (<i>p</i> = 0.01). <i>Conclusions</i>: Stereotactic radiotherapy reduces immunosuppressive markers like FOXP3 and GATA-3, indicating its potential to boost immune activation by suppressing Treg and Th2 cells. Larger target volumes and higher BED10 values may enhance Th1 responses through TBX21. These findings suggest that SBRT activates the immune system, and its combination with immunotherapy could be promising.",Immunotherapy,ibackground objectivesi stereotactic radiotherapy enhances local tumor control delivering high doses directly tumor thought activate immune system via tcells possibly creating systemic response study aims evaluate stereotactic body radiotherapys sbrt impact immune system measuring tcell transcription factors tbx gata foxp rort imaterials methodsi peripheral blood samples collected patients sbrt patients two months posttreatment measured transcription factors tbx gata foxp rort using elisa performed complete blood count creactive protein analysis rule infections statistical analyses included paired ititests correlation analyses assess changes treatment iresultsi posttreatment significant reductions observed tbx th gata th foxp treg rort th remained stable trended higher lung cancer patients correlations found demographic factors however tbx levels significantly related planning target volume ptv biologically effective dose bed lung region larger ptvs cc higher bed doses gy linked smaller reductions tbx ipi ipi increased rort levels ipi iconclusionsi stereotactic radiotherapy reduces immunosuppressive markers like foxp gata indicating potential boost immune activation suppressing treg th cells larger target volumes higher bed values may enhance th responses tbx findings suggest sbrt activates immune system combination immunotherapy could promising,Immunotherapy
"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health challenge with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the association between Klintrup-Mäkinen (KM) inflammatory infiltrate grading and clinicopathological features in gastric cancer patients, investigating its potential as a prognostic marker. <i>Material and Methods:</i> This retrospective study analyzed 133 gastric adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed between 2020 and 2021 at County Clinical Hospital in Târgu Mureș, Romania. Patients were divided into two groups based on KM grades: low (grades 0-1, <i>n</i> = 62) and high (grades 2-3, <i>n</i> = 71). Clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between the groups. <i>Results:</i> Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups. Patients with low KM grades demonstrated significantly more aggressive tumor features, including a higher prevalence of Borrmann classification types III-IV (75.8% vs. 54.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.01), poorly differentiated histology (74.1% vs. 33.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), advanced T stage (93.5% vs. 80.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and lymph node involvement (87% vs. 60.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.0008). This group also exhibited higher rates of lymphatic invasion (79% vs. 50.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.001), venous invasion (51.6% vs. 30.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.02), perineural invasion (50% vs. 22.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and positive surgical margins (32.2% vs. 15.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Survival analysis revealed a hazard ratio of 1.642 (95% CI: 1.02-2.62) for patients with low KM grades compared to those with high KM grades. <i>Conclusions:</i> Low KM grades are associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics and poorer prognosis in GC patients. The KM score may serve as a valuable, cost-effective histological marker for assessing tumor aggressiveness and could aid in risk stratification when applied to routine H&E-stained slides. While it does not replace immunohistochemical or molecular analyses, integrating the KM score into pathological assessment may enhance prognostic accuracy and support identifying patients who might benefit from immunotherapy.",Immunotherapy,ibackground objectivesi gastric cancer gc remains significant global health challenge poor prognosis study aimed evaluate association klintrupmkinen km inflammatory infiltrate grading clinicopathological features gastric cancer patients investigating potential prognostic marker imaterial methodsi retrospective study analyzed gastric adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed county clinical hospital trgu mure romania patients divided two groups based km grades low grades ini high grades ini clinicopathological characteristics survival outcomes compared groups iresultsi demographic characteristics similar groups patients low km grades demonstrated significantly aggressive tumor features including higher prevalence borrmann classification types iiiiv vs ipi poorly differentiated histology vs ipi advanced stage vs ipi lymph node involvement vs ipi group also exhibited higher rates lymphatic invasion vs ipi venous invasion vs ipi perineural invasion vs ipi positive surgical margins vs ipi survival analysis revealed hazard ratio ci patients low km grades compared high km grades iconclusionsi low km grades associated aggressive tumor characteristics poorer prognosis gc patients km score may serve valuable costeffective histological marker assessing tumor aggressiveness could aid risk stratification applied routine hestained slides replace immunohistochemical molecular analyses integrating km score pathological assessment may enhance prognostic accuracy support identifying patients might benefit immunotherapy,Immunotherapy
"Neoplastic disorders, particularly malignant carcinomas, are complex systemic diseases characterized by unregulated cellular proliferation, the invasion of adjacent tissues, and potential metastasis to distant bodily sites. Among the diverse spectrum of cancer subtypes, malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive form of cutaneous cancer originating in melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells resident in the skin. This malignancy is distinguished by its rapid and uncontrolled growth, as well as its propensity for metastasis to vital organs, thereby posing significant challenges to therapeutic intervention and prognostication. Early detection of melanoma is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes, as diagnosis at an advanced stage often yields a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Diagnostic modalities for melanoma encompass comprehensive clinical evaluations by dermatologists; radiological imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans; and excisional biopsies for accurate histopathological assessment. Malignant melanoma is typically treated with surgery to remove the tumor, followed by immunotherapy to enhance the immune response, targeted therapy for tumors with specific genetic mutations, chemotherapy for advanced stages, radiation therapy to manage metastasis, and other adjunct therapies. This review presents the properties and possible adjunct therapeutic effects against malignant melanoma of quercetin found in the literature and explores, based on the observed physicochemical properties and biological activity, its potential development as a topical formulation for cutaneous application. Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound abundant in various plant-based food sources, including apples, onions, berries, and citrus fruits, and has exhibited promising antiproliferative, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Its distinctive biochemical structure enables quercetin to effectively neutralize reactive oxygen species and modulate key carcinogenic pathways, thereby rendering it a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention in managing malignant tumors, including melanoma.",Immunotherapy,neoplastic disorders particularly malignant carcinomas complex systemic diseases characterized unregulated cellular proliferation invasion adjacent tissues potential metastasis distant bodily sites among diverse spectrum cancer subtypes malignant melanoma highly aggressive form cutaneous cancer originating melanocytes pigmentproducing cells resident skin malignancy distinguished rapid uncontrolled growth well propensity metastasis vital organs thereby posing significant challenges therapeutic intervention prognostication early detection melanoma crucial optimizing patient outcomes diagnosis advanced stage often yields poor prognosis limited treatment options diagnostic modalities melanoma encompass comprehensive clinical evaluations dermatologists radiological imaging techniques ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging mri computed tomography ct scans excisional biopsies accurate histopathological assessment malignant melanoma typically treated surgery remove tumor followed immunotherapy enhance immune response targeted therapy tumors specific genetic mutations chemotherapy advanced stages radiation therapy manage metastasis adjunct therapies review presents properties possible adjunct therapeutic effects malignant melanoma quercetin found literature explores based observed physicochemical properties biological activity potential development topical formulation cutaneous application quercetin naturally occurring flavonoid compound abundant various plantbased food sources including apples onions berries citrus fruits exhibited promising antiproliferative antioxidant anticancer properties distinctive biochemical structure enables quercetin effectively neutralize reactive oxygen species modulate key carcinogenic pathways thereby rendering potential candidate therapeutic intervention managing malignant tumors including melanoma,Immunotherapy
"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy across different treatment lines in patients with pleural mesothelioma. It also sought to identify factors influencing the success of immunotherapy, such as histological subtype, PD-L1 expression, type of asbestos exposure, and metastatic status. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A retrospective analysis was conducted with 60 patients diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma. Data on age, gender, histological subtype, and asbestos exposure were collected for all patients and PD-L1 expression was assessed in a subset of patients. Patients received either chemotherapy or immunotherapy as first-, second-, and third-line treatments, and progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment responses were evaluated. <i>Results:</i> Among the 60 patients, 35 (58.3%) were male and the median age was 59 years. The majority (71.7%) had epithelioid histology and 28.3% had distant metastases. Asbestos exposure was documented in 65% of the cases. PD-L1 expression of ≥1% was found in 13 of 17 patients tested. First-line treatments included immunotherapy for 11 patients and chemotherapy for the others, with immunotherapy achieving median PFS of 9 months versus 6 months for chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. In third-line treatments, immunotherapy significantly outperformed chemotherapy with median PFS of 6 months compared to 3 months (<i>p</i> = 0.048). Absence of metastasis and prior asbestos exposure in an endemic region were linked to better immunotherapy outcomes. <i>Conclusion:</i> Immunotherapy shows increased efficacy in later treatment lines for pleural mesothelioma, especially for patients without metastases or with prior endemic asbestos exposure.

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The administration of oral vaccines offers a potential strategy for cancer immunotherapy; yet, the development of effective platforms continues to pose a difficulty. This study examines <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) as a microbial vector for the precise delivery of Glypican-1 (GPC1), a tumor-associated antigen significantly overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).To evaluate the effectiveness of EcN as a vector for the delivery of GPC1 and assess its potential as an oral vaccination platform for cancer immunotherapy. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: EcN was genetically modified to produce a GPC1-flagellin fusion protein (GPC1-FL) to augment antigen immunogenicity. The expression and stability of GPC1 were confirmed in modified PANC02 cells using Western blot and flow cytometry, indicating that GPC1 expression did not influence tumor cell growth. A mouse model was employed to test immunogenicity post-oral delivery, measuring systemic IgG, IL-10, IL-2, and IFN-γ levels to indicate immune activation. <i>Results</i>: Oral immunization with EcN GPC1-FL elicited a robust systemic immune response, demonstrated by markedly increased levels of IgG and IL-10. IL-2 and IFN-γ concentrations were elevated in vaccinated mice relative to controls; however, the differences lacked statistical significance. Western blot examination of fecal samples verified consistent antigen expression in the gastrointestinal tract, indicating effective bacterial colonization and antigen retention. No detrimental impacts were noted, hence substantiating the safety of this methodology. <i>Conclusions</i>: These findings confirm EcN as a feasible and patient-friendly oral vaccination platform for cancer immunotherapy. The effective production of GPC1 in tumor cells, along with continuous antigen delivery and immune activation, underscores the promise of this approach for PDAC and other cancers.

"Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) is the most severe radiological/histological pattern of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). It is typical of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), but is also frequently described in Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (ARDs), sharing with IPF common risk factors, genetic backgrounds, and in some cases, disease progression and prognosis. Following the results of the PANTHER study, immunosuppressive drugs are now not recommended for the treatment of IPF; however, their use for the treatment of UIP secondary to ARDs is still under debate. The aim of this review is to summarize existing knowledge on the clinical presentation of autoimmune UIP and its treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. We searched PubMed for English language clinical trials and studies on treatment of ARDs-ILD, looking for specific treatments of UIP-ARDs. The available clinical trials rarely stratify patients by ILD pattern, and clinical studies generally lack a comparison with a placebo group. In Systemic Sclerosis, UIP patients showed a non-significant trend of worsening under immunosuppression. On the contrary, in Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features and, above all, Rheumatoid Arthritis, immunosuppressive treatment produced promising results in the management of UIP patients. In conclusion, the current evidence about the immunosuppressive treatment of UIP-ARDs is limited and conflicting. There is an urgent need to adequately assess this topic with specific clinical trials, as has already been performed for IPF. The possibility should be considered that different ARDs can respond differently to immunosuppression. Finally, a wider use of histological samples could produce valuable information from a diagnostic, therapeutic, and research point of view.",Immunotherapy,usual interstitial pneumonia uip severe radiologicalhistological pattern interstitial lung disease ild typical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf also frequently described autoimmune rheumatic diseases ards sharing ipf common risk factors genetic backgrounds cases disease progression prognosis following results panther study immunosuppressive drugs recommended treatment ipf however use treatment uip secondary ards still debate aim review summarize existing knowledge clinical presentation autoimmune uip treatment immunosuppressive drugs searched pubmed english language clinical trials studies treatment ardsild looking specific treatments uipards available clinical trials rarely stratify patients ild pattern clinical studies generally lack comparison placebo group systemic sclerosis uip patients showed nonsignificant trend worsening immunosuppression contrary interstitial pneumonia autoimmune features rheumatoid arthritis immunosuppressive treatment produced promising results management uip patients conclusion current evidence immunosuppressive treatment uipards limited conflicting urgent need adequately assess topic specific clinical trials already performed ipf possibility considered different ards respond differently immunosuppression finally wider use histological samples could produce valuable information diagnostic therapeutic research point view,Immunotherapy
"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Animal models are widely used in medical research, but most are limited to small or medium-sized species due to logistical constraints. However, pancreatic cancer research and surgical xenograft models require large animals with anatomical similarities to humans and minimal immune rejection. This study evaluates the feasibility of an operative immunodeficient pig model for patient-derived xenografts. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: During the period of October 2020 and October 2021, four pigs were used to establish a pig model at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. A conventional pig 40 weeks of age was used. After introduction into the animal laboratory, splenectomy and thymectomy were performed to minimize B-cell and T-cell function. One week after the initial operation, oral immunosuppression was administered. After 4 weeks, human PDAC cells were implanted in the liver and pancreas. After 4 weeks of implant, the pigs were sacrificed, and the operative and pathologic findings were analyzed. <i>Results</i>: All four pigs survived the 9-week experiment. Indwelling venous catheters for drug-level monitoring were attempted but failed. Splenectomy and thymectomy were deemed to be feasible and effective. Oral immunosuppression was acceptable, but the initial dosage was better tolerated at low levels. Out of the four pigs, one pig showed a mass formation at the cell line injection site, demonstrating reactive cell clusters on pathology. <i>Conclusions</i>: This pig model using conventional pigs is a feasible model of immunosuppression.

"Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a promising approach for treating food allergy. Here, we elucidated the mechanisms of desensitization induced by OIT in rats sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA). The desensitization was induced by ingestion of OVA three times per week after sensitization in rats. OIT suppressed the decrease in rectal temperature and increase in plasma histamine levels induced by OVA injection immediately and 4 weeks after OIT completion. Plasma OVA-specific IgE (sIgE) levels did not differ between the non-OIT and OIT groups, but OVA-specific IgG<sub>1</sub> levels were higher in the OIT group than in the non-OIT group at both timepoints. To evaluate IgG's effect on IgE crosslinking with OVA, amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay involving crosslinking (AlphaCL) was performed. When IgG was removed using a Protein G column, the AlphaCL signal was significantly increased, especially in the OIT group, indicating that OIT-induced IgG inhibited the sIgE response. The proportions of cluster of differentiation (CD)4<sup>+</sup> cells and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen were similar between the two groups. These findings indicate that OIT attenuates systemic allergic responses by inhibiting sIgE binding to OVA through increased IgG.

"Cancer is biologically diverse, highly heterogeneous, and associated with molecular alterations, significantly contributing to mortality worldwide. Currently, cancer patients are subjected to single or combination treatments comprising chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. Chemotherapy remains the first line of treatment in cancer but faces a major obstacle in the form of chemoresistance. This obstacle has resulted in relapses and poor patient survival due to decreased treatment efficacy. Aberrant pre-mRNA alternative splicing can significantly modulate gene expression and function involved in the resistance mechanisms, potentially shaping the intricate landscape of tumour chemoresistance. Thus, novel strategies targeting abnormal pre-mRNA alternative splicing and understanding the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance could aid in overcoming the chemotherapeutic challenges. This review first highlights drug targets, drug pumps, detoxification mechanisms, DNA damage response, and evasion of apoptosis and cell death as key molecular mechanisms involved in chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, the review discusses the progress of research on the dysregulation of alternative splicing and molecular targets involved in chemotherapy resistance in major cancer types.",Immunotherapy,cancer biologically diverse highly heterogeneous associated molecular alterations significantly contributing mortality worldwide currently cancer patients subjected single combination treatments comprising chemotherapy surgery immunotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy chemotherapy remains first line treatment cancer faces major obstacle form chemoresistance obstacle resulted relapses poor patient survival due decreased treatment efficacy aberrant premrna alternative splicing significantly modulate gene expression function involved resistance mechanisms potentially shaping intricate landscape tumour chemoresistance thus novel strategies targeting abnormal premrna alternative splicing understanding molecular mechanisms chemotherapy resistance could aid overcoming chemotherapeutic challenges review first highlights drug targets drug pumps detoxification mechanisms dna damage response evasion apoptosis cell death key molecular mechanisms involved chemotherapy resistance furthermore review discusses progress research dysregulation alternative splicing molecular targets involved chemotherapy resistance major cancer types,Immunotherapy
"To study whether shorter restaging intervals are associated with lower hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (PFS), as suggested in breast cancer. Studies supporting the registration of oncologic drugs in Switzerland from 2010 to 2022 were analyzed. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PFS were pooled in a meta-analysis using the generic inverse-variance method and a random-effects model in RevMan v5.4. The HRs were stratified by restaging intervals (<median vs. ≥median), both overall and within prespecified subgroups. A total of 112 studies comprising 69,579 patients were included. The median restaging interval was 8 weeks, with a range of 4 to 18 weeks. Longer restaging intervals (≥8 weeks) were associated with lower HRs compared to shorter intervals (<8 weeks), with pooled HRs of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.44-0.52) and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.53-0.63), respectively. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.005), with a substantial heterogeneity (Cochran's Q <i>p</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 90%). Subgroup analyses based on treatment type, including immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, did not show any statistically significant differences in HRs.

"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a highly heterogeneous tumor and the most prevalent pathological type of lung cancer. The alternative splicing (AS) of mRNA enables the generation of multiple protein products from a single gene. This is a tightly regulated process that significantly contributes to the proteome diversity in eukaryotes. Recent multi-omics studies have delineated the splicing profiles that underline LUAD tumorigenesis from initiation to metastasis. Such progress holds robust promise to facilitate the development of screening strategies and individualized therapies. Perturbed AS fosters the emergence of novel neoantigen resources and disturbances in the immune microenvironment, which allow new investigations into modulatory targets for LUAD immunotherapy. This review presents an update on the landscape of dysregulated splicing events in LUAD and the associated mechanisms and theranostic perspectives with unique insights into AS-based immunotherapy, such as Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell therapy.

"Breast cancer is the most common and deadly female-specific malignancy in the world. Four immunohistochemical subtypes are distinguished: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triple-negative. In turn, the HER2-positive subtype presents two variants depending on the status of the hormone receptors. The variant that expresses them can benefit from both anti-HER2 and anti-hormonal therapy. Today, MCTP finds application in maintenance therapy after standard of care and in advanced breast cancer when the patient's clinical condition is already seriously compromised by metastatic disease; in this context, it is used as a first-line treatment, in pre-treated subjects, or as a rescue treatment. Here, the use of adjuvant oral MCTP after surgery at an early stage in HER-2 and hormone-positive local breast cancer is proposed, where effective treatment options are available, such as anti-HER2 therapy (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab), anti-hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, letrozole), radiotherapy, and, in case of strong PD-1 positivity, immunotherapy.",Immunotherapy,breast cancer common deadly femalespecific malignancy world four immunohistochemical subtypes distinguished luminal luminal b herpositive triplenegative turn herpositive subtype presents two variants depending status hormone receptors variant expresses benefit antiher antihormonal therapy today mctp finds application maintenance therapy standard care advanced breast cancer patients clinical condition already seriously compromised metastatic disease context used firstline treatment pretreated subjects rescue treatment use adjuvant oral mctp surgery early stage hormonepositive local breast cancer proposed effective treatment options available antiher therapy eg trastuzumab pertuzumab antihormonal therapy eg tamoxifen letrozole radiotherapy case strong pd positivity immunotherapy,Immunotherapy
"Upper gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, including esophageal, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), and gastric adenocarcinomas, remain a major global health concern, with poor overall survival and high recurrence rate despite aggressive treatment. Patients with very early tumors (cT1a) can benefit from endoscopic therapy. However, patients with locally advanced disease require multimodal therapies that may combine surgery, radiation, and systemic therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the treatment of locally advanced upper GI adenocarcinomas. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of curative treatment, with perioperative chemotherapy emerging as the standard of care. While preoperative chemoradiation has demonstrated some benefits in esophageal and GEJ cancers, recent data suggest a more limited role for radiation going forward. Immunotherapy has shown some promise in both the adjuvant and perioperative settings but has yet to establish definitive survival benefit. The integration of HER2-targeted therapies into treatment regimens for HER2-positive locally advanced gastroesophageal cancers has not yielded significant improvements, underscoring the need for more effective strategies.

"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related lower genital cancers, including cervical cancer, anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, and penile cancer, pose a significant health burden, with approximately 45,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Current effective treatment modalities include chemoradiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The tumor microenvironment in HPV-related cancers is characterized by immune evasion mechanisms, including the modulation of immune checkpoints such as PD-L1/PD-1. HPV oncoproteins E5, E6, and E7 play crucial roles in this process, altering the expression of immune inhibitory molecules and the recruitment of immune cells. ICIs, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, have shown efficacy in enhancing the immune response against HPV-associated tumors by blocking proteins that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Recent studies have demonstrated that HPV-positive tumors exhibit a more favorable response to ICI-based therapies compared to HPV-negative tumors. The integration of ICIs into treatment regimens for HPV-related cancers has been supported by several clinical trials. The inclusion of ICIs in the treatment approach for HPV-related lower genital cancers presents a promising opportunity for improving patient outcomes.

"<b>Background:</b> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and highly lethal form of liver cancer, with limited effective treatment options, particularly in the advanced stages. Immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has emerged as a promising treatment modality, yet a substantial proportion of patients exhibit resistance or fail to respond to such therapies. This study aimed to elucidate the role of G0/G1 Switch 2 (G0S2) in regulating PD-L1 expression in monocytes within the HCC tumor microenvironment and to investigate its impact on the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. <b>Methods:</b> Gene expression data among HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were obtained from the HCC single-cell sequencing database; immunohistochemistry was performed to detect G0S2 expression in liver cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues of HCC patients; flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the expression of G0S2, PD-L1, CD206, and CD14 in PBMCs from HCC patients; and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion were used to evaluate the impact of G0S2 knockdown. <b>Results:</b> Utilizing single-cell sequencing data from HCC patients, we identified that G0S2 expression was significantly elevated in the non-responders (NR) compared to responders (R) to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels of G0S2 in HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues, while the flow cytometry revealed the increased expression of G0S2, PD-L1, and CD206 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from NR patients compared to R patients and healthy controls. The functional experiments involving the knockdown of G0S2 in the THP-1 monocyte cell line resulted in a significant reduction in PD-L1 expression and a concomitant increase in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings indicate that G0S2 facilitates the upregulation of PD-L1 in monocytes, thereby suppressing T cell activity and contributing to resistance against PD-1 inhibitors in HCC. The high expression of G0S2 in peripheral blood monocytes offers a non-invasive and easily detectable biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Consequently, targeting G0S2 may enhance the responsiveness to immunotherapy in HCC patients, providing a new avenue for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",Immunotherapy,bbackgroundb hepatocellular carcinoma hcc prevalent highly lethal form liver cancer limited effective treatment options particularly advanced stages immunotherapy using pd inhibitors emerged promising treatment modality yet substantial proportion patients exhibit resistance fail respond therapies study aimed elucidate role gg switch gs regulating pdl expression monocytes within hcc tumor microenvironment investigate impact efficacy pd inhibitors bmethodsb gene expression data among hcc patients treated pd inhibitors obtained hcc singlecell sequencing database immunohistochemistry performed detect gs expression liver cancer tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues hcc patients flow cytometry utilized analyze expression gs pdl cd cd pbmcs hcc patients cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn secretion used evaluate impact gs knockdown bresultsb utilizing singlecell sequencing data hcc patients identified gs expression significantly elevated nonresponders nr compared responders r pd inhibitor therapy immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels gs hcc tumor tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues flow cytometry revealed increased expression gs pdl cd peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs nr patients compared r patients healthy controls functional experiments involving knockdown gs thp monocyte cell line resulted significant reduction pdl expression concomitant increase cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn production bconclusionsb findings indicate gs facilitates upregulation pdl monocytes thereby suppressing cell activity contributing resistance pd inhibitors hcc high expression gs peripheral blood monocytes offers noninvasive easily detectable biomarker predicting efficacy pd inhibitor therapy consequently targeting gs may enhance responsiveness immunotherapy hcc patients providing new avenue optimizing treatment strategies improving patient outcomes,Immunotherapy

Advances in precision medicine, particularly proteomics, are reshaping care by tailoring treatments to individual patient characteristics. For CeD, therapies like gluten-degrading enzymes (latiglutenase, Kuma030) and zonulin inhibitors (larazotide acetate) show promise, though clinical outcomes are inconsistent. Immunotherapy and microbiota modulation, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are also under exploration, with potential benefits in symptom management. Transglutaminase 2 inhibitors like ZED-1227 could help prevent gluten-induced damage. Monoclonal antibodies targeting immune pathways, such as AMG 714 and larazotide acetate, require further validation in pediatric populations. In EoE, biologics like dupilumab, cendakimab, dectrekumab (IL-13 inhibitors), and mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab (IL-5/IL-5R inhibitors) show varying efficacy, while thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) inhibitors like tezepelumab are also being investigated. These therapies require more pediatric-specific research to optimize their use. For IBD, biologics like vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and risankizumab, as well as small molecules like tofacitinib, etrasimod, and upadacitinib, are emerging treatments. New medications for individuals with refractory or steroid-dependent AIH have been explored. Personalized therapy, integrating precision medicine, therapeutic drug monitoring, and lifestyle changes, is increasingly guiding pediatric IBD management. This narrative review explores recent breakthroughs in treating CeD, EoE, IBD, and AIH, with a focus on pediatric studies when available, and discusses the growing role of proteomics in advancing personalized gastroenterological care.",Immunotherapy,pediatric gastroenterology entering pivotal phase marked significant challenges emerging opportunities treating conditions like celiac disease ced eosinophilic esophagitis eoe inflammatory bowel disease ibd autoimmune hepatitis aih pose significant clinical hurdles new therapeutic avenues emerging advances precision medicine particularly proteomics reshaping care tailoring treatments individual patient characteristics ced therapies like glutendegrading enzymes latiglutenase kuma zonulin inhibitors larazotide acetate show promise though clinical outcomes inconsistent immunotherapy microbiota modulation including probiotics fecal microbiota transplantation fmt also exploration potential benefits symptom management transglutaminase inhibitors like zed could help prevent gluteninduced damage monoclonal antibodies targeting immune pathways amg larazotide acetate require validation pediatric populations eoe biologics like dupilumab cendakimab dectrekumab il inhibitors mepolizumab reslizumab benralizumab ililr inhibitors show varying efficacy thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp inhibitors like tezepelumab also investigated therapies require pediatricspecific research optimize use ibd biologics like vedolizumab ustekinumab risankizumab well small molecules like tofacitinib etrasimod upadacitinib emerging treatments new medications individuals refractory steroiddependent aih explored personalized therapy integrating precision medicine therapeutic drug monitoring lifestyle changes increasingly guiding pediatric ibd management narrative review explores recent breakthroughs treating ced eoe ibd aih focus pediatric studies available discusses growing role proteomics advancing personalized gastroenterological care,Immunotherapy
"Recent clinical trials have suggested that solid cancers with mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency are highly responsive to immunotherapy, regardless of cancer types. Previous MMR-related studies on breast cancer have predominantly focused on germline variants. However, the somatic MMR alterations have not been comprehensively characterized in breast cancer. In this study, we integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data from over 3000 breast cancer cases across six public cohorts. Our findings revealed that 1.2% of breast cancers harbored oncogenic somatic MMR alterations, with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) demonstrating the highest mutation rate at 3.1%. Additionally, somatic MMR alterations were significantly associated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and MMR-related mutational signatures, indicating that somatic MMR alterations led to impaired function of the MMR system. Biallelic inactivation of MMR genes resulted in a more pronounced loss of MMR function compared to monoallelic inactivation. Importantly, these MMR alterations significantly increased the tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen load in breast cancer, regardless of MSI-H status. These findings indicate that the frequency of MMR alterations is highest in TNBC and that MMR alterations in breast cancer can lead to MMR functional deficiencies, suggesting that some patients harboring such alterations may benefit from immunotherapy.",Immunotherapy,recent clinical trials suggested solid cancers mismatch repair mmr deficiency highly responsive immunotherapy regardless cancer types previous mmrrelated studies breast cancer predominantly focused germline variants however somatic mmr alterations comprehensively characterized breast cancer study integrated genomic transcriptomic clinical data breast cancer cases across six public cohorts findings revealed breast cancers harbored oncogenic somatic mmr alterations triplenegative breast cancer tnbc demonstrating highest mutation rate additionally somatic mmr alterations significantly associated microsatellite instabilityhigh msih mmrrelated mutational signatures indicating somatic mmr alterations led impaired function mmr system biallelic inactivation mmr genes resulted pronounced loss mmr function compared monoallelic inactivation importantly mmr alterations significantly increased tumor mutational burden tmb neoantigen load breast cancer regardless msih status findings indicate frequency mmr alterations highest tnbc mmr alterations breast cancer lead mmr functional deficiencies suggesting patients harboring alterations may benefit immunotherapy,Immunotherapy
"Cancer treatment has historically depended on conventional methods like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery; however, these strategies frequently present considerable limitations, including toxicity, resistance, and negative impacts on healthy tissues. In addressing these challenges, drug-free cancer therapies have developed as viable alternatives, utilizing advanced physical and biological methods to specifically target tumor cells while reducing damage to normal tissues. This review examines several drug-free cancer treatment strategies, such as high-intensity focused energy beams, nanosecond pulsed electric fields, and photothermal therapy as well as the use of inorganic nanoparticles to promote selective apoptosis. We also investigate the significance of targeting the tumor microenvironment, precision medicine, and immunotherapy in the progression of personalized cancer therapies. Although these approaches demonstrate significant promise, challenges including scalability, safety, and regulatory obstacles must be resolved for clinical application.

"Annual flu vaccination is recommended for children with rheumatic diseases. We investigated the cellular and humoral immune response and safety in pediatric patients that received inactivated influenza vaccines. This is a comparative study of in 41 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) receiving influenza vaccination while being treated with methotrexate (MTX) or biological therapy. The influenza vaccination was administered as a single dose of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). Serological tests to monitor seroconversion and seroprotection were performed at baseline and at 4 as well as 12 weeks after vaccination. In all of the 41 children with JIA and the 22 healthy children seroconversion and seroprotection were observed for Influenza A. For Influenza B, no adequate seroconversion rates were not detected in any of the groups studied. No significant differences were observed in lymphocyte subpopulations when analysing time points and groups simultaneously. There were no relapses or cases of influenza infection after the vaccination. Our findings do not suggest non-specific immune activation following vaccination based on the distribution and quantity of the lymphocyte subsets that were investigated. The present study demonstrates adequate seroprotection rates against influenza A in immunosuppressed children with JIA.

"Clinical trials have shown that neoadjuvant anlotinib combined with PD-1 blockade therapy can prolong the survival of patients with driver gene negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but some patients fail to benefit from the combination therapy. To explore the potential drug resistance mechanism and predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in NSCLC patients, we used scRNA-seq to observe and analyze the dynamic changes of immune cells, stromal cells and cancer cells in NSCLC patients who received neoadjuvant combination therapy. We analyzed transcriptome data of ~ 47,000 single cells from 9 NSCLC patients, including 3 treatment naïve patients, 3 post-treatment patients with major pathological response (MPR), and 3 Non-MPR patients. Subsequently, the infiltration of immune cells was detected by immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence in NSCLC. In MPR patients, we found that neoadjuvant therapy reduced the expression of the T cell exhausted signature, reduced the transition of T_THEMIS cells to Tregs, and enhanced the positive feedback between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and PAX5<sup>+</sup> memory B cells. In Non-MPR patients, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dampen therapeutic efficiency by being the hub of cell communication. TAMs and fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via VEGF, endothelial ZEB1 may up-regulate FLT1 (VEGFR) expression in response to anlotinib, and VEGFR<sup>+</sup> endothelial cell signature can predict survival of NSCLC cohort in TCGA. In addition, PLA2G4A, the key enzyme in the VEGF pathway, was highly expressed in the tumor cells of Non-MPR patients after anlotinib treatment. In 135 NSCLC patients, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that PLA2G4A was positively correlated with poor prognosis and Tregs infiltration. In conclusion, VEGF signaling dependent dynamic changes in endothelial and epithelial cells are deeply involved in the formation of anlotinib resistance and immunosuppression phenotypes in NSCLC patients.",Immunotherapy,clinical trials shown neoadjuvant anlotinib combined pd blockade therapy prolong survival patients driver gene negative nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc patients fail benefit combination therapy explore potential drug resistance mechanism predict efficacy neoadjuvant therapy nsclc patients used scrnaseq observe analyze dynamic changes immune cells stromal cells cancer cells nsclc patients received neoadjuvant combination therapy analyzed transcriptome data single cells nsclc patients including treatment nave patients posttreatment patients major pathological response mpr nonmpr patients subsequently infiltration immune cells detected immunohistochemistry multiplex immunofluorescence nsclc mpr patients found neoadjuvant therapy reduced expression cell exhausted signature reduced transition tthemis cells tregs enhanced positive feedback cdsupsup cells paxsupsup memory b cells nonmpr patients tumorassociated macrophages tams dampen therapeutic efficiency hub cell communication tams fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via vegf endothelial zeb may upregulate flt vegfr expression response anlotinib vegfrsupsup endothelial cell signature predict survival nsclc cohort tcga addition plaga key enzyme vegf pathway highly expressed tumor cells nonmpr patients anlotinib treatment nsclc patients confirmed immunohistochemistry plaga positively correlated poor prognosis tregs infiltration conclusion vegf signaling dependent dynamic changes endothelial epithelial cells deeply involved formation anlotinib resistance immunosuppression phenotypes nsclc patients,Immunotherapy
"This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts-such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia-is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules-such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT-are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression-through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation-the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.",Immunotherapy,review discusses reprogramming breast tumor immune microenvironment immunosuppressive cold state immunologically active hot state complex interplay revealed accumulation metabolic byproductssuch lactate reactive oxygen species ros ammoniais shown impair tcell function promote tumor immune escape demonstrated tumor microenvironment tme dominated immunosuppressive cytokines including interleukin il transforming growth factor tgf il notably il produced regulatory cells breast cancer cells conversion conventional cells ilproducing induced regulatory cells along inhibition proinflammatory cytokine secretion contributes suppression antitumor immunity demonstrated key immune checkpoint moleculessuch pd pdl ctla tim lag tigitare upregulated within tme leading tcell exhaustion diminished immune responses blockade checkpoints shown restore tcell functionality proposed strategy convert cold tumors hot ones robust effector cell infiltration therapeutic potential chimeric antigen receptor cart cell therapy also explored targeting specific tumorassociated antigens glycoproteins receptor tyrosine kinases highlighted suggested cart cell efficacy enhanced combining cells immune checkpoint inhibitors immunomodulatory agents thereby overcoming barriers imposed immunosuppressive tme moreover role microbiome regulating estrogen metabolism systemic inflammation reviewed alterations gut microbiota shown affect tme microbiomebased interventions proposed additional means facilitate coldtohot transition concluded targeting metabolic immunological pathways underpin immune suppressionthrough combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade cart cell therapies microbiome modulationthe conversion breast tme cold hot achieved reprogramming anticipated enhance immune cell infiltration function thereby improving overall efficacy immunotherapies leading better clinical outcomes breast cancer patients,Immunotherapy
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a ""cold"" immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored ""hot"" inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.",Immunotherapy,immune checkpoint inhibitors icis present clinical benefits many cancer patients invariably fail glioblastoma gbm common deadly primary brain tumor lack icis efficacy gbm attributed accumulation tumorreprogrammed gliomaassociated myeloid cells gams create cold immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment tme impeding infiltration activation effector cells gbmderived vvintegrin ligands including spp shown mediate emergence gams hypothesized combination strategy aiming block reprogramming gams using synthetic aargd peptide targets sppintegrin signaling might overcome resistance icis reinvigorate antitumor immunity matrigel invasion assay used test efficacy aargd gliomamicroglia cocultures determined impact aargd administered monotherapy combined pd blockade tumor growth gams accumulation phenotypes arginase levels neovasculature experimental gliomas effects treatments tumor immune landscape dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry immunocytochemistry cytokine profiling rnaseq analysis sorted gams followed citeseq based data deconvolution aargd efficiently blocked microgliadependent invasion human mouse glioma cells vitro intratumorally delivered aargd alone reduce tumor growth orthotopic gliomas prevented emergence immunosuppressive gams led normalization peritumoral blood vessels combining aargd antipd antibody resulted reduced tumor growth increase number proliferating interferon producing cdsupsupt cells depletion regulatory cells transcriptomic profiles myeloid cells altered combined treatment reflecting restored hot inflammatory tme boosted immunotherapy responses intratumoral administration aargd similarly modified phenotypes gams human umg gliomas immunocompromised mice exploration transcriptomic datasets revealed high expression integrin receptor coding genes pretreatment biopsies associated poorer response immune checkpoint blockade patients several types cancers demonstrate combining blockade sppintegrin signaling icis modifies innate immunity reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses paves way improve immunotherapy outcomes gbm,Immunotherapy
"In the Netherlands, a low COVID-19 vaccination uptake was reported among Moroccan immigrants. This population also faced a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, as well as severe morbidity and mortality, compared to native Dutch. We aimed to explore the COVID-19 vaccination decision-making process and the process from vaccination intention to uptake among Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands. Between April and June 2022, an exploratory qualitative study was performed among Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands (n = 29). Participants were recruited through community centres, mosques, and social media. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Seven themes were generated: (1) Attitudes shifted over time and the vaccination decision was postponed, (2) A personal multi-faceted risk-benefit assessment, rather than feelings of social responsibility, resulted in a decision to vaccinate or not, (3) Feelings of decisional or anticipated regret that accompanied the personal risk-benefit assessment influenced the vaccination decision, (4) Used information sources, (5) A perceived lack of trustworthiness of the information disclosed by the government and media had a direct or indirect negative influence on the decision-making process, (6) The social environment and its norms as support or burden in the decision-making process, and (7) Religious beliefs and values holding back and encouraging in the decision-making process. Many participants described the COVID-19 vaccination decision as a personal risk-benefit assessment, rather than a social responsibility. Many participants experienced lack of transparency of information from the government and the media, inhibiting them from making a good decision. We recommend providing clear and transparent information that explains possible contradictions and acknowledges uncertainties and potential adverse effects. Religious beliefs and values, and the strong influence of children and parents in making the vaccination decision should also be carefully considered in communication strategies.

"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients is associated with suboptimal antibody response (AbR) favouring breakthrough infection (BI). The role of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) remains uncertain. Single-center prospective longitudinal cohort study of adult SOT recipients monitored for both AbR and CMI at 6 ± 2 months after booster dosage of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Primary end-point was BI diagnosis and CMI was the main risk factor. Relationship between CMI and BI was investigated by bivariate tests and multivariable logistic regression. CMI was performed in 139 patients. In 66 patients BI was documented before CMI, thus 73 (33 kidney, 24 liver, 14 lung, 2 heart) were analysed. The first 2 vaccine doses consisted of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in 69.1% and 30.9% of cases, respectively. Whereas mRNA-1273 was used as for third dose in 91.2% of patients. At a median of 215 (IQR 181-252) days after booster dose, 40 (54.8%) patients displayed both AbR and CMI, 21 (28.8%) only AbR and 12 (16.4%) neither AbR or CMI; there were no patients showing negative AbR and positive CMI. Overall, 22 (30.1%) patients reported BI with no significant differences between those with positive vs. negative CMI (59.1% vs. 40.9%, p = 0.798), confirmed by multiple logistic regression after adjusting for age, type of vaccine and organs, high AbR and time from transplant.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major therapeutic challenge due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Pyroptosis is a form of cell death with complex dual functions in tumor immunity. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms and interactions between pyroptosis and immune evasion in HCC remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the role of ATP6AP1 in pyroptosis-mediated TME remodeling and its potential as a therapeutic target. We integrated large-scale datasets from TCGA and GEO databases to identify core modules by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), while mutation profiling and survival analysis verified clinical relevance. Multiple machine learning techniques, including GBM (gradient boosting machine), XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting machine), SVM (support vector machine), LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and random forest, as well as functional analysis, were used to systematically investigate the role of ATP6AP1 in HCC. Finally, CIBERSORT was used to analyze the immune infiltration pattern to gain insight into the mechanism. Through a rigorous multi-algorithm screening process, ATP6AP1 was found to be a highly reliable biomarker with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.979. We found that it has a recurrent C > T mutation with an incidence of 68%. Notably, its expression level was associated with stage (P < 0.001). We also found that regions with high ATP6AP1 expression were enriched in resting DCS (P < 0.05) and regulatory T cells (P < 0.05), which further promoted immunosuppressed TME. In our study, the machine learning-trained diagnostic model (AUC = 0.998) and the identified pyroptosis-related core gene ATP6AP1 provided an actionable strategy to overcome immune resistance in HCC. Mechanistically, ATP6AP1 stabilizes V-ATPase, which acidifies lysosomes, impairs antigen presentation, and drives pyroptotic inflammasome activation. This study highlights that ATP6AP1 plays a key role in promoting the lysosomal acidisis-pyroptosis-immunosuppression axis, and targeting ATP6AP1 can reshape the TME and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in HCC patients.",Immunotherapy,hepatocellular carcinoma hcc remains major therapeutic challenge due immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment tme resistance immune checkpoint inhibitors icis pyroptosis form cell death complex dual functions tumor immunity however precise regulatory mechanisms interactions pyroptosis immune evasion hcc remain poorly understood study aimed elucidate role atpap pyroptosismediated tme remodeling potential therapeutic target integrated largescale datasets tcga geo databases identify core modules weighted gene coexpression network analysis wgcna mutation profiling survival analysis verified clinical relevance multiple machine learning techniques including gbm gradient boosting machine xgboost extreme gradient boosting machine svm support vector machine lasso least absolute shrinkage selection operator random forest well functional analysis used systematically investigate role atpap hcc finally cibersort used analyze immune infiltration pattern gain insight mechanism rigorous multialgorithm screening process atpap found highly reliable biomarker area curve auc found recurrent c mutation incidence notably expression level associated stage p also found regions high atpap expression enriched resting dcs p regulatory cells p promoted immunosuppressed tme study machine learningtrained diagnostic model auc identified pyroptosisrelated core gene atpap provided actionable strategy overcome immune resistance hcc mechanistically atpap stabilizes vatpase acidifies lysosomes impairs antigen presentation drives pyroptotic inflammasome activation study highlights atpap plays key role promoting lysosomal acidisispyroptosisimmunosuppression axis targeting atpap reshape tme enhance efficacy immunotherapy hcc patients,Immunotherapy
"Tumor cells adapt to the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) and develop resistance to immunotherapy, with ferroptosis being a major form of tumor cell death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells coordinate TME stimuli and their unique metabolic traits to evade ferroptosis and develop resistance to immunotherapy remain unclear. Here we showed that interferon-γ (IFNγ)-activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylates phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) at serine 337 (S337), allowing it to interact with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and stabilize the protein, counteracting ferroptosis. PSAT1 elevates GPX4 stability by promoting α-ketoglutarate-dependent PHD3-mediated GPX4 proline 159 (P159) hydroxylation, disrupting its binding to HSC70 and inhibiting autophagy-mediated degradation. In mice, reconstitution of PSAT1 S337A or GPX4 P159A promotes ferroptosis and suppresses triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression. Blocking PSAT1 pS337 with CPP elevates IFNγ-induced ferroptosis and enhances the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies in TNBC. Additionally, PSAT1-mediated GPX4 hydroxylation correlates with poor immunotherapy outcomes in patients with TNBC, highlighting PSAT1's noncanonical role in suppressing ferroptosis and immunotherapy sensitivity.",Immunotherapy,tumor cells adapt inflammatory tumor microenvironment tme develop resistance immunotherapy ferroptosis major form tumor cell death however mechanisms tumor cells coordinate tme stimuli unique metabolic traits evade ferroptosis develop resistance immunotherapy remain unclear showed interferon ifnactivated calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase ii phosphorylates phosphoserine aminotransferase psat serine allowing interact glutathione peroxidase gpx stabilize protein counteracting ferroptosis psat elevates gpx stability promoting ketoglutaratedependent phdmediated gpx proline p hydroxylation disrupting binding hsc inhibiting autophagymediated degradation mice reconstitution psat sa gpx pa promotes ferroptosis suppresses triplenegative breast cancer tnbc progression blocking psat ps cpp elevates ifninduced ferroptosis enhances efficacy programmed cell death protein pd antibodies tnbc additionally psatmediated gpx hydroxylation correlates poor immunotherapy outcomes patients tnbc highlighting psats noncanonical role suppressing ferroptosis immunotherapy sensitivity,Immunotherapy

"The enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (EliSpot) assay and its fluorescence-based version, FluoroSpot, are sensitive immunoassays commonly used to quantify antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes and other immune cells in peripheral blood or homogenized tissues. Due to their high sensitivity, these assays are popular in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy and vaccines, which involve a high level of scrutiny to ensure valid study results. Besides industry consensus white papers and other research publications, there is no formal guidance for the industry on how to validate EliSpot and FluoroSpot assays to ensure their accurate performance for immune monitoring in clinical trials. Herein, we describe a comprehensive in vitro study using healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and model antigens to validate a double-color FluoroSpot assay for monitoring antigen-specific lymphocytes by detecting and quantifying IFN-γ and IL-2-producing lymphocytes. Validation parameters, acceptance criteria set-up, and assay limits-limit of detection (LOD), minimum positive control response, lower and upper limits of quantification (LLOQ and ULOQ)-were determined, and assay performance was demonstrated by assessing precision, specificity, linearity, and robustness. In addition, an inter-laboratory comparison demonstrated concordance between assay results from two laboratories. In summary, this study outlines a robust approach to EliSpot and FluoroSpot validation and demonstrates that the IFN-γ/IL-2 FluoroSpot assay is suitable for the reliable detection of antigen-specific immune responses from PBMC samples across laboratories and meets the current regulatory requirements for bioanalytical method validation.",Immunotherapy,enzymelinked immunosorbent spot elispot assay fluorescencebased version fluorospot sensitive immunoassays commonly used quantify antigenspecific b lymphocytes immune cells peripheral blood homogenized tissues due high sensitivity assays popular clinical trials evaluate efficacy immunotherapy vaccines involve high level scrutiny ensure valid study results besides industry consensus white papers research publications formal guidance industry validate elispot fluorospot assays ensure accurate performance immune monitoring clinical trials herein describe comprehensive vitro study using healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs model antigens validate doublecolor fluorospot assay monitoring antigenspecific lymphocytes detecting quantifying ifn ilproducing lymphocytes validation parameters acceptance criteria setup assay limitslimit detection lod minimum positive control response lower upper limits quantification lloq uloqwere determined assay performance demonstrated assessing precision specificity linearity robustness addition interlaboratory comparison demonstrated concordance assay results two laboratories summary study outlines robust approach elispot fluorospot validation demonstrates ifnil fluorospot assay suitable reliable detection antigenspecific immune responses pbmc samples across laboratories meets current regulatory requirements bioanalytical method validation,Immunotherapy
"Gastric cancer (GC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths and exhibits considerable heterogeneity among patients. Thus, accurate classifications are essential for predicting prognosis and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. To address this, we retrospectively analyzed multi-omics data from 359 GC samples, incorporating transcriptomic RNA (mRNA), DNA methylation, mutation data, and clinical parameters. Using ten clustering algorithms, we integrated these datasets to classify GC into molecular subtypes. The robustness of our clustering approach was externally validated using an independent cohort generated from different sequencing technologies, and we characterized the heterogeneity of each subtype. Our analysis identified three distinct molecular subtypes of GC, designated CS1, CS2, and CS3. These subtypes exhibited significant differences in survival outcomes, activation of cancer-related pathways, immune microenvironment composition, genomic alterations, and responses to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Notably, Cathepsin V (CTSV) was significantly downregulated in the immunologically active and highly responsive CS3 subtype, while it was upregulated in the immunologically exhausted CS2 subtype. These findings suggest that CTSV could serve as both a prognostic marker and a molecular classifier. Furthermore, this study provides the first evidence of CTSV's high expression in GC and its potential role in tumor progression. The novel clustering approach, based on ten clustering algorithms and comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data in gastric cancer, can guide prognosis, characterize different clinical and biological features, and elucidate the tumor immune microenvironment, providing insights into the intratumor heterogeneity of GC and potential novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, CTSV emerges as a prognostic marker linked to tumor immunity and disease progression, which lays the foundation for improved stratification strategies and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches in GC.",Immunotherapy,gastric cancer gc remains leading cause cancerrelated deaths exhibits considerable heterogeneity among patients thus accurate classifications essential predicting prognosis developing personalized therapeutic strategies address retrospectively analyzed multiomics data gc samples incorporating transcriptomic rna mrna dna methylation mutation data clinical parameters using ten clustering algorithms integrated datasets classify gc molecular subtypes robustness clustering approach externally validated using independent cohort generated different sequencing technologies characterized heterogeneity subtype analysis identified three distinct molecular subtypes gc designated cs cs cs subtypes exhibited significant differences survival outcomes activation cancerrelated pathways immune microenvironment composition genomic alterations responses immunotherapy chemotherapy notably cathepsin v ctsv significantly downregulated immunologically active highly responsive cs subtype upregulated immunologically exhausted cs subtype findings suggest ctsv could serve prognostic marker molecular classifier furthermore study provides first evidence ctsvs high expression gc potential role tumor progression novel clustering approach based ten clustering algorithms comprehensive analysis multiomics data gastric cancer guide prognosis characterize different clinical biological features elucidate tumor immune microenvironment providing insights intratumor heterogeneity gc potential novel therapeutic strategies additionally ctsv emerges prognostic marker linked tumor immunity disease progression lays foundation improved stratification strategies development targeted therapeutic approaches gc,Immunotherapy
"Intratumoral (IT) immunotherapy can stimulate the tumor microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immunity. We investigated IT delivery of three licensed viral vaccines-Shingrix (VZV shingles), Gardasil-9 (HPV), and Spikevax (SARS-CoV-2)-in prevaccinated mice using the murine tumor model TC-1, which expresses HPV16 oncogenes E6 and E7. Shingrix IT injection often induced tumor regression and resistance to secondary challenge. Injecting a VZV glycoprotein E (gE)-derived MHC-II-restricted peptide with polyI:C also led to durable remission, highlighting the role of gE-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. While Gardasil-9 IT injection alone was ineffective, combining a HPV L1-derived MHC-I-restricted peptide with polyI:C or Shingrix enhanced tumor regression. Both approaches elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells against the E7 tumor viral oncoprotein. Tumor microenvironment analysis revealed remodeling of the myeloid compartment, significant induction of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and CXCL9 and broad gene expression reprograming. In a dual-flank model, IT injection of Shingrix with an MHC-I-restricted E7 tumor-specific peptide eliminated primary and non-injected tumors. Finally, Spikevax IT injection showed modest tumor growth delay, while improved control was observed with a SARS-CoV-2 spike-derived MHC-I-restricted peptide and polyI:C. These results demonstrate the potential of licensed vaccines as promising platforms for IT immunotherapy, either alone or combined with vaccine- or tumor-derived MHC-I-restricted peptide epitopes.",Immunotherapy,intratumoral immunotherapy stimulate tumor microenvironment enhance antitumor immunity investigated delivery three licensed viral vaccinesshingrix vzv shingles gardasil hpv spikevax sarscovin prevaccinated mice using murine tumor model tc expresses hpv oncogenes e e shingrix injection often induced tumor regression resistance secondary challenge injecting vzv glycoprotein e gederived mhciirestricted peptide polyic also led durable remission highlighting role gespecific cdsupsup cells gardasil injection alone ineffective combining hpv lderived mhcirestricted peptide polyic shingrix enhanced tumor regression approaches elicited cdsupsup cells e tumor viral oncoprotein tumor microenvironment analysis revealed remodeling myeloid compartment significant induction ifn tnf cxcl broad gene expression reprograming dualflank model injection shingrix mhcirestricted e tumorspecific peptide eliminated primary noninjected tumors finally spikevax injection showed modest tumor growth delay improved control observed sarscov spikederived mhcirestricted peptide polyic results demonstrate potential licensed vaccines promising platforms immunotherapy either alone combined vaccine tumorderived mhcirestricted peptide epitopes,Immunotherapy
"Drug resistance is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of TIPE3 in drug resistance of CRC. TIPE3 expression in clinical samples and CRC cell lines was detected using qPCR. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were employed to analyze the proliferation of CRC cells. The apoptosis of CRC cells was analyzed using flow cytometry, and autophagy of CRC cells was detected using western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Moreover, the relationship between USP19 and Beclin1 was detected using co-immunoprecipitation. CRC cells that had been transfected with OE-TIPE3 were co-cultured with macrophages (THP-1 cells induced by PMA), to create a model of TIPE3 overexpression in macrophage M2 polarization. Additionally, a nude mouse tumor model was established. After chemotherapy, tumor apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL assay, and autophagy levels were measured using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. TIPE3 expression was increased in both CRC tumors and cell lines. TIPE3 overexpression substantially promoted drug resistance in CRC in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, TIPE3 upregulated USP19 protein expression, which accelerated autophagy. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation showed an interaction between USP19 and Beclin1. TIPE3 increased drug resistance by enhancing CRC cell autophagy via the USP19/Beclin1 pathway and stimulating macrophage polarization towards the M2-type. Thus, TIPE3 could serve as a potential target for the development of novel strategies to overcome chemoresistance.",Immunotherapy,drug resistance major obstacle effective treatment colorectal cancer crc however underlying mechanism remains unclear study investigated function mechanism tipe drug resistance crc tipe expression clinical samples crc cell lines detected using qpcr cck colony formation assays employed analyze proliferation crc cells apoptosis crc cells analyzed using flow cytometry autophagy crc cells detected using western blotting transmission electron microscopy immunofluorescence moreover relationship usp beclin detected using coimmunoprecipitation crc cells transfected oetipe cocultured macrophages thp cells induced pma create model tipe overexpression macrophage polarization additionally nude mouse tumor model established chemotherapy tumor apoptosis detected using tunel assay autophagy levels measured using immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry western blotting tipe expression increased crc tumors cell lines tipe overexpression substantially promoted drug resistance crc vivo vitro furthermore tipe upregulated usp protein expression accelerated autophagy addition coimmunoprecipitation showed interaction usp beclin tipe increased drug resistance enhancing crc cell autophagy via uspbeclin pathway stimulating macrophage polarization towards mtype thus tipe could serve potential target development novel strategies overcome chemoresistance,Immunotherapy
"Bone metastases affect approximately one-third of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and contribute to substantial skeletal complications and shorter survival. Management of these metastases requires a multidisciplinary approach combining systemic therapies, localized treatments, and supportive care. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combinations, especially doublets comprising an ICI and a VEGF-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have shown significant efficacy in mRCC with bone involvement. Bone-modifying agents such as zoledronic acid and denosumab help in mitigating symptomatic skeletal-related events and enhance bone integrity, although the unique bone pathology of RCC may limit their effectiveness. Local therapies, such as surgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy, play a pivotal role in providing symptom relief and controlling localized disease, particularly in oligometastatic cases. A personalized, patient-centered strategy is essential in minimizing systemic therapy disruptions, addressing skeletal morbidity, and improving clinical outcomes. PATIENT SUMMARY: Bone metastases in patients with kidney cancer can cause severe complications such as pain, fractures, and other serious issues, reducing quality of life and survival.

"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells predominantly located in barrier tissues such as the lung, liver, skin, and colon. These cells recognize metabolites derived from the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway, which can rapidly traverse epithelial barriers and be presented during MAIT cell differentiation in the thymus and maturation in peripheral tissues. Furthermore, microbial metabolites significantly influence MAIT cell functions in various conditions, including cancer. This review summarizes how the microbiota shapes the life trajectory of MAIT cells and their antitumor reactivity. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic implications of manipulating the microbiota as a 'bug-drug' strategy to enhance MAIT cell antitumor immunity, particularly in mucosal cancers, while emphasizing challenges and future directions for integrating microbiota considerations into MAIT cell-based therapies.",Immunotherapy,mucosalassociated invariant mait cells innatelike cells predominantly located barrier tissues lung liver skin colon cells recognize metabolites derived riboflavin biosynthetic pathway rapidly traverse epithelial barriers presented mait cell differentiation thymus maturation peripheral tissues furthermore microbial metabolites significantly influence mait cell functions various conditions including cancer review summarizes microbiota shapes life trajectory mait cells antitumor reactivity additionally discuss therapeutic implications manipulating microbiota bugdrug strategy enhance mait cell antitumor immunity particularly mucosal cancers emphasizing challenges future directions integrating microbiota considerations mait cellbased therapies,Immunotherapy
"Recently, neoantigen (NA) profiling has been intensively performed for the development of novel immunotherapy. We previously reported a melanoma case with a high tumor mutation burden that achieved complete remission after anti-programmed death-1 therapy. We herein revisited the same case, characterized the NA profiles of other metastatic lesions using <i>in silico</i> algorithms and <i>in vitro</i> CTL assays, and investigated the immunological status, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profile, in metastatic sites. NA candidates obtained from whole-exome sequencing were applied to the HLA-binding prediction algorithm, NetMHCpan4.1. HLA-A*2402-restricted sequence candidates with a strong binding capacity (<50 nM) and elution affinity (<1%) were selected and evaluated for synthetic peptide candidates. The immunological status in metastatic sites was characterized using gene expression profiling, immunohistochemistry, and a TCR repertoire analysis. The genomic analysis revealed that all metastatic sites, such as costal, intra-muscular, and brain lesions, had >1,500 SNVs, and 12 driver mutations were common to all sites. New driver mutations were identified in intra-muscular (KMT2C: p.P3292S) and brain (JAK1: p.S404P) metastases and a functional analysis of these mutations revealed that JAK1 mutation exhibited a promoting effect on invasion activity. CTL assays using synthetic NA peptides identified more NA epitopes in brain metastasis. These results might suggest that the heterogeneity of driver gene mutations is unremarkable, while immunological response is variable in metastatic sites. As a result, the genomic and immunological investigation has provided a very valuable and informative suggestion regarding better cancer therapy decisions.",Immunotherapy,recently neoantigen na profiling intensively performed development novel immunotherapy previously reported melanoma case high tumor mutation burden achieved complete remission antiprogrammed death therapy herein revisited case characterized na profiles metastatic lesions using iin silicoi algorithms iin vitroi ctl assays investigated immunological status including tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes cell receptor tcr repertoire profile metastatic sites na candidates obtained wholeexome sequencing applied hlabinding prediction algorithm netmhcpan hlaarestricted sequence candidates strong binding capacity nm elution affinity selected evaluated synthetic peptide candidates immunological status metastatic sites characterized using gene expression profiling immunohistochemistry tcr repertoire analysis genomic analysis revealed metastatic sites costal intramuscular brain lesions snvs driver mutations common sites new driver mutations identified intramuscular kmtc pps brain jak psp metastases functional analysis mutations revealed jak mutation exhibited promoting effect invasion activity ctl assays using synthetic na peptides identified na epitopes brain metastasis results might suggest heterogeneity driver gene mutations unremarkable immunological response variable metastatic sites result genomic immunological investigation provided valuable informative suggestion regarding better cancer therapy decisions,Immunotherapy
"Dysregulation of protein synthesis, folding, and secretion leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR). While the UPR is essential for cell survival under stress, its chronic activation in cancer cells supports tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance by enabling cellular adaptation to hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the roles of key UPR mediators - binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) - in cancer progression and therapy resistance. Furthermore, it discusses strategies to target UPR pathways, including small molecule inhibitors, gene therapies, natural compounds, and combination therapies, while it evaluates their preclinical and clinical relevance. Finally, it explores how modulating UPR signaling can overcome therapeutic resistance, improve immunotherapy outcomes, and reshape the tumor microenvironment.

"The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway has significantly transformed the landscape of cancer treatment. However, resistance mechanisms such as alternative immune checkpoints, T-cell exhaustion, low tumor burden, and immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment can limit therapeutic efficacy. Recent research has highlighted the role of tumor-derived exosomes expressing PD-L1, which may contribute to resistance by locally and systemically suppressing immune responses. Inhibiting exosome secretion has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The therapeutic potential of targeting exosomes to improve PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition is gaining attention, with preclinical studies showing encouraging results. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the combination of exosome secretion inhibitors with existing checkpoint therapies and provide hope for patients with resistant cancers.",Immunotherapy,development immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death pdprogrammed cell death ligand pdl pathway significantly transformed landscape cancer treatment however resistance mechanisms alternative immune checkpoints tcell exhaustion low tumor burden immunosuppressive cells tumor microenvironment limit therapeutic efficacy recent research highlighted role tumorderived exosomes expressing pdl may contribute resistance locally systemically suppressing immune responses inhibiting exosome secretion shown promise enhancing effectiveness antipdpdl therapies therapeutic potential targeting exosomes improve pdpdl inhibition gaining attention preclinical studies showing encouraging results clinical trials needed evaluate combination exosome secretion inhibitors existing checkpoint therapies provide hope patients resistant cancers,Immunotherapy
"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (Chemo-IM) is associated with significantly improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates and long-term survival outcomes in patient with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, only a small proportion of patients benefit from the addition of immunotherapy. Here, we explored and confirmed the role of intratumoral microbiota in screening patients with TNBC who are likely to benefit from neoadjuvant Chemo-IM. Patients with previously untreated, non-metastatic TNBC receiving neoadjuvant Chemo-IM were enrolled. Differences in the intratumoral microbiota between the pCR and non-pCR groups were explored via 16S rDNA sequencing (16S-seq). Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to profile the tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, correlations between the intratumor microbiota and the TME were explored. Finally, machine-learning models based on the intratumoral microbiota were constructed to predict pCR. A total of 89 female patients with early-stage TNBC treated by neoadjuvant Chemo-IM were enrolled. We found that the pCR group had greater diversity and a higher load of intratumoral microbiota than the non-pCR group. Intriguingly, scRNA-seq revealed significantly increased T cell infiltration and decreased tumor-associated macrophage infiltration into tumors in the pCR group. Moreover, intratumoral microbiota load was positively associated with CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCL13<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and negatively associated with CD68<sup>+</sup>SPP1<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration. Combined analysis of 16S-seq and scRNA-seq data revealed that intratumoral microbiota were present in both cancer and immune cells. Finally, we developed a model incorporating intratumoral microbiota and clinicopathological characteristics, and it showed strong power for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant Chemo-IM. Intratumoral microbiota may serve as a strong and specific predictor of the response of patients with early-stage TNBC to neoadjuvant Chemo-IM. Our findings could contribute to the development of individualized Chemo-IM strategies for treating TNBC.",Immunotherapy,neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined chemotherapy chemoim associated significantly improved pathological complete response pcr rates longterm survival outcomes patient earlystage triplenegative breast cancer tnbc however small proportion patients benefit addition immunotherapy explored confirmed role intratumoral microbiota screening patients tnbc likely benefit neoadjuvant chemoim patients previously untreated nonmetastatic tnbc receiving neoadjuvant chemoim enrolled differences intratumoral microbiota pcr nonpcr groups explored via rdna sequencing sseq singlecell transcriptome sequencing scrnaseq employed profile tumor microenvironment tme moreover correlations intratumor microbiota tme explored finally machinelearning models based intratumoral microbiota constructed predict pcr total female patients earlystage tnbc treated neoadjuvant chemoim enrolled found pcr group greater diversity higher load intratumoral microbiota nonpcr group intriguingly scrnaseq revealed significantly increased cell infiltration decreased tumorassociated macrophage infiltration tumors pcr group moreover intratumoral microbiota load positively associated cdsupsupcxclsupsup cell infiltration negatively associated cdsupsupsppsupsup macrophage infiltration combined analysis sseq scrnaseq data revealed intratumoral microbiota present cancer immune cells finally developed model incorporating intratumoral microbiota clinicopathological characteristics showed strong power predicting pcr neoadjuvant chemoim intratumoral microbiota may serve strong specific predictor response patients earlystage tnbc neoadjuvant chemoim findings could contribute development individualized chemoim strategies treating tnbc,Immunotherapy
"The tumor microenvironment poses significant challenges to reactive oxygen species treatment, and fails to retain small molecule drugs for extended periods, leading to low treatment efficacy. Here, a hyaluronic acid-based nanoplatform (HCCD) for combined chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developed. The nanoplatform links chlorin e6 (Ce6) and doxorubicin (DOX) with hyaluronic acid through a glutathione (GSH)-sensitive disulfide bond, resulting their fluorescence quenching. Notably, their fluorescence and cytotoxicity are specifically activated in tumor cells, not normal ones, due to the endogenous GSH-mediated cleavage of disulfide bonds. Furthermore, PDT is activated in tumor cells with 660 nm laser, and GSH consumption reshapes redox homeostasis balance, thereby synergistically enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy with chemotherapy. HCCD predominantly accumulates in tumors in vivo, enabling precise localization and guidance for PDT and chemotherapy. This approach results in a significant reduction in tumor size, by a factor of 11 compared to the control group, with tumors nearly disappearing. Additionally, HCCD with the toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (R837) and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) activated systemic immune response, suppressing distant tumor growth.

"Cancer, being one of the most outrageous diseases, contributed to 48 % of the mortality in 2022, with lung cancer leading the race with a 12.4 % incidence rate. Conventional treatment modalities like radio-, chemo-, photo-, and immunotherapy employing nanocarriers often face several setbacks, such as non-specific delivery, off-site toxicity, rapid opsonization via the host immune system, and greater tumor recurrence rates. Moreover, the heterogeneous variability in the tumor microenvironment is responsible for existing therapy failure. With the advent of biomimetic nanoparticles as a novel and intriguing platform, researchers have exploited the inherent functionalities of the Cluster of Differentiation proteins (CD) as cell surface biomarkers and imparted the nanocarriers with enhanced homologous tumor targetability, immune evasion capability, and stealth properties, paving the way for improved therapy and diagnosis. This article explores pathogenesis and the multifaceted role of immune cells in non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, the agenda of this article is to shed light on biomimetic nanoarchitectonics with respect to their fabrication, evaluation, and applications unraveling their synergistic effect with conventional therapies.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death and the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide. However, most patients with HCC are at an advanced stage at the time of clinical diagnosis, making surgery impossible. In the past, targeted therapeutic drugs such as sorafenib and lenvatinib were the main treatments. With recent breakthroughs in medicine, immune therapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has garnered interest and has been extensively studied for clinical treatment. In addition to single-agent therapies, combination regimens involving ICIs have also been developed. Despite this progress, not all patients with HCC benefit from immunotherapy. Therefore, to improve the treatment response rates, it is crucial to identify patients with HCC who are suitable for immunotherapy. The exploration and validation of markers to predict the outcomes of immunotherapeutic treatments in patients with HCC are of clinical importance. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of research progress in immunotherapy, particularly ICIs and combination therapies, for HCC.

"Understanding cellular diversity and disease mechanisms requires a global analysis of proteins and their modifications. While next-generation sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, it fails to capture downstream signalling networks. Ultrasensitive mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables unbiased protein-level analysis of low cell numbers, down to single cells. However, phosphoproteomics remains limited to high-input samples due to sample losses and poor reaction efficiencies associated with processing low cell numbers. Isobaric stable isotope labelling is a promising approach for reproducible and accurate quantification of low abundant phosphopeptides. Here, we introduce SPARCE (Streamlined Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Rare CElls) for multiplexed phosphoproteomic analysis of low cell numbers. SPARCE integrates cell isolation, water-based lysis, on-tip TMT labelling, and phosphopeptide enrichment. SPARCE outperforms traditional methods by enhancing labelling efficiency and phosphoproteome coverage. To demonstrate the utility of SPARCE, we analysed four patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell lines, reliably quantifying phosphosite changes from 1000 FACS-sorted cells.

"Therapeutics for thin endometrium (TE) have emerged, with autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy gaining significant attention. In the present study, ten eligible TE patients were recruited for PRP infusion. Endometrial tissue biopsies collected before and after PRP therapy (paired samples) were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additionally, haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to validate changes in protein markers. The results demonstrated PRP therapy increased the average endometrial thickness in these patients. Cellular trajectory reconstruction analysis using gene counts and expression (CytoTRACE) scores indicated that high-stemness cells were more enriched in proliferating stromal cells (pStr) or stromal cells (Str) in post-PRP samples, while greater stemness was observed in glandular epithelial cells (GE) and luminal epithelial cells (LE). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) revealed significant differences in mesenchymal‒epithelial transition (MET)-related gene signature scores between paired samples. Furthermore, an increased number of macrophages, particularly M1-type macrophages, was detected in post-PRP samples. As the first study to investigate the effects of PRP therapy via transcriptomic analysis, our findings suggest PRP therapy may enhance high-stemness, stimulate MET, and boost macrophage function.

"Mapping enhancers and target genes in disease-related cell types provides critical insights into the functional mechanisms of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants. Single-cell multimodal data, which measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same cells, enable the cell-type-specific inference of enhancer-gene pairs. However, this task is challenged by high data sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of pairs. We introduce scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency (1% of existing methods).

"During cancer metastasis, tumor cells migrate from the primary tumor site and spread to distant tissue or organs through the circulatory system of the body. While it is challenging to track metastatic tumor cells, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) via liquid biopsy provide a unique and important opportunity for longitudinal monitoring of residual cancer diseases and progression, showing great potential to facilitate precision medicine in cancer patients. The enumeration and characterization of CTCs represent prognostic and predictive biomarkers, which can be used to monitor the response to and efficacy of various therapies. Along with molecular and cellular features of CTCs, this data can inform the detection of early micro-metastases and assess progression of advanced disease in a more sensitive manner than traditional imaging modalities, serving as a complementary approach with added value. Nevertheless, comprehensive multiomic analyses of CTCs at inter-cellular (cluster), single-cell, and subcellular levels to elucidate relevant CTC cancer biology, tumor immune ecosystem biology, and clinical outcomes have yet to be achieved, demanding multidisciplinary collaboration to advance the field.

"Astrocytes play a key role in the occurrence and development of of ischemic stroke. However, reactive astrocytes have both detrimental and protective roles in ischemic stroke. Regrettably, the stimulation signals associated with the transformation of astrocytes into different subclusters lack systemic analysis, and the mechanism by which astrocytes produce multiple effects is not entirely clear. We investigated the heterogeneity of mouse astrocytes 12h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion via Single-cell RNA sequencing and verified gene expressions by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We acquired astrocyte subclusters' transcriptional characteristics involved in diversified functions. To explore what stimulus signals cause astrocyte heterogeneity, we present a blueprint for cellular communication between astrocyte subclusters and other surrounding brain cells 12h after ischemia-reperfusion, and identified 9 genes which are potential and promising for being therapeutic targets and 6 genes were specific to astrocyte subcluster 2 that tend to resist ischemia-reperfusion injury. At 12h after ischemia-reperfusion, each subcluster of astrocytes is characteristic in terms of function and communication with surrounding cells, which is based on the activation genes and transcription molecules that we have revealed with subcluster characteristics. Our results provide a basis for revealing the anti-injury response of astrocytes to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, which involves coordination of different subclusters and the coordination of astrocytes with surrounding brain cells.",Single-Cell Analysis,astrocytes play key role occurrence development ischemic stroke however reactive astrocytes detrimental protective roles ischemic stroke regrettably stimulation signals associated transformation astrocytes different subclusters lack systemic analysis mechanism astrocytes produce multiple effects entirely clear investigated heterogeneity mouse astrocytes h cerebral ischemiareperfusion via singlecell rna sequencing verified gene expressions reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction acquired astrocyte subclusters transcriptional characteristics involved diversified functions explore stimulus signals cause astrocyte heterogeneity present blueprint cellular communication astrocyte subclusters surrounding brain cells h ischemiareperfusion identified genes potential promising therapeutic targets genes specific astrocyte subcluster tend resist ischemiareperfusion injury h ischemiareperfusion subcluster astrocytes characteristic terms function communication surrounding cells based activation genes transcription molecules revealed subcluster characteristics results provide basis revealing antiinjury response astrocytes cerebral ischemiareperfusion involves coordination different subclusters coordination astrocytes surrounding brain cells,Single-Cell Analysis
"Extranodal extension on radiology(iENE) is reported in single-centre studies to be negatively prognostic in Human papillomavirus-mediated oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+OPC) and is a major eligibility criterion for surgical treatment. However, studies report widely varying sensitivities, specificities and interobserver correlation. In this research the prognostic power, sensitivity and specificity of iENE in HPV+OPC in real-world practice are determined. A retrospective cohort of 821 consecutive subjects with p16+OPC, treated with surgery and/or chemoradiotherapy(CRT), from 13 multinational secondary hospitals in nine countries between 1/1/1999 and 12/31/2020 was analysed. The main outcomes were sensitivity, specificity and overall survival(OS). Assessors were blinded to outcomes. 638 were included in the final analysis. 109/394(27.7%) with no iENE had ENE on histopathology(pENE), and 109/192(56.8%) of patients with pENE were misclassified as having no iENE. iENE sensitivity and specificity were 44.5%(95%CI: 37.8-51.4%) and 87.6%(95%CI: 84.1-90.6%) respectively, and varied significantly between centres. Negative predictive value was 75.3% (95% CI 72.3-77.5%). Subgroup analyses showed significantly increased sensitivity and specificity if patients had both CT and MRI: 84.6%(95%CI: 65.1-95.6%, p<0.001) and 94.5%(95%CI: 82.3-99.4%, p=0.022) respectively, compared to only CT or MRI alone. Specialist radiologists showed better specificities (89.14%(85.69-91.99%) vs 46.67%(21.27-73.41%), p<0.001) and similar sensitivities to non-specialists. On multivariable analysis, iENE positivity was not a statistically significant independent predictor of OS (adjusted hazards ratio(aHR) 1.50(95%CI: 0.97-2.32, p=0.071)) or disease-free survival (aHR 1.41(95%CI 0.95-2.09), p=0.089). Two proposals for amended TNM staging did not yield large improvements. In current real-world practice, iENE showed widely varying and modest accuracy, and was not independently prognostic of outcomes in HPV+OPC. iENE accuracy and prognostic power increased significantly by using combined CT and MRI scanning, experienced head and neck radiologists and more inclusive diagnostic criteria. Validated consensus diagnostic criteria and protocols are urgently needed to enhance the clinical utility of iENE. Until then, clinicians should be cautious about making treatment decisions based on iENE.",Single-Cell Analysis,extranodal extension radiologyiene reported singlecentre studies negatively prognostic human papillomavirusmediated oropharyngeal cancer hpvopc major eligibility criterion surgical treatment however studies report widely varying sensitivities specificities interobserver correlation research prognostic power sensitivity specificity iene hpvopc realworld practice determined retrospective cohort consecutive subjects popc treated surgery andor chemoradiotherapycrt multinational secondary hospitals nine countries analysed main outcomes sensitivity specificity overall survivalos assessors blinded outcomes included final analysis iene ene histopathologypene patients pene misclassified iene iene sensitivity specificity ci ci respectively varied significantly centres negative predictive value ci subgroup analyses showed significantly increased sensitivity specificity patients ct mri ci p ci p respectively compared ct mri alone specialist radiologists showed better specificities vs p similar sensitivities nonspecialists multivariable analysis iene positivity statistically significant independent predictor os adjusted hazards ratioahr ci p diseasefree survival ahr ci p two proposals amended tnm staging yield large improvements current realworld practice iene showed widely varying modest accuracy independently prognostic outcomes hpvopc iene accuracy prognostic power increased significantly using combined ct mri scanning experienced head neck radiologists inclusive diagnostic criteria validated consensus diagnostic criteria protocols urgently needed enhance clinical utility iene clinicians cautious making treatment decisions based iene,Single-Cell Analysis
"Recent studies have suggested a link between nociception and depression. However, the specific genes involved remain unclear. This study investigates this genetic link using multi-omics data. We collected nociception-related genes from the GeneCards database and integrated quantitative trait loci (mQTLs, eQTLs and pQTLs) data for gene expression, DNA methylation and protein expression. GWAS data from the IEU database served as the discovery cohort for depression, with FinnGen and GWAS Catalog data used for validation. Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis was employed to examine the interactions between nociception-related genes and depression, and colocalization analysis identified shared causal variants. The associations between depression and target gene expression in specific tissues and specific cell types were assessed using the GTEx v8 dataset and single-cell eQTL data. SMR analysis revealed 215 mQTLs, 12 eQTLs, and 1 pQTL associated with depression in the discovery cohort. By integrating multi-omics evidence, we found that the hypermethylation of the TNXB gene (cg02272968, cg02432444, cg27624229) and the hypomethylation of the CTNND1 gene (cg16127573) and the P2RY6 gene (cg12889420) were found to upregulate their expression, potentially increasing the risk of depression. GTEx eQTL analysis confirmed CBL expression in the substantia nigra positively correlates with depression risk. However, none of the key genes were confirmed in the single-cell eQTL analysis. Our study emphasizes the importance of nociception-related genes, particularly TNXB, CTNND1 and CBL in the pathogenesis of depression. Future research should build on these findings for potential prevention and treatment strategies.",Single-Cell Analysis,recent studies suggested link nociception depression however specific genes involved remain unclear study investigates genetic link using multiomics data collected nociceptionrelated genes genecards database integrated quantitative trait loci mqtls eqtls pqtls data gene expression dna methylation protein expression gwas data ieu database served discovery cohort depression finngen gwas catalog data used validation summary databased mendelian randomization smr analysis employed examine interactions nociceptionrelated genes depression colocalization analysis identified shared causal variants associations depression target gene expression specific tissues specific cell types assessed using gtex v dataset singlecell eqtl data smr analysis revealed mqtls eqtls pqtl associated depression discovery cohort integrating multiomics evidence found hypermethylation tnxb gene cg cg cg hypomethylation ctnnd gene cg pry gene cg found upregulate expression potentially increasing risk depression gtex eqtl analysis confirmed cbl expression substantia nigra positively correlates depression risk however none key genes confirmed singlecell eqtl analysis study emphasizes importance nociceptionrelated genes particularly tnxb ctnnd cbl pathogenesis depression future research build findings potential prevention treatment strategies,Single-Cell Analysis
"Low-grade glioma (LGG) is a primary brain tumor with high cellular heterogeneity and recurrence, leading to poor prognosis. Standard treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) have limited efficacy. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, is a potential therapeutic target, while dysregulated ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) may drive tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study integrated multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify FRGs associated with LGG prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pseudotime trajectory analysis were performed to investigate their functional roles. Key findings were validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We identified 345 FRGs associated with LGG prognosis, which are involved in oxidative stress response, cell proliferation, and immune regulation. High-risk patients exhibited an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with elevated levels of M2 macrophages and Treg cells but reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted the dynamic roles of macrophages and astrocytes in immune evasion and microenvironment remodeling. Notably, the NUAK2 gene emerged as a key driver of tumor progression and immune suppression. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that targeting NUAK2 significantly reduced tumor cell viability and growth, underscoring its critical regulatory role in LGG. Our study provides comprehensive insights into the role of FRGs in LGG prognosis and tumor microenvironment regulation, with a particular focus on the NUAK2 gene. As a potential therapeutic target, NUAK2's critical role in tumor progression and immune evasion offers a new direction for LGG treatment. Future research should focus on validating NUAK2's role in larger cohorts and exploring its clinical application as a biomarker and therapeutic target.",Single-Cell Analysis,lowgrade glioma lgg primary brain tumor high cellular heterogeneity recurrence leading poor prognosis standard treatments surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy limited efficacy ferroptosis irondependent form regulated cell death potential therapeutic target dysregulated ferroptosisrelated genes frgs may drive tumor progression therapy resistance study integrated multiomics data cancer genome atlas tcga chinese glioma genome atlas cgga gene expression omnibus geo identify frgs associated lgg prognosis singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq pseudotime trajectory analysis performed investigate functional roles key findings validated vitro vivo experiments identified frgs associated lgg prognosis involved oxidative stress response cell proliferation immune regulation highrisk patients exhibited immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment elevated levels macrophages treg cells reduced cd cell infiltration pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted dynamic roles macrophages astrocytes immune evasion microenvironment remodeling notably nuak gene emerged key driver tumor progression immune suppression vitro vivo experiments confirmed targeting nuak significantly reduced tumor cell viability growth underscoring critical regulatory role lgg study provides comprehensive insights role frgs lgg prognosis tumor microenvironment regulation particular focus nuak gene potential therapeutic target nuaks critical role tumor progression immune evasion offers new direction lgg treatment future research focus validating nuaks role larger cohorts exploring clinical application biomarker therapeutic target,Single-Cell Analysis
"Since 2022, mpox has emerged as a global health threat, with two clades (I and II) causing outbreaks of international public health concern. The third generation smallpox vaccine modified vaccinia Ankara, manufactured by Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN), has emerged as a key component of mpox prevention. To date, the immunogenicity of this vaccine, including determinants of response, has been incompletely described, especially when MVA-BN has been administered intradermally at a fifth of the registered dose (so-called fractionated dosing), as recommended as a dose-sparing strategy. The aim of this study was to explore the immunogenicity of MVA-BN and baseline determinants of vaccine response in an observational public-health response setting. We conducted a prospective cohort study and immunological analysis of responses to MVA-BN in patients attending a sexual health vaccination clinic in Oxford, UK. Blood samples were taken at baseline, day 14, and day 28 after first vaccine, and 28 and 90 days following a second vaccine. A subcohort had additional blood samples collected day 1 following their first vaccine (optional timepoint). We assessed IgG responses to mpox and vaccinia antigens using Luminex assay (MpoxPlex) using generalised linear mixed modelling, and T-cell responses using IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot and activation-induced marker assay. Associations between blood transcriptomic signatures (baseline, day 1) and immunogenicity were assessed using differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment methods. We recruited 34 participants between Dec 1, 2022 and May 3, 2023 of whom 33 received fractionated dosing. Of the 30 without previous smallpox vaccination, 14 (47%) seroconverted by day 28, increasing to 25 (89%) 90 days after second vaccination. However, individuals seronegative on day 28 had persistently lower responses compared with individuals seropositive on day 28 (numerically lower antibody responses to six of seven dynamic antigens in the MPoxPlex assay, p<0·05). Serological response on day 28 was positively associated with type I and II interferon signatures 1 day after vaccination (n=18; median module score 0·13 vs 0·06; p=1·1 × 10<sup>-</sup>⁶), but negatively associated with these signatures at baseline (normalised enrichment score -2·81 and -2·86, respectively). Baseline inflammatory states might inhibit MVA-BN serological immunogenicity by inhibiting the upregulation of MVA-induced innate immune signalling. If confirmed mechanistically, these insights could inform improved vaccination strategies against mpox in diverse geographic and demographic settings. Given the likelihood of vaccine supply limitations presently and in future outbreak settings, the utility of dose-sparing vaccine strategies as a general approach to maximising population benefit warrants further study.

"When the available human-derived information at a crime scene is limited, it poses challenges in determining the origin of the biological materials and identifying their donors. In this context, microorganisms have gradually emerged as a valuable complementary tool. Nowadays, the application of third-generation sequencing technology for full-length 16S rRNA sequencing to explore the specific bacterial biomarkers in various biological materials holds significant research and practical value. In this study, we performed full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing on sterile swabs from palmar skin, oral mucosa, and nasal cavity using the PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) platform. Alongside identifying specific bacterial biomarkers for these biological materials from different body sites, the study also preliminarily explored the specific bacterial taxa in 19 individuals at the phylum, genus, and species levels. The results showed that the palmar skin bacteria primarily consist of Cutibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, the oral mucosal bacteria are dominated by Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Haemophilus, while the dominant bacteria in nasal cavity are Staphylococcus and Cutibacterium. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences in the bacterial community composition across the three origins of biological materials. Furthermore, classification models based on the bacterial species were constructed using the Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN algorithms. The results showed that both Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved an accuracy of 97 %, significantly outperforming the KNN model (79 %). The prediction accuracy at the OTU level was comparable to that at the species level. In addition, bacterial community differences between individuals were observed at both the genus and species levels. Overall, this study further explores the potential of classification prediction methods based on bacterial features for distinguishing the body site origins of different biological materials and enabling individual traceability, thereby providing valuable data to support the application of microbiological techniques in forensic practice.",Single-Cell Analysis,available humanderived information crime scene limited poses challenges determining origin biological materials identifying donors context microorganisms gradually emerged valuable complementary tool nowadays application thirdgeneration sequencing technology fulllength rrna sequencing explore specific bacterial biomarkers various biological materials holds significant research practical value study performed fulllength rrna gene sequencing sterile swabs palmar skin oral mucosa nasal cavity using pacbio singlemolecule realtime sequencing smrt platform alongside identifying specific bacterial biomarkers biological materials different body sites study also preliminarily explored specific bacterial taxa individuals phylum genus species levels results showed palmar skin bacteria primarily consist cutibacterium staphylococcus streptococcus oral mucosal bacteria dominated streptococcus neisseria haemophilus dominant bacteria nasal cavity staphylococcus cutibacterium beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences bacterial community composition across three origins biological materials furthermore classification models based bacterial species constructed using random forest xgboost knn algorithms results showed random forest xgboost models achieved accuracy significantly outperforming knn model prediction accuracy otu level comparable species level addition bacterial community differences individuals observed genus species levels overall study explores potential classification prediction methods based bacterial features distinguishing body site origins different biological materials enabling individual traceability thereby providing valuable data support application microbiological techniques forensic practice,Single-Cell Analysis
"This study evaluates the efficacy of arsa-cel gene therapy (GT) in mitigating the severity and progression of peripheral neuropathy as assessed by nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in individuals affected by late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy (LI-MLD). This is a post-hoc analysis conducted on pre-symptomatic patients affected by LI-MLD treated with ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell GT (atidarsagene autotemcel, ""arsa-cel"") in the context of prospective open-label, single-arm, interventional trials and expanded access programs. All patients were followed longitudinally with nerve conduction studies (NCSs) of peripheral motor (ulnar - UN, deep peroneal - DPN) and sensory (median - MN, sural - SN) nerves. These results were compared with those from a control group of untreated patients (NHx) studied with the same standardized protocol. We then analyzed the effects of baseline characteristics (age at treatment, severity of neuropathy pre-treatment expressed as age-matched NCV Z-scores) and arylsulfatase A (ARSA) enzyme activity (measured in peripheral blood myeloid CD15+ cells post treatment) on NCVs of treated patients. The primary endpoint of this post-hoc analysis was NCV, reflecting severity of demyelinating neuropathy. Changes in dermal nerve histopathology in skin biopsies were used as an exploratory outcome. Fifteen treated and 16 NHx patients were included in the analyses, with a median age (IQR) at treatment of 13 (9.1;14.5) months. At 36 months of age, treated patients showed higher estimated NCVs in all nerves compared to age-matched controls (∼15 m/s difference in motor nerves). Peripheral neuropathy was observed in the majority of treated patients at their pre-treatment examination (age range 7.3-17.4 months). Severity of pre-treatment neuropathy in treated patients did not have an effect on NCV values at 2 years post-GT, or on the rate of NCV slowing afterwards. A younger age at treatment was associated with higher NCVs of motor UN and sensory MN 2 years post-GT. Overall, ARSA levels in CD15+ cells correlated with NCVs of motor DPN at 2 years post-GT, and ARSA levels were associated with a slower decrease or a slight increase in NCVs of the DPN, UN and MN nerves afterwards. In summary, peripheral neuropathy assessed by NCV is significantly ameliorated in LI patients treated with arsa-cel compared to untreated patients of similar age. In addition to the potential role of early age at treatment in the preservation of myelin, supraphysiological ARSA levels may slow demyelination of the DPN and other peripheral nerves. Arsa-cel may exert a stronger effect on NCV than allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to its greater ARSA expression.",Single-Cell Analysis,study evaluates efficacy arsacel gene therapy gt mitigating severity progression peripheral neuropathy assessed nerve conduction velocity ncv individuals affected lateinfantile metachromatic leukodystrophy limld posthoc analysis conducted presymptomatic patients affected limld treated ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell gt atidarsagene autotemcel arsacel context prospective openlabel singlearm interventional trials expanded access programs patients followed longitudinally nerve conduction studies ncss peripheral motor ulnar un deep peroneal dpn sensory median mn sural sn nerves results compared control group untreated patients nhx studied standardized protocol analyzed effects baseline characteristics age treatment severity neuropathy pretreatment expressed agematched ncv zscores arylsulfatase arsa enzyme activity measured peripheral blood myeloid cd cells post treatment ncvs treated patients primary endpoint posthoc analysis ncv reflecting severity demyelinating neuropathy changes dermal nerve histopathology skin biopsies used exploratory outcome fifteen treated nhx patients included analyses median age iqr treatment months months age treated patients showed higher estimated ncvs nerves compared agematched controls ms difference motor nerves peripheral neuropathy observed majority treated patients pretreatment examination age range months severity pretreatment neuropathy treated patients effect ncv values years postgt rate ncv slowing afterwards younger age treatment associated higher ncvs motor un sensory mn years postgt overall arsa levels cd cells correlated ncvs motor dpn years postgt arsa levels associated slower decrease slight increase ncvs dpn un mn nerves afterwards summary peripheral neuropathy assessed ncv significantly ameliorated li patients treated arsacel compared untreated patients similar age addition potential role early age treatment preservation myelin supraphysiological arsa levels may slow demyelination dpn peripheral nerves arsacel may exert stronger effect ncv allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due greater arsa expression,Single-Cell Analysis

"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most invasive central nervous system tumors, with rising global incidence. Therapy resistance and poor prognosis highlight the urgent need for new anticancer drugs. Plant alkaloids, a largely unexplored yet promising class of compounds, have previously contributed to oncology treatments. While past reviews provided selective insights, this review aims to collectively compare data from the last decade on (1) plant alkaloid-based anticancer drugs, (2) alkaloid transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and in vivo, (3) alkaloid mechanisms of action in glioblastoma models (in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico), and (4) cytotoxicity and safety profiles. Additionally, innovative drug delivery systems (e.g., nanoparticles and liposomes) are discussed. Focusing on preclinical studies of single plant alkaloids, this review includes 22 botanical families and 28 alkaloids that demonstrated anti-GBM activity. Most alkaloids act in a concentration-dependent manner by (1) reducing glioma cell viability, (2) suppressing proliferation, (3) inhibiting migration and invasion, (4) inducing cell death, (5) downregulating Bcl-2 and key signaling pathways, (6) exhibiting antiangiogenic effects, (7) reducing tumor weight, and (8) improving survival rates. The toxic and adverse effect analysis suggests that alkaloids such as noscapine, lycorine, capsaicin, chelerythrine, caffeine, boldine, and colchicine show favorable therapeutic potential. However, tetrandrine, nitidine, harmine, harmaline, cyclopamine, cocaine, and brucine may pose greater risks than benefits. Piperine's toxicity and berberine's poor bioavailability suggest the need for novel drug formulations. Several alkaloids (kukoamine A, cyclovirobuxine D, α-solanine, oxymatrine, rutaecarpine, and evodiamine) require further pharmacological and toxicological evaluation. Overall, while plant alkaloids show promise in glioblastoma therapy, progress in assessing their BBB penetration remains limited.

"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide; however, despite the development and clinical application of various drugs, the prognosis remains poor. One reason for this is the high rate of recurrence and metastasis. The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory has been proposed to explain their root cause, and removal of CSCs is necessary to cure cancer completely; however, detailed profiles of lung CSCs have not been clarified. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify novel markers for lung CSCs and validated their expression and function in vitro. A549-derived tumorspheres were used as a model for lung CSCs. To identify genes upregulated in CSC-like cells, we reanalyzed two publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from human lung cancer tissues. Additionally, trajectory analysis was performed to examine changes in candidate gene expression during CSC differentiation. The role of these candidate genes in CSC regulation was further investigated through functional assays. Tumorspheres exhibited increased expression of well-established CSC markers. scRNA-seq analysis suggested that SIGMAR1 expression was significantly upregulated in CSC-like cells and decreased with differentiation. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated SIGMAR1 knockdown suppressed tumorsphere self-renewal capacity and reduced CSC marker expression.

"The potential role of immune cells and the precise contributions of genes from various immune cells in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the potential causal relationships between specific immune cell genes and the development of CRC by performing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data for type-specific immune cells were used to perform MR analysis. Outcomes data were obtained from the latest Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), comprising 78,473 European ancestry CRC cases and 107,143 controls. A few sensitivity analyses, encompassing pleiotropy and colocalization analyses, along with the application of False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, were carried out to mitigate potential biases. A total of 395 genes were found to be associated with CRC. After FDR correction, a total of 47 genes across 14 immune cell types were identified. Notably, the FHL3 gene showed the strongest association with CRC in multiple immune cell types, including CD4 + naïve and central memory T cells (CD4NC), CD4 + T cells with an effector memory or central memory phenotype (CD4ET), CD8 + naïve and central memory T cells (CD8NC), CD8 + T cells with an effector memory phenotype (CD8ET), and NK recruiting cells (NKR). Sensitivity analyses and pleiotropy assessments excluded the bias due to weak instruments and linkage disequilibrium. Additionally, the associations were supported by strong evidence of colocalization with CRC. The expression of FHL3 in normal tissue was higher than that in the tumor tissue at the mRNA expression and single-cell levels, and low mRNA expression of FHL3 was associated with shorter survival time in CRC patients. Our study provides a novel perspective on the potential causal link between the low expression of FHL3 gene and the risk of CRC. More evidence is essential to further reveal the biological mechanisms underlying this association.",Single-Cell Analysis,potential role immune cells precise contributions genes various immune cells development colorectal cancer crc remains unclear aimed investigate potential causal relationships specific immune cell genes development crc performing mendelian randomization mr analysis cisexpression quantitative trait loci eqtls data typespecific immune cells used perform mr analysis outcomes data obtained latest genome wide association studies gwas comprising european ancestry crc cases controls sensitivity analyses encompassing pleiotropy colocalization analyses along application false discovery rate fdr correction carried mitigate potential biases total genes found associated crc fdr correction total genes across immune cell types identified notably fhl gene showed strongest association crc multiple immune cell types including cd nave central memory cells cdnc cd cells effector memory central memory phenotype cdet cd nave central memory cells cdnc cd cells effector memory phenotype cdet nk recruiting cells nkr sensitivity analyses pleiotropy assessments excluded bias due weak instruments linkage disequilibrium additionally associations supported strong evidence colocalization crc expression fhl normal tissue higher tumor tissue mrna expression singlecell levels low mrna expression fhl associated shorter survival time crc patients study provides novel perspective potential causal link low expression fhl gene risk crc evidence essential reveal biological mechanisms underlying association,Single-Cell Analysis
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and activated T cells rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. The TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits glycolysis and protects AML cells from apoptosis. Preliminary studies suggest that combining TIGAR inhibition with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) may offer a therapeutic strategy for AML. However, it remains unclear whether silencing TIGAR can enhance T cell function and thereby improve AML prognosis. This study aims to investigate whether TIGAR silencing in host can eliminate AML cells and rejuvenate dysfunctional T cells with mouse models. TIGAR knockout mice on the C57BL/6J background were generated and AML mouse models were established through intravenous injection of C1498 cells. We found that TIGAR depletion enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and raised CD4/CD8 ratio, downregulating CD44 and immune checkpoints CTLA-4, LAG-3, PD-1 on cell surface of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. TIGAR depletion boosted cytokine secretion (IFN-γ, perforin, granzyme B, TNF-α) by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-2, TNF-α by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, improving cytotoxicity against AML cells, proliferation, and reducing apoptosis. TIGAR suppression in host with 2-DG prolonged AML mouse survival, decreased tumor burden, and leukemic infiltration. TIGAR suppression restored thymic T cell development and peripheral immune balance. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis also revealed that high TIGAR expression influences the glycolysis pathway, and correlates with markers of T cell exhaustion. This study indicates that blocking TIGAR prevents CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction and induces anti-AML immunity.",Single-Cell Analysis,acute myeloid leukemia aml cells activated cells rely aerobic glycolysis energy metabolism tpinduced glycolysis apoptosis regulator tigar inhibits glycolysis protects aml cells apoptosis preliminary studies suggest combining tigar inhibition glycolysis inhibitor deoxydglucose dg may offer therapeutic strategy aml however remains unclear whether silencing tigar enhance cell function thereby improve aml prognosis study aims investigate whether tigar silencing host eliminate aml cells rejuvenate dysfunctional cells mouse models tigar knockout mice cblj background generated aml mouse models established intravenous injection c cells found tigar depletion enhanced cdsupsup cell counts raised cdcd ratio downregulating cd immune checkpoints ctla lag pd cell surface cdsupsup cells tigar depletion boosted cytokine secretion ifn perforin granzyme b tnf cdsupsup cells il tnf cdsupsup cells improving cytotoxicity aml cells proliferation reducing apoptosis tigar suppression host dg prolonged aml mouse survival decreased tumor burden leukemic infiltration tigar suppression restored thymic cell development peripheral immune balance singlecell rna sequencing analysis also revealed high tigar expression influences glycolysis pathway correlates markers cell exhaustion study indicates blocking tigar prevents cdsupsup cell dysfunction induces antiaml immunity,Single-Cell Analysis
"There is increasing interest in developing therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific characteristics of inflammation across different cell types and the underlying mechanisms of PD-related inflammation remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted an analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and microarray data derived from human PD midbrain tissue, specifically focusing on the substantia nigra compacta (SNc). These datasets were sourced from the (GEO) database. We utilized GSVA, GSEA, as well as KEGG and GO analyses to explore transcriptional variations associated with PD. Furthermore, trajectory and SCENIC analyses were conducted to uncover the mechanisms underlying PD progression. Subsequent animal and cellular experiments validated the role of the regulon in regulating neuroinflammation. Results: Our analysis revealed that microglia displayed the highest levels of inflammatory activity, characterized by an increased abundance of microglia in the proinflammatory activated state within the midbrain and SNc of PD patients. This finding was further validated in a PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The transcription factor STAT3 demonstrated significant upregulation and was implicated in promoting the inflammatory response and activating microglia within the PD context. In the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP +)-induced BV2 cell model, inhibition of STAT3 led to reduced levels of inflammation, hindered STAT3 phosphorylation, and decreased the production of inflammatory factors. Furthermore, the downregulation of P-STAT3 alleviated the harmful effects on SH-SY5Y cells that were cocultured in the conditioned medium. Conclusions: Our study underscored the pivotal role of the transcription factor STAT3 as a central regulator of proinflammatory activation in microglia within PD. These findings offer fresh insights into PD pathogenesis and suggest potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",Single-Cell Analysis,increasing interest developing therapeutic interventions aimed preventing neuroinflammation parkinsons disease pd however specific characteristics inflammation across different cell types underlying mechanisms pdrelated inflammation remain inadequately understood study conducted analysis singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq microarray data derived human pd midbrain tissue specifically focusing substantia nigra compacta snc datasets sourced geo database utilized gsva gsea well kegg go analyses explore transcriptional variations associated pd furthermore trajectory scenic analyses conducted uncover mechanisms underlying pd progression subsequent animal cellular experiments validated role regulon regulating neuroinflammation results analysis revealed microglia displayed highest levels inflammatory activity characterized increased abundance microglia proinflammatory activated state within midbrain snc pd patients finding validated pd mouse model induced methylphenyltetrahydropyridine mptp transcription factor stat demonstrated significant upregulation implicated promoting inflammatory response activating microglia within pd context methylphenylpyridine mpp induced bv cell model inhibition stat led reduced levels inflammation hindered stat phosphorylation decreased production inflammatory factors furthermore downregulation pstat alleviated harmful effects shsyy cells cocultured conditioned medium conclusions study underscored pivotal role transcription factor stat central regulator proinflammatory activation microglia within pd findings offer fresh insights pd pathogenesis suggest potential avenues development novel therapeutic strategies,Single-Cell Analysis
"This study investigated the genetic diversity, phylogeny, and evolutionary dynamics of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) across seven regions in Saudi Arabia. Analyzing 28 full-length TYLCV genomes, phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clades: one predominantly comprised of isolates from the Ahsa (Eastern province) region and the other encompassing isolates from Northern and Western regions. The Ahsa region exhibited significantly higher TYLCV prevalence and genetic diversity, harboring the most divergent isolates with high haplotype (Hd = 1.00) and nucleotide (π = 0.079) diversity. Conversely, regions like Jeddah and Hadasham showed lower diversity, suggesting less or stable viral populations. Genetic diversity analyses revealed high variation in coding regions like CP and Rep, which are under strong selective pressures and prone to recombination. Conversely, V2 displayed lower diversity, indicating purifying selection. Selection pressure analysis using dN/dS ratios indicated diversifying selection in C4 (2.20) and Rep (1.28). Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting identified one positively selected site in Rep. In contrast, Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation identified multiple sites in C4 (8), TrAP (7), REn (6), and V2 (1), suggesting roles in host adaptation and immune evasion. A total of 32 credible recombination events, predominantly in Ahsa isolates, were identified using RDP and confirmed by GARD analysis. These events, involving both inter- and intraspecies recombination, play a crucial role in enhancing TYLCV genetic diversity and adaptability. The conservation of motifs in V2 and C4 indicated their essential roles in TYLCV function. In contrast, variations in ORFs like CP, Rep, TrAP, and REn among specific isolates may promote viral diversity and adaptation. This study demonstrates the crucial role of geographic and genetic factors, with Ahsa as a key hub for TYLCV diversity, in driving viral evolution and diversification. The findings emphasize the need to monitor regions with high viral diversity, like Ahsa, and develop strategies to manage TYLCV's swift spread.",Single-Cell Analysis,study investigated genetic diversity phylogeny evolutionary dynamics tomato yellow leaf curl virus tylcv across seven regions saudi arabia analyzing fulllength tylcv genomes phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clades one predominantly comprised isolates ahsa eastern province region encompassing isolates northern western regions ahsa region exhibited significantly higher tylcv prevalence genetic diversity harboring divergent isolates high haplotype hd nucleotide diversity conversely regions like jeddah hadasham showed lower diversity suggesting less stable viral populations genetic diversity analyses revealed high variation coding regions like cp rep strong selective pressures prone recombination conversely v displayed lower diversity indicating purifying selection selection pressure analysis using dnds ratios indicated diversifying selection c rep single likelihood ancestor counting identified one positively selected site rep contrast fast unconstrained bayesian approximation identified multiple sites c trap ren v suggesting roles host adaptation immune evasion total credible recombination events predominantly ahsa isolates identified using rdp confirmed gard analysis events involving inter intraspecies recombination play crucial role enhancing tylcv genetic diversity adaptability conservation motifs v c indicated essential roles tylcv function contrast variations orfs like cp rep trap ren among specific isolates may promote viral diversity adaptation study demonstrates crucial role geographic genetic factors ahsa key hub tylcv diversity driving viral evolution diversification findings emphasize need monitor regions high viral diversity like ahsa develop strategies manage tylcvs swift spread,Single-Cell Analysis
"Cordyceps, a genus of ascomycete fungi, are renowned for their medicinal and functional food applications, and are attributed to bioactive compounds such as nucleosides, lipids, saccharides, and amino acids. Among its species, Ophiocordyceps sinensis has significant pharmacological value, impacting multiple organ systems and exhibiting antioxidant and antitumor properties. Although natural populations are limited, artificial cultivation has provided a sustainable source of medicinal products. This study investigated the volatile components of O. sinensis mycelia from five regions, Tibet, Yunnan, Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Fifty volatile substances were identified, including hydrocarbons, acids, esters, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, and ketones, with hydrocarbons being the most abundant (60%). Cluster analysis highlighted significant differences in the volatile profiles between populations, with 12 common compounds identified across all regions. Population-specific variations in volatile classes, such as hydrocarbons, acids, and alcohols, were observed, suggesting a composite odor profile for O. sinensis rather than a single characteristic scent.

"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive and lethal tumor with a poor prognosis. FOLFIRINOX improves the prognosis of patients with PC; however, despite UGT1A1 screening, adverse events, such as severe neutropenia, occur frequently. This study aimed to identify the novel biomarkers of severe neutropenia in patients treated with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) for PC. In this study, patients with PC treated with mFFX (n = 71) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) (n = 92) and patients with colorectal cancer treated with FOLFOXIRI (n = 50) were included. Genome-wide screening using whole-exome sequencing was performed during the screening phase. Validation analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction genotyping, the Cochran-Armitage trend test, and multivariate analysis. The diagnostic performance of combined risk factors for severe neutropenia was examined using logistic regression with leave-one-out cross-validation. Three gene polymorphisms were selected from the screening phase and subjected to the validation phase. In the validation phase, a single nucleotide polymorphism in C11orf24 (c.448C>T, rs901827) was significantly correlated with ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia in mFFX and FOLFOXIRI but not in GnP. Multivariate analysis showed C11orf24 and baseline neutrophil count as independent risk factors for ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia. The diagnostic performance of the neutropenia prediction model showed areas under the curve of 0.754 (sensitivity = 0.605, specificity = 0.848) and 0.856 (sensitivity = 0.800, specificity = 0.893) for ≥ Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia, respectively.

"Mas, a newly identified G-protein-coupled receptor, is prevalent in myeloid-derived immune cells and plays a key role in inflammation. This study investigates Mas signaling and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in acute liver failure (ALF), aiming to elucidate their mechanisms. Male Mas1<sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type mice, aged 6-8 weeks, receive intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-Gal) (L/G) to study NETs formation. Hepatic Mas expression increases in WT-L/G mice, whereas systemic Mas1 knockout significantly reduces L/G-induced NETs and hepatotoxicity. Antibiotics treatment and co-housing (Mas1<sup>-/-</sup>-L/G and WT-L/G mice) experiments show that gut flora influences the disease phenotype in Mas1<sup>-/-</sup>-L/G mice. Fecal metabolite analysis suggests that mice may be protected by reduced deoxycholic acid (DCA) production in Mas1<sup>-/-</sup> activated hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR), suppressing sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-dependent NETs.

"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is associated with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. There is increasing recognition that SCLC harbors molecular heterogeneity. Using a new liquid biopsy assay, it is demonstrated that SCLC subtypes, as determined by patient tumor tissue staining and cell lines, can be accurately identified by measuring the mRNA expression of subtype transcription factors (ASCL1, POU2F3, and NEUROD1) in circulating exosome-rich extracellular vesicles (Exo). Additionally, upregulation of Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) mRNA in Exo and its membrane protein (mProtein) in extracellular vesicles associated with tumor (tEV) may distinguish both limited- and extensive-stage SCLC patients from high-risk smokers, with AUC/ROC values of 0.836 and 0.839, respectively. By incorporating Exo-ASCL1 and Exo-POU2F3 mRNA expression with DLL3 Exo-mRNA/tEV-mProtein expression, the classifier enhances the AUC/ROC to 0.912 and 0.963 for limited- and extensive-stage SCLC patients, respectively.",Single-Cell Analysis,small cell lung cancer sclc associated high mortality limited therapeutic options increasing recognition sclc harbors molecular heterogeneity using new liquid biopsy assay demonstrated sclc subtypes determined patient tumor tissue staining cell lines accurately identified measuring mrna expression subtype transcription factors ascl pouf neurod circulating exosomerich extracellular vesicles exo additionally upregulation deltalike ligand dll mrna exo membrane protein mprotein extracellular vesicles associated tumor tev may distinguish limited extensivestage sclc patients highrisk smokers aucroc values respectively incorporating exoascl exopouf mrna expression dll exomrnatevmprotein expression classifier enhances aucroc limited extensivestage sclc patients respectively,Single-Cell Analysis
"Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) play a critical role in cancer immunity and their presence in solid tumors is associated with improved prognosis and response to therapy. Although TRM have been identified and their function characterized in lung cancers, little is known regarding TRM outside of a tissue context, such as within malignant pleural effusions (MPE). As MPE are routinely drained and collected to manage symptoms, analysis of this fluid can provide an insight into the peri-tumoral environment. In this study, we performed flow cytometry and single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) on MPE associated with non-small lung cancer and examined the phenotype and function of TRM. We found that 14% of CD8+ T cells and 6% of CD4+ T cells were TRM, as defined by the phenotype of CD45RO+CCR7-CD62L- and expressing 1 or both of CD69 and CD103. The scRNAseq revealed distinct clusters expressing TRM-associated genes including ITGAE and CD49A and lacking expression of SELL, CCR7, and IL7RA. TRM did not differ from other memory T cell subsets, such as T central memory (TCM) and T effector memory (TEM) cells, in expression of the inhibitory markers PD-1, TIGIT, and CD39. When TRM function was assessed by measuring the production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and CD107a after stimulation with αnti-CD3 antibodies in vitro, TRM had comparable function to T effector cells (TE), indicating that despite expression of exhaustion markers these cells retained effector function. Finally, we found that CD69 expression, and not CD103 expression, on TRM was associated with production of effector cytokines.",Single-Cell Analysis,tissue resident memory cells trm play critical role cancer immunity presence solid tumors associated improved prognosis response therapy although trm identified function characterized lung cancers little known regarding trm outside tissue context within malignant pleural effusions mpe mpe routinely drained collected manage symptoms analysis fluid provide insight peritumoral environment study performed flow cytometry single cell rnaseq scrnaseq mpe associated nonsmall lung cancer examined phenotype function trm found cd cells cd cells trm defined phenotype cdroccrcdl expressing cd cd scrnaseq revealed distinct clusters expressing trmassociated genes including itgae cda lacking expression sell ccr ilra trm differ memory cell subsets central memory tcm effector memory tem cells expression inhibitory markers pd tigit cd trm function assessed measuring production ifn tnf cda stimulation nticd antibodies vitro trm comparable function effector cells te indicating despite expression exhaustion markers cells retained effector function finally found cd expression cd expression trm associated production effector cytokines,Single-Cell Analysis
"Aging induces significant alterations in the immune system, with immunosenescence contributing to age-related diseases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) offer a convenient and comprehensive snapshot of the body's immune status. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of PBMCs using both bulk-cell and single-cell RNA-seq data, spanning from children to frail elderlies, to investigate age-related changes. We observed dynamic changes in the PBMC transcriptome during healthy aging, including dramatic shifts in inflammation, myeloid cells, and lymphocyte features during early life, followed by relative stability in later stages. Conversely, frail elderly individuals exhibited notable disruptions in peripheral immune cells, including an increased senescent phenotype in monocytes with elevated inflammatory cytokine expression, heightened effector activation in regulatory T cells, and functional impairment of cytotoxic lymphocytes.

"The rapidly emerging large-scale data in diverse biological research fields present valuable opportunities to explore the underlying mechanisms of tissue development and disease progression. However, few existing methods can simultaneously capture common and condition-specific association between different types of features across different biological conditions, such as cancer types or cell populations. Therefore, we developed the sparse tensor-based partial least squares (sTPLS) method, which integrates multiple pairs of datasets containing two types of features but derived from different biological conditions. We demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of sTPLS through simulation study and three biological applications. By integrating the pairwise pharmacogenomic data, sTPLS identified 11 gene-drug comodules with high biological functional relevance specific for seven cancer types and two comodules that shared across multi-type cancers, such as breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. When applied to single-cell data, it uncovered nine gene-peak comodules representing transcriptional regulatory relationships specific for five cell types and three comodules shared across similar cell types, such as intermediate and naïve B cells. Furthermore, sTPLS can be directly applied to tensor-structured data, successfully revealing shared and distinct cell communication patterns mediated by the MK signaling pathway in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and healthy controls. These results highlight the effectiveness of sTPLS in identifying biologically meaningful relationships across diverse conditions, making it useful for multi-omics integrative analysis.",Single-Cell Analysis,rapidly emerging largescale data diverse biological research fields present valuable opportunities explore underlying mechanisms tissue development disease progression however existing methods simultaneously capture common conditionspecific association different types features across different biological conditions cancer types cell populations therefore developed sparse tensorbased partial least squares stpls method integrates multiple pairs datasets containing two types features derived different biological conditions demonstrated effectiveness versatility stpls simulation study three biological applications integrating pairwise pharmacogenomic data stpls identified genedrug comodules high biological functional relevance specific seven cancer types two comodules shared across multitype cancers breast ovarian colorectal cancers applied singlecell data uncovered nine genepeak comodules representing transcriptional regulatory relationships specific five cell types three comodules shared across similar cell types intermediate nave b cells furthermore stpls directly applied tensorstructured data successfully revealing shared distinct cell communication patterns mediated mk signaling pathway coronavirus disease patients healthy controls results highlight effectiveness stpls identifying biologically meaningful relationships across diverse conditions making useful multiomics integrative analysis,Single-Cell Analysis

"This paper presents two new non-isolated DC-DC converters with and without a coupled inductor based on quadratic voltage conversion. Firstly, the coupled inductor-less type is explained in detail. It employs a voltage-boosting cell and a modified SEPIC structure to provide a high voltage boost ability with a lower and practical value for the switching duty cycle. This allows for lower power loss compared to conventional DC-DC converters. Having only one switch in the proposed converter simplifies the control and reduces the required number of control signals. Furthermore, the presented transformer-less structure can help avoid producing huge voltage spikes across the power switch. In traditional quadratic SEPIC converters, the voltage-boosting cell's capacitor experiences relatively high voltage stress due to the voltage multiplication process. In contrast, the proposed converter offers significantly lower voltage stresses. Hence, it becomes possible to utilize a capacitor with a lower voltage rating, leading to cost savings and improved reliability and availability of suitable components. The first topology can be improved for ultrahigh voltage applications by replacing the middle inductor with a coupled transformer. Consequently, a higher voltage range with a lower switching duty cycle can be attained. Theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations are provided, and the comparison section claims the proposed converter's ability to minimize voltage stress across the switch and output diode. Finally, experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converters at an output power of 260 W.",Single-Cell Analysis,paper presents two new nonisolated dcdc converters without coupled inductor based quadratic voltage conversion firstly coupled inductorless type explained detail employs voltageboosting cell modified sepic structure provide high voltage boost ability lower practical value switching duty cycle allows lower power loss compared conventional dcdc converters one switch proposed converter simplifies control reduces required number control signals furthermore presented transformerless structure help avoid producing huge voltage spikes across power switch traditional quadratic sepic converters voltageboosting cells capacitor experiences relatively high voltage stress due voltage multiplication process contrast proposed converter offers significantly lower voltage stresses hence becomes possible utilize capacitor lower voltage rating leading cost savings improved reliability availability suitable components first topology improved ultrahigh voltage applications replacing middle inductor coupled transformer consequently higher voltage range lower switching duty cycle attained theoretical analysis mathematical derivations provided comparison section claims proposed converters ability minimize voltage stress across switch output diode finally experimental results given verify effectiveness proposed converters output power w,Single-Cell Analysis
"Persistent infection with HPV causes nearly 5% of all cancers worldwide, including cervical and oropharyngeal cancers. Compared to HPV-negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), HPV-positive (HPV+) HNSCCs exhibit a significantly improved treatment response; however, established treatment regimens were largely developed for HPV- disease. Effectively de-escalating therapy and optimizing treatment protocols to minimize toxicity for both HPV+ and HPV- tumors has been variably successful, in part due to the heterogeneity of cellular subpopulations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has primarily been used to define immune cell populations rather than the cell type of origin, epithelial cells. To address this, we analyzed published scRNAseq data of HPV+ and HPV- HNSCCs to distinguish epithelial tumor cell populations as a function of HPV status. We identified the transcriptome signatures, ontologies, and candidate biomarkers of newly identified epithelial subpopulations with attention to those that are shared or enriched in HPV+ or HPV- HNSCCs. We hypothesize that distinct epithelial cell populations and reprogramming in HPV- versus HPV+ HNSCC represent important components of the pro-tumor environment. These are described here as a foundation for the identification of new epithelial-cell-specific biomarkers, effectors, and candidate targets for optimizing the treatment of HNSCC.",Single-Cell Analysis,persistent infection hpv causes nearly cancers worldwide including cervical oropharyngeal cancers compared hpvnegative hpv head neck squamous cell carcinomas hnsccs hpvpositive hpv hnsccs exhibit significantly improved treatment response however established treatment regimens largely developed hpv disease effectively deescalating therapy optimizing treatment protocols minimize toxicity hpv hpv tumors variably successful part due heterogeneity cellular subpopulations singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq primarily used define immune cell populations rather cell type origin epithelial cells address analyzed published scrnaseq data hpv hpv hnsccs distinguish epithelial tumor cell populations function hpv status identified transcriptome signatures ontologies candidate biomarkers newly identified epithelial subpopulations attention shared enriched hpv hpv hnsccs hypothesize distinct epithelial cell populations reprogramming hpv versus hpv hnscc represent important components protumor environment described foundation identification new epithelialcellspecific biomarkers effectors candidate targets optimizing treatment hnscc,Single-Cell Analysis
"This retrospective, multicenter study aimed to identify key computed tomography (CT) features that differentiate renal cell carcinoma (RCC) from lymphoma, the two most common feline renal neoplasms. CT images from 25 cats with renal tumors (15 RCC and 10 lymphoma) were evaluated. Of the RCC cases, 10 were diagnosed through histopathology and 5 through FNA. Among the lymphoma cases, two were extranodal lymphoma, including one case of primary renal lymphoma, and eight were gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma with renal involvement. Qualitative features (tumor distribution, growth pattern, and enhancement characteristics) and quantitative parameters (tumor size and attenuation values) from triphasic or single post-contrast-enhanced CT scans were analyzed and compared. RCC typically presented as unilateral (93.3%) masses with expansile growth (73.3%) and heterogeneous enhancement among contrast-enhancing tumors (100%).

"A powerful strategy to accelerate bioprocess development is to complement parallel bioreactor systems with an automated approach, often achieved using liquid handling stations. The benefit of such high-throughput experiments is determined by the employed monitoring procedures. To gain a molecular understanding of the microbial production strains in miniaturized parallel single-use bioreactors, we extended the at-line monitoring procedures to transcriptome analysis in a parallel approach using RNA-Seq. To perform automated RNA-Seq experiments, we developed a sample preparation workflow consisting of at-line cell disruption by enzymatic cell lysis, total RNA extraction, nucleic acid concentration normalization, and Nanopore cDNA Library preparation. The pH-controlled aerobic batch growth of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> was studied with six different carbon sources (glucose, pyruvate, fructose, galactose, sucrose, and mannose) on a 11 mL scale using 24 parallel stirred tank bioreactors integrated into a liquid handling station while performing at-line sample preparation for RNA-Seq on the same deck. With four biological replicates per condition, 24 cDNA libraries were prepared over 11.5 h. Off-line Nanopore sequencing yielded 20.97 M classified reads with a Q-score > 9. Differential gene expression analysis revealed significant differences in transcriptomic profiles when comparing growth with glucose (exponential growth) to growth with pyruvate (stress conditions), allowing identification of 674 downregulated and 709 upregulated genes. Insignificant changes in gene expression patterns were measured when comparing growth with glucose and fructose, yielding only 64 differentially expressed genes. The expected differences in cellular responses identified in this study show a promising approach for transcriptomic profiling of bioreactor cultures, providing valuable insights on a molecular level at-line in a high-throughput fashion.",Single-Cell Analysis,powerful strategy accelerate bioprocess development complement parallel bioreactor systems automated approach often achieved using liquid handling stations benefit highthroughput experiments determined employed monitoring procedures gain molecular understanding microbial production strains miniaturized parallel singleuse bioreactors extended atline monitoring procedures transcriptome analysis parallel approach using rnaseq perform automated rnaseq experiments developed sample preparation workflow consisting atline cell disruption enzymatic cell lysis total rna extraction nucleic acid concentration normalization nanopore cdna library preparation phcontrolled aerobic batch growth isaccharomyces cerevisiaei studied six different carbon sources glucose pyruvate fructose galactose sucrose mannose ml scale using parallel stirred tank bioreactors integrated liquid handling station performing atline sample preparation rnaseq deck four biological replicates per condition cdna libraries prepared h offline nanopore sequencing yielded classified reads qscore differential gene expression analysis revealed significant differences transcriptomic profiles comparing growth glucose exponential growth growth pyruvate stress conditions allowing identification downregulated upregulated genes insignificant changes gene expression patterns measured comparing growth glucose fructose yielding differentially expressed genes expected differences cellular responses identified study show promising approach transcriptomic profiling bioreactor cultures providing valuable insights molecular level atline highthroughput fashion,Single-Cell Analysis
"<b>Background:</b> Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-most diagnosed cancer among males and the second-most diagnosed cancer among females. In cancer, stem cells are a subset of neoplastic cells capable of tumorigenesis and exhibit properties like normal stem cells. Moreover, they are resistant to conventional cancer treatments and can repopulate the tumor following treatment. Cancer cells are stimulated to undergo apoptosis by photodynamic therapy (PDT), which involves a light source, a photosensitizer, and reactive oxygen species. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, colon cancer stem cells were isolated from colon cancer cells and characterized using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence techniques. To treat colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were coupled with hyaluronic acid (HA) and loaded with chlorin-e6 (Ce6). Nanobiocomposite toxicity was assessed using CCSCs with two fluences of 5 J/cm<sup>2</sup> and 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.

"<b>Background:</b> Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and epigenetic modifier enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) have emerged as promising options in the pharmacotherapy of malignant tumors. Recently, we demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects of the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib and the EZH2 inhibitors GSK126 or tazemetostat in patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) models. Importantly, all three drugs are substrates of the two most important plasma membrane multidrug transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, with abemaciclib and tazemetostat also being inhibitors of these proteins. <b>Methods:</b> To investigate whether increased intracellular accumulation of either of the two drugs used in combination could have contributed to corresponding synergisms, we developed a simple LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous detection of the three substances in cell culture lysates. The method was validated in accordance with the current International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guideline M10 on bioanalytical method validation and study sample analysis. <b>Results:</b> All acceptance criteria were met. Subsequent analysis of intracellular drug concentrations confirmed increased cellular uptake of tazemetostat in the presence of abemaciclib in both GBM cell lines studied compared to single agent treatment. A comparable pattern was also observed for GSK126, but in only one of the two cell lines used. <b>Conclusions:</b> In conclusion, the observed synergistic antitumor effect could be partly due to increased intracellular accumulation, although this alone is certainly not sufficient to explain it. Overall, the developed method provides a valuable approach for characterizing interactions at the transport level and for predicting the efficiency of both anticancer substance classes in different cell lines.",Single-Cell Analysis,bbackgroundb inhibitors cyclindependent kinases cdks epigenetic modifier enhancer zeste homolog ezh emerged promising options pharmacotherapy malignant tumors recently demonstrated synergistic antitumor effects cdk inhibitor abemaciclib ezh inhibitors gsk tazemetostat patientderived glioblastoma gbm models importantly three drugs substrates two important plasma membrane multidrug transporters abcb abcg abemaciclib tazemetostat also inhibitors proteins bmethodsb investigate whether increased intracellular accumulation either two drugs used combination could contributed corresponding synergisms developed simple lcmsms method simultaneous detection three substances cell culture lysates method validated accordance current international council harmonization technical requirements pharmaceuticals human use ich guideline bioanalytical method validation study sample analysis bresultsb acceptance criteria met subsequent analysis intracellular drug concentrations confirmed increased cellular uptake tazemetostat presence abemaciclib gbm cell lines studied compared single agent treatment comparable pattern also observed gsk one two cell lines used bconclusionsb conclusion observed synergistic antitumor effect could partly due increased intracellular accumulation although alone certainly sufficient explain overall developed method provides valuable approach characterizing interactions transport level predicting efficiency anticancer substance classes different cell lines,Single-Cell Analysis
"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of the red cell distribution width-to-estimated glomerular filtration rate (RGR) ratio in patients hospitalized with chronic heart failure (CHF) and its potential interaction with NT-proBNP levels. By integrating anemia and renal dysfunction markers, the RGR may provide enhanced predictive insights regarding extended length of hospital stay (ELOS) > 7 days, in-hospital mortality, and 6-month all-cause mortality across specific CHF phenotypes. <b>Methods:</b> In this retrospective, single-center pilot observational study, 627 CHF admissions (January 2022-August 2024) were analyzed. Patients were classified according to the ESC guidelines into heart failure with reduced (HFrEF), mildly reduced (HFmrEF), or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The RGR was calculated as red cell distribution width standard deviation (RDW-SD) divided by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Predictive accuracy was evaluated using logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, and stepwise Cox proportional hazard regression. <b>Results:</b> RGR was significantly higher in HFrEF than in HFpEF (<i>p</i> = 0.042) and predicted ELOS only in HFpEF (AUC = 0.619). In contrast, for in-hospital mortality, RGR achieved excellent discrimination in HFrEF (AUC = 0.945), outperforming RDW and NT-proBNP. In HFmrEF, RDW exhibited the highest predictive power (AUC = 0.826), whereas in HFpEF, NT-proBNP was the strongest predictor (AUC = 0.958), although RGR preserved good discrimination (AUC = 0.746). Across the entire cohort and HF phenotypes, RGR consistently emerged as a significant predictor in univariable analysis. In multivariable models, it improved the significance prognosis especially alongside NT-proBNP in the entire cohort and HFrEF. For 6-month all-cause mortality, RGR surpassed RDW in prediction in all HF phenotypes. <b>Conclusions:</b> The RGR independently predicts prolonged hospitalization, in-hospital, and 6-month mortality in CHF-often outperforming RDW and eGFR and being comparable to NT-proBNP, especially in HFrEF. These findings suggest that RGR may serve as a valuable risk stratification tool in CHF management.",Single-Cell Analysis,bbackgroundobjectivesb study aimed investigate prognostic value red cell distribution widthtoestimated glomerular filtration rate rgr ratio patients hospitalized chronic heart failure chf potential interaction ntprobnp levels integrating anemia renal dysfunction markers rgr may provide enhanced predictive insights regarding extended length hospital stay elos days inhospital mortality month allcause mortality across specific chf phenotypes bmethodsb retrospective singlecenter pilot observational study chf admissions january august analyzed patients classified according esc guidelines heart failure reduced hfref mildly reduced hfmref preserved ejection fraction hfpef rgr calculated red cell distribution width standard deviation rdwsd divided estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr predictive accuracy evaluated using logistic regression receiver operating characteristic roc analyses stepwise cox proportional hazard regression bresultsb rgr significantly higher hfref hfpef ipi predicted elos hfpef auc contrast inhospital mortality rgr achieved excellent discrimination hfref auc outperforming rdw ntprobnp hfmref rdw exhibited highest predictive power auc whereas hfpef ntprobnp strongest predictor auc although rgr preserved good discrimination auc across entire cohort hf phenotypes rgr consistently emerged significant predictor univariable analysis multivariable models improved significance prognosis especially alongside ntprobnp entire cohort hfref month allcause mortality rgr surpassed rdw prediction hf phenotypes bconclusionsb rgr independently predicts prolonged hospitalization inhospital month mortality chfoften outperforming rdw egfr comparable ntprobnp especially hfref findings suggest rgr may serve valuable risk stratification tool chf management,Single-Cell Analysis

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Chlamydial infection is the most common asymptomatic infection worldwide. Despite all national programs, strategies and guidelines, chlamydial infection is still the leading infection worldwide, especially in young populations. We have tried to summarize the best diagnostic tools for its detection. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: In the study, 225 sexually active patients who were tested for chlamydial infection at the Institute of Public Health Kragujevac participated. <i>Results</i>: Combinations of direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and a rapid lateral immunochromatographic test (RT) and combinations of an RT and immunoglobulin G (IgG) do not improve diagnostic efficiency when compared to a rapid test that individually had the best parameters. In situations that require high specificity, the recommended combination is RT/IgA, which as a highly specific test has few false positive results, while the combinations of DIF + RT and RT + IgG, although showing a specificity of 100%, have low sensitivity (33.30%), due to which we prefer the RT/IgA combination. The combinations DIF + RT, DIF + RT + IgG and RT + IgG, although with low sensitivity, have the highest values of specificity, and the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) show the highest values of the extended Youden index of 130.30% and the highest values of total diagnostic accuracy of 97.00%.

"<b>Background</b>: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a well-established curative treatment option for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in second complete remission (CR2). However, whether the addition of consolidation chemotherapy after achieving CR2 can improve transplant outcomes remains controversial. <b>Methods</b>: In this single-center retrospective study, we analyzed consecutive AML patients who underwent their first HSCT in CR2 at our institution between January 2015 and December 2019. <b>Results</b>: For the consolidation (<i>n</i> = 72) and no consolidation groups (<i>n</i> = 63), the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was (17.6% vs. 19.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.54), the 5-year non-relapse mortality rate (NRM) was (9.7% vs. 17.5%; <i>p</i> = 0.20), the 5-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was (72.7% vs. 62.7%; <i>p</i> = 0.15), and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was (81.9% vs. 68.3%; <i>p</i> = 0.08).

"<b>Background</b>: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primarily based on single-arm trials or indirect comparisons with stem cell transplantation. However, no direct head-to-head comparisons of CAR-T therapies have been conducted, largely due to their high cost. To assess their true value, indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) are essential. These comparisons, however, are prone to confounding biases, which necessitate careful adjustments through the identification and measurement of relevant variables. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: This study aims to identify the variables used for adjustment in ITCs of CAR-T therapies for DLBCL and examine the methodologies employed to select them. A rapid literature review was conducted in PubMed in September 2023, focusing on ITCs involving CAR-T therapies for DLBCL. The search was based on keywords categorized into three groups: techniques (ITCs and related terms), drugs (CAR-T therapies), and indication (DLBCL). <b>Results</b>: The rapid literature review identified 21 articles, of which 11 were selected for analysis. Exclusions were made for articles that did not identify confounders, were letters to editors, or addressed conditions other than DLBCL. Among the 11 selected publications, 10 did not clearly specify the methodology used to identify adjustment variables. A total of 25 potential confounders were identified across the studies, with substantial variability in the set of variables used, reflecting a lack of standardization in confounder selection. Commonly identified confounders included the number of prior treatment lines and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), although their inclusion as adjustment variables in ITCs was inconsistent, often due to missing data. <b>Conclusions</b>: While the identified confounders are clinically relevant, the methodologies for selecting them remain unclear, resulting in significant variability across studies. Additionally, key variables commonly considered in health technology assessments (HTAs), such as age, sex, and disease severity, were inconsistently incorporated into ITCs.

"In recent years, due to the increasing life expectancy and the growing popularity of nephron sparing strategies (NSS), more elderly and frail patients are undergoing Robotic-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) for the treatment of localized Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). A Single Port Approach has demonstrated itself to reduce estimated blood loss (EBL), complication rates, and length of stay (LOS). In the present study, we aim to compare perioperative and postoperative outcomes of SP RAPN and Multi Port (MP) RAPN, with a focus on elderly patients. In the study, 293 cN0M0 RCC patients who underwent MP and SP RAPN performed at our institution from 2018 to 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, demographic, patient, and tumor characteristics and perioperative variables were assessed across group A (<65 years old) and group B (≥65 years old) patients, as well as MP and SP cohorts. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were carried out, particularly for elderly patients, to evaluate the impact of selected preoperative and perioperative variables on the risk of 30-day postoperative complications. Clinical and demographic characteristics were similar across the MP and SP cohorts of group A and group B. The SP cohort of both group A and group B demonstrated significantly higher rates of extraperitoneal access (75.9% vs. 26.6% for group A, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and 81.8% vs. 26.2% for group B, <i>p</i> < 0.001), shorter median operative times (186 [142.8-222] min vs. 190 [153-238] min for group A, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and 173.5 [143-228] min vs. 206 [178-237] min for group B, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and shorter median LOS (0 [0-1] days vs. 2 [1-3] days for group A, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and 0 [0,1] days vs. 2 [2-4] days for group B, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, for both groups, an SP approach required significantly longer median ischemia times (21 min [18-31] vs. 20 min [16-24] for group A, <i>p</i> = 0.02 and 24.5 min [20-28] vs. 19.5 min [16-26] for group B, <i>p</i> = 0.03). However, the SP cohort of group B, despite the lower rate of on-clamp procedures (63.4% vs. 90.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.03), demonstrated significantly lower median EBL (50 mL [31-142] vs. 100 mL [50-200], <i>p</i> = 0.03). At multivariate analysis, the SP approach was an independent predictor of lower 30-day postoperative complications (OR: 0.2, 95%CI 0.04-0.9, <i>p</i> = 0.04). In the present study, elderly patients undergoing SP RAPN did not demonstrate higher complication rates, EBL or hospitalization days compared to their younger counterparts.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and is closely linked to the gut microbiota. Identifying reproducible and generalizable microbial signatures holds significant potential for enhancing early detection and advancing treatment for this deadly disease. This study integrated various publicly available case-control datasets to identify microbial signatures for CRC. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were evaluated to characterize differences in gut microbial richness, evenness, and overall composition between CRC patients and healthy controls. Differential abundance analysis was conducted using ANCOM-BC and LEfSe to pinpoint individual taxa that were enriched or depleted in CRC patients. Additionally, sccomp, a Bayesian machine learning method from single-cell analysis, was adapted to provide a more robust validation of compositional differences in individual microbial markers. Gut microbial richness is significantly higher in CRC patients, and overall microbiome composition differs significantly between CRC patients and healthy controls. Several taxa, such as <i>Fusobacterium</i> and <i>Peptostreptococcus</i>, are enriched in CRC patients, while others, including <i>Anaerostipes</i>, are depleted. The microbial signatures identified from the integrated data are reproducible and generalizable, with many aligning with findings from previous studies. Furthermore, the use of sccomp enhanced the precision of individual microbial marker identification. Biologically, the microbial signatures identified from the integrated data improve our understanding of the gut microbiota's role in CRC pathogenesis and may contribute to the development of translational targets and microbiota-based therapies.

"Quercetin, a dietary flavonoid and a widely used supplement, has hepatoprotective properties. Given its urate-lowering effects and epidemiological evidence linking elevated serum urate levels to liver cancer risk, we tested whether quercetin reduces liver cancer risk via modulation of urate levels by bioinformatics methods. We employed drug-target Mendelian randomization using genome-wide association study summary statistics from public databases (e.g., MRC-IEU) to assess genetic associations, and integrated these findings with GEO datasets (such as GSE138709 and GSE179443) and immune infiltration analyses using tools like xCell, TIMER. Our analyses identified <i>ABCG2</i>-mediated urate elevation as a causal risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 1.001, <i>p</i> < 0.01), cholangiocarcinoma (OR = 3.424, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and liver fibrosis (OR = 2.528, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed elevated <i>ABCG2</i> expression in cholangiocarcinoma endothelial cells, while immune infiltration analysis showed significant associations between <i>ABCG2</i> expression and both endothelial cell and macrophage infiltration. Survival analysis further indicated that <i>ABCG2</i> was not associated with poor prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma.

"<b>Background:</b> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and highly lethal form of liver cancer, with limited effective treatment options, particularly in the advanced stages. Immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has emerged as a promising treatment modality, yet a substantial proportion of patients exhibit resistance or fail to respond to such therapies. This study aimed to elucidate the role of G0/G1 Switch 2 (G0S2) in regulating PD-L1 expression in monocytes within the HCC tumor microenvironment and to investigate its impact on the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. <b>Methods:</b> Gene expression data among HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were obtained from the HCC single-cell sequencing database; immunohistochemistry was performed to detect G0S2 expression in liver cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues of HCC patients; flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the expression of G0S2, PD-L1, CD206, and CD14 in PBMCs from HCC patients; and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion were used to evaluate the impact of G0S2 knockdown. <b>Results:</b> Utilizing single-cell sequencing data from HCC patients, we identified that G0S2 expression was significantly elevated in the non-responders (NR) compared to responders (R) to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels of G0S2 in HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues, while the flow cytometry revealed the increased expression of G0S2, PD-L1, and CD206 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from NR patients compared to R patients and healthy controls. The functional experiments involving the knockdown of G0S2 in the THP-1 monocyte cell line resulted in a significant reduction in PD-L1 expression and a concomitant increase in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings indicate that G0S2 facilitates the upregulation of PD-L1 in monocytes, thereby suppressing T cell activity and contributing to resistance against PD-1 inhibitors in HCC. The high expression of G0S2 in peripheral blood monocytes offers a non-invasive and easily detectable biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Consequently, targeting G0S2 may enhance the responsiveness to immunotherapy in HCC patients, providing a new avenue for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",Single-Cell Analysis,bbackgroundb hepatocellular carcinoma hcc prevalent highly lethal form liver cancer limited effective treatment options particularly advanced stages immunotherapy using pd inhibitors emerged promising treatment modality yet substantial proportion patients exhibit resistance fail respond therapies study aimed elucidate role gg switch gs regulating pdl expression monocytes within hcc tumor microenvironment investigate impact efficacy pd inhibitors bmethodsb gene expression data among hcc patients treated pd inhibitors obtained hcc singlecell sequencing database immunohistochemistry performed detect gs expression liver cancer tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues hcc patients flow cytometry utilized analyze expression gs pdl cd cd pbmcs hcc patients cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn secretion used evaluate impact gs knockdown bresultsb utilizing singlecell sequencing data hcc patients identified gs expression significantly elevated nonresponders nr compared responders r pd inhibitor therapy immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels gs hcc tumor tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues flow cytometry revealed increased expression gs pdl cd peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs nr patients compared r patients healthy controls functional experiments involving knockdown gs thp monocyte cell line resulted significant reduction pdl expression concomitant increase cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn production bconclusionsb findings indicate gs facilitates upregulation pdl monocytes thereby suppressing cell activity contributing resistance pd inhibitors hcc high expression gs peripheral blood monocytes offers noninvasive easily detectable biomarker predicting efficacy pd inhibitor therapy consequently targeting gs may enhance responsiveness immunotherapy hcc patients providing new avenue optimizing treatment strategies improving patient outcomes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Dynamic changes in histone acetylation play crucial roles during cellular differentiation and disease development, but their detection in living cells is still a challenging task. Here, we developed a Bimolecular Anchor Detector (BiAD) sensor for the detection of locus-specific changes in histone acetylation in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. We used the BRD9 bromodomain cloned as tandem double domain (2xBRD9-BD) as a reader of histone acetylation. It was integrated into a dual-color BiAD chassis that was previously described by us. We identified the gene body of <i>TTC34</i> as a potential target for our sensor, because it contains dense histone acetylation and 392 local sequence repeats. Using a binding-deficient mutant of 2xBRD9-BD as a negative control, we established a successful readout of histone acetylation at the <i>TTC34</i> locus. A single-domain reader did not function, indicating the requirement for the double reader to enhance the affinity and specificity of the chromatin interaction via avidity effects. With this sensor, we could detect dynamic increases in histone acetylation at the <i>TTC34</i> locus after the treatment of cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A for 6 h indicating the applicability of the sensor for single-cell epigenome studies. Our data demonstrate that active chromatin modifications can be detected by BiAD sensors using 2xBRD9-BD as a reader. This complements the toolkit of the available BiAD sensors and documents the modularity of BiAD sensors.",Single-Cell Analysis,dynamic changes histone acetylation play crucial roles cellular differentiation disease development detection living cells still challenging task developed bimolecular anchor detector biad sensor detection locusspecific changes histone acetylation living cells fluorescence microscopy used brd bromodomain cloned tandem double domain xbrdbd reader histone acetylation integrated dualcolor biad chassis previously described us identified gene body ittci potential target sensor contains dense histone acetylation local sequence repeats using bindingdeficient mutant xbrdbd negative control established successful readout histone acetylation ittci locus singledomain reader function indicating requirement double reader enhance affinity specificity chromatin interaction via avidity effects sensor could detect dynamic increases histone acetylation ittci locus treatment cells histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin h indicating applicability sensor singlecell epigenome studies data demonstrate active chromatin modifications detected biad sensors using xbrdbd reader complements toolkit available biad sensors documents modularity biad sensors,Single-Cell Analysis
"We introduce an innovative, non-invasive prenatal screening approach for detecting fetal monogenic alterations and copy number variations (CNVs) from maternal blood. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted from maternal peripheral blood and processed using the VeriSeq NIPT Solution (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), with shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) performed on a NextSeq550Dx (Illumina). A customized gene panel and bioinformatics tool, named the ""VERA Revolution"", were developed to detect variants and CNVs in cfDNA samples. Results were compared with genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from fetal samples, including amniotic fluid and chorionic villus sampling and buccal swabs. The study included pregnant women with gestational ages from 10 + 3 to 15 + 2 weeks (mean: 12.1 weeks). The fetal fraction (FF), a crucial measure of cfDNA test reliability, ranged from 5% to 20%, ensuring adequate DNA amount for analysis. Among 36 families tested, 14 showed a wild-type genotype.

"<b>Background</b>: ZDHHC19-a protein acyltransferase-is known to be induced in sepsis, a dysregulated immune response to infection, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore whether upregulation of <i>ZDHHC19</i> is modulated by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the binding of microRNA in the 3' untranslated region of the gene. <b>Methods</b>: Inpatients with clinically verified severe infection (<i>n</i> = 83) or sepsis (<i>n</i> = 63) were recruited to the study. Genomic DNA and total RNA were prepared from buccal and peripheral blood samples, respectively. Genotyping of rs112579116 and rs2293161 SNPs was performed by TaqMan real-time PCR assays, while <i>ZDHHC19</i> mRNA as well as miR-4733 and -596 microRNA levels were quantitated by reverse transcription qPCR. Correlations between genotypes, expression levels and clinical parameters were assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney and t-tests. <b>Results</b>: Transcript levels of <i>ZDHHC19</i> were significantly enhanced in septic blood samples (<i>p</i> = 0.0000709) and associated with clinical parameters such as procalcitonin levels, blood cell counts and clotting factors.

"Liver cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, particularly in developing countries, where it poses a significant financial burden. Early detection and timely treatment remain challenging due to the complex mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of liver cancer. This study aims to uncover key genomic features, analyze their functional roles, and propose potential therapeutic drugs identified through molecular docking, utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from liver cancer studies. We applied two advanced hybrid methods known for their robust identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regardless of sample size, along with four top-performing individual methods. These approaches were used to analyze four scRNA-seq datasets, leading to the identification of essential DEGs. Through a protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network, we identified 25 hub-of-hub genes (hHubGs) and 20 additional hHubGs from two naturally occurring gene clusters, ultimately validating a total of 36 hHubGs. Functional, pathway, and survival analyses revealed that these hHubGs are strongly linked to liver cancer. Based on molecular docking and binding-affinity scores with 36 receptor proteins, we proposed 10 potential therapeutic drugs, which we selected from a pool of 300 cancer meta-drugs. The choice of these drugs was further validated using 14 top-ranked published receptor proteins from a set of 42. The proposed candidates include Adozelesin, Tivozanib, NVP-BHG712, Nilotinib, Entrectinib, Irinotecan, Ponatinib, and YM201636.

"Proper cellular function hinges on appropriate subcellular protein localization. When cellular proteins become mislocalized, they can accumulate, cause cellular damage, and disrupt many biochemical and cellular processes. Notably, mislocalized protein accumulation and the resulting cytotoxic effects are salient features of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, and ALS. The detrimental cellular consequences of mislocalized proteins accumulation make it crucial to develop techniques and approaches that counteract this malfunction. Remarkably, a recent study by Ng et al. introduced targeted relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs) as a novel molecular tool for relocalizing endogenous target proteins to counteract disease-associated mislocalized proteins. The authors developed a quantitative single-cell analysis to evaluate the strength and relocalization capability of TRAMs by coupling a target protein and a shuttle protein. Herein, we briefly highlight and discuss the potential molecular implications for targeted protein relocalization as an effective approach for correcting mislocalized proteins.",Single-Cell Analysis,proper cellular function hinges appropriate subcellular protein localization cellular proteins become mislocalized accumulate cause cellular damage disrupt many biochemical cellular processes notably mislocalized protein accumulation resulting cytotoxic effects salient features neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimers parkinsons disease als detrimental cellular consequences mislocalized proteins accumulation make crucial develop techniques approaches counteract malfunction remarkably recent study ng et al introduced targeted relocalizationactivating molecules trams novel molecular tool relocalizing endogenous target proteins counteract diseaseassociated mislocalized proteins authors developed quantitative singlecell analysis evaluate strength relocalization capability trams coupling target protein shuttle protein herein briefly highlight discuss potential molecular implications targeted protein relocalization effective approach correcting mislocalized proteins,Single-Cell Analysis
"A dysregulated nucleotide metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). RNA sequencing datasets, GSE102485, GSE60436, and GSE165784, were downloaded from the GEO database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the DR and controls overlapped with nucleotide metabolism-related genes (NM-RGs), resulting in the differentially expressed NM-RGs (DE-NMRGs). Next, the core genes were identified by the five algorithms of the CytoHubba plugin. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and gene expression analysis were utilized to confirm the biomarkers. Then, the correlations between biomarker expression and the immune-related module were analyzed. The miRNA and transcription factor (TF) predictions, biomarker-targeting drugs, and molecular docking were implemented separately. The interaction between each subcluster of DR was elucidated through single-cell RNA (scRNA) analysis. Moreover, RT-PCR was applied to verify the expression of the biomarkers. In GSE102485, 48 DE-NMRGs were identified via the intersection of 1359 DEGs and 882 NM-RGs. Using the CytoHubba plugin, HMOX1, TLR4, and ACE were selected as core genes. As per the GSVA result, the interferon alpha response, IL6_JAK_STAT3 signaling, and apoptosis were activated in the DR group. The TF prediction identified TLR4 and HMOX1 as potential target genes of USF2.

"Histone modifications play a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining the functionality of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), which are essential for male fertility and spermatogenesis. In this study, we integrated microarray and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to identify key histone modification gene changes associated with SSC function and aging. Through differential expression analysis, we identified 2509 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SSCs compared to fibroblasts. Among these, genes involved in histone modification, such as KDM5B, SCML2, SIN3A, and ASXL3, were highlighted for their significant roles in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed critical biological processes such as chromatin organization, histone demethylation, and chromosome structure maintenance. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) further revealed three key modules of co-expressed genes related to spermatogonial aging. Additionally, ligand-receptor interaction scoring based on tumor microenvironment analysis suggested potential signaling pathways that could influence the stemness and differentiation of SSCs. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SSC aging, highlighting histone modification genes as potential therapeutic targets for preserving male fertility and improving SSC-culturing techniques.

"Programmed cell death (PCD) dynamically influences breast cancer (BC) prognosis through interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME). We investigated 13 PCD patterns to decipher their prognostic impact and mechanistic links to TME-driven outcomes. Our study aimed to explore the complex mechanisms underlying these interactions and establish a prognostic prediction model for breast cancer. Using TCGA and METABRIC datasets, we integrated single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to explore PCD-TME interactions. Multi-dimensional analyses included immune infiltration, genomic heterogeneity, and functional pathway enrichment. Our results indicated that high apoptosis and pyroptosis activity, along with low autophagy, correlated with favorable prognosis, which was driven by enhanced anti-tumor immunity, including more M1 macrophage polarization and activated CD8+ T cells in TME. PCD-related genes could promote tumor metastasis and poor prognosis via VEGF/HIF-1/MAPK signaling and immune response, including Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, while new tumor event occurrences (metastasis/secondary cancers) were linked to specific clinical features and gene mutation spectrums, including TP53/CDH1 mutations and genomic instability. We constructed a six-gene LASSO model (<i>BCAP31</i>, <i>BMF</i>, <i>GLUL</i>, <i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>PARP3</i>, <i>PROM2</i>) to predict prognosis and identify high-risk BC patients (for five-year survival, AUC = 0.76 in TCGA; 0.74 in METABRIC). Therein, the high-risk subtype patients demonstrated a poorer prognosis, also characterized by lower microenvironment matrix and downregulated immunocyte infiltration. These six gene signatures also showed prognostic value with significant differential expression in gene and protein levels of BC samples. Our study provided a comprehensive landscape of the cancer survival difference and related PCD-TME interaction axis and highlighted that high-apoptosis/pyroptosis states caused favorable prognosis, underlying mechanisms closely related with the TME where anti-tumor immunity would be beneficial for patient prognosis.

"The peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) family plays a crucial role in balancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor cells. However, its potential role in prognosis and therapy response of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. In this study, we utilized 2 public single-cell RNA datasets and 8 bulk-RNA datasets to investigate the clinical value of six PRDXs family members in PCa. Expression comparison, biochemical recurrence analysis, and therapy response analysis were measured. Pathway enrichments were utilized to predict the potential down-stream pathway it may involve. In vitro experiments were used to validate the function of PRDX5 in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines. Among the PRDXs family, PRDX5 was most related to the advancement of prostate cancer. A nomogram integrating the expression of PRDX5 with clinical features was developed to better predict clinical outcomes in PCa patients compared to 30 published signatures. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify that PRDX5 expression was higher in advanced levels of PCa tissue. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and pathway predictive analysis revealed that the PRDX5 related genes were mainly relevant to ROS Pathway, Mitochondria-related functions, cellular respiration, and oxidative phosphorylation. In vitro cell proliferation assays, ROS determination assay, and apoptosis assay together revealed that depletion of PRDX5 induces apoptosis via ROS accumulation in CRPC cells. Moreover, the expression of PRDX5 in CRPC cells also affects the sensitivity to the ARSI therapy. This study offers new evidence for determining that the expression of PRDX5 is associated with advanced tumor grade, poor prognosis, and suboptimal response to multiple therapies in PCa within the PRDXs family.

"The triglyceride-glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI), a marker for insulin resistance, is recognized for its predictive role in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including kidney disease. we explored the TyG-BMI index's association with postoperative kidney injury in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients, who are at an elevated risk for such complications, underscoring its potential as a predictor for acute kidney injury (AKI). This single-center, retrospective study included 126 patients. Patients were divided into AKI and non-AKI groups postoperatively according to the KDIGO classification criteria. Univariate logistic regression was used to screen for variables with significant differences (P < 0.01), and multiple multivariate regression models were constructed to analyze independent risk factors in the multivariate regression model and to analyze the value of TyG-BMI in predicting AKI in diabetic patients after CABG. Compared to the non-AKI group, the AKI group had statistically significant differences in preoperative fasting triglycerides, preoperative fasting glucose, preoperative and postoperative creatinine levels, ICU stay duration, and TyG-BMI levels (P < 0.05). Based on the results of univariate regression analysis, a multivariate logistic regression model A was constructed using all significant variables, and a multivariate logistic regression model 2 was constructed using significant variables other than TyG-BMI. ROC analysis showed that model 2 had better predictive performance than model 1 (AUC = 0.836 vs. 0.766). A positive correlation was observed between TyG-BMI and AKI occurrence (Spearman's correlation coefficient: R = 0.33, P = 0.00019). Elevated TyG-BMI levels are closely associated with AKI in diabetic patients after CABG. TyG-BMI has potentially predictive value for AKI in diabetic patients after CABG and may play a crucial role in risk stratification in clinical practice.",Single-Cell Analysis,triglycerideglucosebody mass index tygbmi marker insulin resistance recognized predictive role cardiovascular metabolic diseases including kidney disease explored tygbmi indexs association postoperative kidney injury coronary artery bypass grafting cabg patients elevated risk complications underscoring potential predictor acute kidney injury aki singlecenter retrospective study included patients patients divided aki nonaki groups postoperatively according kdigo classification criteria univariate logistic regression used screen variables significant differences p multiple multivariate regression models constructed analyze independent risk factors multivariate regression model analyze value tygbmi predicting aki diabetic patients cabg compared nonaki group aki group statistically significant differences preoperative fasting triglycerides preoperative fasting glucose preoperative postoperative creatinine levels icu stay duration tygbmi levels p based results univariate regression analysis multivariate logistic regression model constructed using significant variables multivariate logistic regression model constructed using significant variables tygbmi roc analysis showed model better predictive performance model auc vs positive correlation observed tygbmi aki occurrence spearmans correlation coefficient r p elevated tygbmi levels closely associated aki diabetic patients cabg tygbmi potentially predictive value aki diabetic patients cabg may play crucial role risk stratification clinical practice,Single-Cell Analysis
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and multi-organ damage. A central factor in SLE pathogenesis is the excessive production of type I interferon (IFN-I), which drives immune dysregulation. Monocytes, key components of the immune system, significantly contribute to IFN-I production. However, their specific roles in SLE remain incompletely understood. This study utilized bioinformatics and statistical analyses, including robust rank aggregation (RRA), DESeq2, and limma, to analyze transcriptome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes of SLE patients and healthy controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were processed using the Seurat R package to identify and characterize monocyte subsets with a strong IFN-driven gene signature. Flow cytometry was employed to validate key findings, using markers such as CD14, SIGLEC1, and IRF7 to confirm monocyte subset composition. Our research has found that monocytes in SLE undergo IFN-driven transcriptional reprogramming, with the upregulation of key interferon signature genes (ISGs), forming the SLE-Related Monocyte Signature (SLERRAsignature). Moreover, the composition of mononuclear phagocyte subsets in SLE patients changes, with an increase trend in the proportion of the CD14Mono8 subset in the flare group. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 13 mononuclear phagocyte subsets of SLE are mainly ISGs, and the expression of ISGs is higher in severe patients. We identified SIGLEC1<sup>+</sup>IRF7<sup>+</sup> monocytes among these subsets and for the first time discovered this group of cells in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. In SLE, the enrichment score of the gene set representing SIGLEC1<sup>+</sup>IRF7<sup>+</sup> monocytes is positively correlated with the severity of SLE. Finally, flow cytometry confirmed that the frequency of CD14<sup>+</sup>SIGLEC1<sup>+</sup>IRF7<sup>+</sup> monocytes in PBMCs was higher in SLE compared with healthy controls. Our study found that the expansion of IFN-I-producing monocyte subsets, particularly the CD14<sup>+</sup>SIGLEC1<sup>+</sup>IRF7<sup>+</sup> subset, plays a crucial role in SLE pathogenesis.

"Clinical trials have shown that neoadjuvant anlotinib combined with PD-1 blockade therapy can prolong the survival of patients with driver gene negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but some patients fail to benefit from the combination therapy. To explore the potential drug resistance mechanism and predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in NSCLC patients, we used scRNA-seq to observe and analyze the dynamic changes of immune cells, stromal cells and cancer cells in NSCLC patients who received neoadjuvant combination therapy. We analyzed transcriptome data of ~ 47,000 single cells from 9 NSCLC patients, including 3 treatment naïve patients, 3 post-treatment patients with major pathological response (MPR), and 3 Non-MPR patients. Subsequently, the infiltration of immune cells was detected by immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence in NSCLC. In MPR patients, we found that neoadjuvant therapy reduced the expression of the T cell exhausted signature, reduced the transition of T_THEMIS cells to Tregs, and enhanced the positive feedback between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and PAX5<sup>+</sup> memory B cells. In Non-MPR patients, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dampen therapeutic efficiency by being the hub of cell communication. TAMs and fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via VEGF, endothelial ZEB1 may up-regulate FLT1 (VEGFR) expression in response to anlotinib, and VEGFR<sup>+</sup> endothelial cell signature can predict survival of NSCLC cohort in TCGA. In addition, PLA2G4A, the key enzyme in the VEGF pathway, was highly expressed in the tumor cells of Non-MPR patients after anlotinib treatment. In 135 NSCLC patients, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that PLA2G4A was positively correlated with poor prognosis and Tregs infiltration. In conclusion, VEGF signaling dependent dynamic changes in endothelial and epithelial cells are deeply involved in the formation of anlotinib resistance and immunosuppression phenotypes in NSCLC patients.",Single-Cell Analysis,clinical trials shown neoadjuvant anlotinib combined pd blockade therapy prolong survival patients driver gene negative nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc patients fail benefit combination therapy explore potential drug resistance mechanism predict efficacy neoadjuvant therapy nsclc patients used scrnaseq observe analyze dynamic changes immune cells stromal cells cancer cells nsclc patients received neoadjuvant combination therapy analyzed transcriptome data single cells nsclc patients including treatment nave patients posttreatment patients major pathological response mpr nonmpr patients subsequently infiltration immune cells detected immunohistochemistry multiplex immunofluorescence nsclc mpr patients found neoadjuvant therapy reduced expression cell exhausted signature reduced transition tthemis cells tregs enhanced positive feedback cdsupsup cells paxsupsup memory b cells nonmpr patients tumorassociated macrophages tams dampen therapeutic efficiency hub cell communication tams fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via vegf endothelial zeb may upregulate flt vegfr expression response anlotinib vegfrsupsup endothelial cell signature predict survival nsclc cohort tcga addition plaga key enzyme vegf pathway highly expressed tumor cells nonmpr patients anlotinib treatment nsclc patients confirmed immunohistochemistry plaga positively correlated poor prognosis tregs infiltration conclusion vegf signaling dependent dynamic changes endothelial epithelial cells deeply involved formation anlotinib resistance immunosuppression phenotypes nsclc patients,Single-Cell Analysis
"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignancies, characterized by high heterogeneity and poor outcomes. Effective classification for patient stratification and identifying reliable markers for prognosis prediction and treatment choice are crucial. Integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq analyses were used to characterize ESCC. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering was performed to stratify the ESCC patients into different subtypes and the clinical and pathological features of the ESCC subtypes were compared. Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were used to select key genes and construct a risk model for ESCC. The associations of the key genes with anti-cancer drug sensitivities in ESCC cell lines were investigated. RT-qRCR experiments, proteomics analysis, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) experiments were used to validate the results. Furthermore, one identified gene was selected to investigate its correlation with EGFR expression and the gene effect scores of various potential gene targets across pan-cancer. The study identified the dysregulated distributions of epithelial cells and fibroblasts as characteristic of ESCC. ESCC patients could be classified into four distinct subtypes with unique cell type features and prognoses. With the gene makers of the cell type features, a four-gene prognostic signature for ESCC was constructed. The CCND1-PKP1-JUP-ANKRD12 model could effectively discriminate the survival status of ESCC patients, independent of various pathological and clinical features. The risk score for the samples was correlated with the expression levels of immunoregulatory genes. The prognostic effects of CCND1, PKP1, and JUP were confirmed at the protein level. The phosphorylation levels of PKP1, JUP, and ANKRD12 were found to be dysregulated in ESCC tumors. Their expression dysregulation and heterogeneity were demonstrated in ESCC cell lines. All four genes were significantly correlated with at least one of the anti-cancer drug sensitivities in ESCC cell lines. PKP1 expression was significantly correlated with EGFR expression and gene effect scores in multiple cancers. We conclude that the CCND1-PKP1-JUP-ANKRD12 signature may serve as a novel indicator for ESCC prognosis and diagnosis. PKP1 expression might provide new clues for gene therapy efficacy in multiple cancers.",Single-Cell Analysis,esophageal squamous cell carcinoma escc one common malignancies characterized high heterogeneity poor outcomes effective classification patient stratification identifying reliable markers prognosis prediction treatment choice crucial integration singlecell rnasequencing rnaseq bulk rnaseq analyses used characterize escc nonnegative matrix factorization nmf clustering performed stratify escc patients different subtypes clinical pathological features escc subtypes compared cox regression analysis lasso regression analysis used select key genes construct risk model escc associations key genes anticancer drug sensitivities escc cell lines investigated rtqrcr experiments proteomics analysis multiplex immunohistochemistry mihc experiments used validate results furthermore one identified gene selected investigate correlation egfr expression gene effect scores various potential gene targets across pancancer study identified dysregulated distributions epithelial cells fibroblasts characteristic escc escc patients could classified four distinct subtypes unique cell type features prognoses gene makers cell type features fourgene prognostic signature escc constructed ccndpkpjupankrd model could effectively discriminate survival status escc patients independent various pathological clinical features risk score samples correlated expression levels immunoregulatory genes prognostic effects ccnd pkp jup confirmed protein level phosphorylation levels pkp jup ankrd found dysregulated escc tumors expression dysregulation heterogeneity demonstrated escc cell lines four genes significantly correlated least one anticancer drug sensitivities escc cell lines pkp expression significantly correlated egfr expression gene effect scores multiple cancers conclude ccndpkpjupankrd signature may serve novel indicator escc prognosis diagnosis pkp expression might provide new clues gene therapy efficacy multiple cancers,Single-Cell Analysis
"With the development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, scRNA-seq data analysis suffers huge challenges due to large scale, high dimensionality, high noise, and high sparsity. To achieve accurately embedded representation in the large-scale scRNA-seq data, we try to design a novel graph convolutional network with an adaptive aggregation mechanism. Based on the assumption that the aggregation order of different cells would be different, a graph convolutional network with an adaptive aggregation-based dimensionality reduction algorithm for scRNA-seq data is developed, named scAGCN. In scAGCN, a preprocessing consisting of quality control and feature selection is implemented. Then, an approximate nearest neighbor graph is rapidly constructed. Finally, a graph convolutional network with an adaptive aggregation mechanism is constructed, in which the neighborhood selection strategy based on node distribution and similarity boxplots is designed, and the aggregation function is optimized by defining a similarity measurement between neighborhood nodes and the central node. The results show that scAGCN outperforms existing dimensionality reduction methods on 15 real scRNA-seq datasets, especially in 10 large-scale scRNA-seq datasets.",Single-Cell Analysis,development singlecell rnasequencing scrnaseq technology scrnaseq data analysis suffers huge challenges due large scale high dimensionality high noise high sparsity achieve accurately embedded representation largescale scrnaseq data try design novel graph convolutional network adaptive aggregation mechanism based assumption aggregation order different cells would different graph convolutional network adaptive aggregationbased dimensionality reduction algorithm scrnaseq data developed named scagcn scagcn preprocessing consisting quality control feature selection implemented approximate nearest neighbor graph rapidly constructed finally graph convolutional network adaptive aggregation mechanism constructed neighborhood selection strategy based node distribution similarity boxplots designed aggregation function optimized defining similarity measurement neighborhood nodes central node results show scagcn outperforms existing dimensionality reduction methods real scrnaseq datasets especially largescale scrnaseq datasets,Single-Cell Analysis
"Hepatocytes are organized along a spatial axis between the portal triad and the central vein to form functionally repetitive units known as lobules. The hepatocytes perform distinct metabolic functions depending on their location within the lobule. Single-cell analysis of hepatocytes across the liver lobule demonstrates that gluconeogenic gene expression is relatively low in the fed state and gradually increases in the periportal hepatocytes during the initial fasting period. As fasting progresses, pericentral hepatocyte gluconeogenic gene expression and gluconeogenic activity also increase and, following entry into a starvation state, the pericentral hepatocytes show similar gluconeogenic gene expression and activity to the periportal hepatocytes. In parallel, starvation suppresses canonical β-catenin signalling and modulates the expression of pericentral and periportal glutamine synthetase and glutaminase, respectively, resulting in enhanced incorporation of glutamine into glucose. Thus, hepatocyte gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production are spatially and temporally plastic across the liver lobule, underscoring the complexity of defining hepatic insulin resistance and glucose production on a whole-organ level, as well as for a particular fasted or fed condition.",Single-Cell Analysis,hepatocytes organized along spatial axis portal triad central vein form functionally repetitive units known lobules hepatocytes perform distinct metabolic functions depending location within lobule singlecell analysis hepatocytes across liver lobule demonstrates gluconeogenic gene expression relatively low fed state gradually increases periportal hepatocytes initial fasting period fasting progresses pericentral hepatocyte gluconeogenic gene expression gluconeogenic activity also increase following entry starvation state pericentral hepatocytes show similar gluconeogenic gene expression activity periportal hepatocytes parallel starvation suppresses canonical catenin signalling modulates expression pericentral periportal glutamine synthetase glutaminase respectively resulting enhanced incorporation glutamine glucose thus hepatocyte gluconeogenic gene expression glucose production spatially temporally plastic across liver lobule underscoring complexity defining hepatic insulin resistance glucose production wholeorgan level well particular fasted fed condition,Single-Cell Analysis
"The rapid evolution of single-cell sequencing technologies has significantly advanced our knowledge of cellular heterogeneity and the underlying molecular basis in healthy and diseased kidneys. While single-cell transcriptomic analysis excels in characterizing cell states in the heterogeneous population, the complex regulatory mechanisms governing the gene expressions are difficult to decipher using transcriptomic data alone. Single-cell sequencing technology has recently extended to include epigenome and other modalities, allowing single-cell multiomics analysis. Especially, the integrative analysis of epigenome and transcriptome dissects the cell-specific, gene-regulatory mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity. An increasing number of single-cell multimodal atlases are being generated in nephrology research, offering novel insights into cellular diversity and the underpinning epigenetic regulation. This ongoing paradigm shift in kidney research accelerates the identification of new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets, promoting clinical translation.

"Coenzyme Q10 (Q10) plays a critical role in cellular energy conversion within the mitochondrial respiratory chain and offers protective effects against oxidative and metabolic stress. In this study, we investigated the impact of Q10 on the spatio-temporal patterns of cellular energetics in keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, utilizing the genetically-encoded FRET sensor AMPfret. Engineered from the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), this sensor leverages endogenous affinities of the kinase that evolved to detect energy stress, specifically decreases in ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP ratios that pose a threat to cell survival. We successfully established HaCaT cells stably expressing AMPfret, validated their functionality by inducing energy stress with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and demonstrated that Q10, together with high glucose conditions in culture, can enhance cellular energetics compared to low glucose controls. We then employed AMPfret to analyze the spatio-temporal response of HaCaT keratinocytes to Luperox (tert-butyl peroxide), a potent organic prooxidant, in the presence of varying intracellular levels of Q10. Preloading cells with Q10 was protective, slowing the speed and reducing the extend of the energy stress response. In contrast, preincubation with Simvastatin, an inhibitor of the mevalonate Q10 biosynthesis pathway, depleted cellular Q10 levels, accelerated the onset of energy stress, and led to early cell death as compared to controls. Under all conditions, AMPfret revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in energy stress at baseline and in the response to Luperox. Overall, tracking changes in energy state in time and at single-cell level allows further insights into the beneficial role of Q10 in enhancing cellular bioenergetics in skin cells, and a potential role of AMPK in mediating responses to altered Q10 levels.",Single-Cell Analysis,coenzyme q q plays critical role cellular energy conversion within mitochondrial respiratory chain offers protective effects oxidative metabolic stress study investigated impact q spatiotemporal patterns cellular energetics keratinocytederived hacat cells utilizing geneticallyencoded fret sensor ampfret engineered ampactivated protein kinase ampk sensor leverages endogenous affinities kinase evolved detect energy stress specifically decreases atpadp atpamp ratios pose threat cell survival successfully established hacat cells stably expressing ampfret validated functionality inducing energy stress deoxydglucose demonstrated q together high glucose conditions culture enhance cellular energetics compared low glucose controls employed ampfret analyze spatiotemporal response hacat keratinocytes luperox tertbutyl peroxide potent organic prooxidant presence varying intracellular levels q preloading cells q protective slowing speed reducing extend energy stress response contrast preincubation simvastatin inhibitor mevalonate q biosynthesis pathway depleted cellular q levels accelerated onset energy stress led early cell death compared controls conditions ampfret revealed celltocell heterogeneity energy stress baseline response luperox overall tracking changes energy state time singlecell level allows insights beneficial role q enhancing cellular bioenergetics skin cells potential role ampk mediating responses altered q levels,Single-Cell Analysis
"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) manipulates the host immune system to establish a persistent colonization, posing a serious threat to human health, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we integrate single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR profiling for analyzing 187,192 cells from 11 H. pylori-negative and 12 H. pylori-positive individuals to describe the human gastric ecosystem reprogrammed by H. pylori infection, as manifested by impaired antigen presentation and phagocytosis function.

"The improvement of the prediction of prostate cancer (PCa) is a major challenge in disease management. This study analysed a total of 147,856 cells and identified 15 distinct cell types using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data from TCGA and GEO databases. Of these cells, 31,256 exhibited a high telomere-related gene score and were predominantly composed of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). Simultaneously, pseudo-temporal analysis indicated that mDCs are in the later stages of the differentiation trajectory, suggesting the significant role of mDCs as telomere-active cells in the development of PCa. Analysis of cell-cell communication revealed significant differences, particularly an increase in communication between mDCs and CTLs, alongside a decrease in communication between mDCs and B cells. These variations may represent critical nodes influencing the development of PCa. Additionally, two hub genes were utilized to create risk models, with ROC curves confirming their predictive efficacy for 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates in patients. Functional analysis of these genes was conducted, and NPY siRNA transfection notably inhibited proliferation in LNCaP and DU145 cells.

"The interaction between tumor-derived exosomes and stroma plays a crucial role in tumor progression. However, the mechanisms through which tumor cells influence stromal changes are not yet fully understood. In our study, through single-cell sequencing analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues at varying stages of progression, we determined that the proportion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in advanced renal cell carcinoma tissues was notably higher compared to localized renal cell carcinoma tissues. Comparison of transcriptome sequencing and energy metabolism tests between CAFs primarily isolated from advanced renal cell carcinoma tissues and normal fibroblasts (NFs) revealed the occurrence of the Warburg effect during the fibroblast activation process. Additionally, we observed an increase in glucose transporter GLUT1 expression, total reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lactic acid production, and subsequent excretion of excess lactic acid through monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4) in CAFs. Interestingly, renal cancer cells were found to uptake lactic acid via MCT1 upon interaction with CAFs, thereby enhancing their malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, the down-regulation of PANK3 induced by exosomes derived from renal cancer cells was identified as a crucial step in fibroblast activation. These findings indicate that exosomes play a role in facilitating intercellular communication between renal cancer cells and fibroblasts. Targeting this communication pathway could potentially offer new strategies for the prevention and treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.",Single-Cell Analysis,interaction tumorderived exosomes stroma plays crucial role tumor progression however mechanisms tumor cells influence stromal changes yet fully understood study singlecell sequencing analysis clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues varying stages progression determined proportion cancerassociated fibroblasts cafs advanced renal cell carcinoma tissues notably higher compared localized renal cell carcinoma tissues comparison transcriptome sequencing energy metabolism tests cafs primarily isolated advanced renal cell carcinoma tissues normal fibroblasts nfs revealed occurrence warburg effect fibroblast activation process additionally observed increase glucose transporter glut expression total reactive oxygen species ros levels lactic acid production subsequent excretion excess lactic acid monocarboxylate transporter mct cafs interestingly renal cancer cells found uptake lactic acid via mct upon interaction cafs thereby enhancing malignant phenotypes furthermore downregulation pank induced exosomes derived renal cancer cells identified crucial step fibroblast activation findings indicate exosomes play role facilitating intercellular communication renal cancer cells fibroblasts targeting communication pathway could potentially offer new strategies prevention treatment advanced renal cell carcinoma,Single-Cell Analysis
"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (Chemo-IM) is associated with significantly improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates and long-term survival outcomes in patient with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, only a small proportion of patients benefit from the addition of immunotherapy. Here, we explored and confirmed the role of intratumoral microbiota in screening patients with TNBC who are likely to benefit from neoadjuvant Chemo-IM. Patients with previously untreated, non-metastatic TNBC receiving neoadjuvant Chemo-IM were enrolled. Differences in the intratumoral microbiota between the pCR and non-pCR groups were explored via 16S rDNA sequencing (16S-seq). Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to profile the tumor microenvironment (TME). Moreover, correlations between the intratumor microbiota and the TME were explored. Finally, machine-learning models based on the intratumoral microbiota were constructed to predict pCR. A total of 89 female patients with early-stage TNBC treated by neoadjuvant Chemo-IM were enrolled. We found that the pCR group had greater diversity and a higher load of intratumoral microbiota than the non-pCR group. Intriguingly, scRNA-seq revealed significantly increased T cell infiltration and decreased tumor-associated macrophage infiltration into tumors in the pCR group. Moreover, intratumoral microbiota load was positively associated with CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCL13<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and negatively associated with CD68<sup>+</sup>SPP1<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration. Combined analysis of 16S-seq and scRNA-seq data revealed that intratumoral microbiota were present in both cancer and immune cells. Finally, we developed a model incorporating intratumoral microbiota and clinicopathological characteristics, and it showed strong power for predicting pCR to neoadjuvant Chemo-IM. Intratumoral microbiota may serve as a strong and specific predictor of the response of patients with early-stage TNBC to neoadjuvant Chemo-IM.

"Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is a severe form of male infertility, yet its underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify key regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and hub genes associated with NOA through an integrative bioinformatics approach. Using microarray analysis, we examined 4956 ncRNAs and identified 29 differentially expressed ncRNAs (14 upregulated, 15 downregulated) in NOA compared to healthy individuals. Co-expression analysis revealed significant interactions between lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, predicting 31 target mRNAs within the regulatory network. Further, single-cell transcriptomic analysis identified four pivotal hub genes in NOA Sertoli cells: CLTC, XIAP, and DHFR (upregulated) and STMN1 (downregulated). Functional enrichment analysis highlighted critical pathways, including mitotic spindle organization and phosphatase activity, suggesting their involvement in NOA pathophysiology.

"Erianin is a biphenyl compound with low toxicity and a single structure that is extracted from Dendrobium officinale. The wide spectrum of pharmacological properties and excellent toxicity of erianin have been comprehensively proven in multiple tumors. However, less is known about the toxicity of erianin in acute myeloid leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia AML). Here, we explored the anti-AML capacity and potential mechanisms of erianin. Cells proliferation and cytotoxicity of AML cells of erianin was detected by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometer was conducted to assess AML cells apoptosis rate. Erianin blocked the AML cells cycle at the G2/M phase by regulating cell cycle-related protein and P21, P27, and P53 mRNA expression. Additionally, we first filtered PPARɑ and PIK3R1 through network pharmacology, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and confirmed their binding with erianin by molecular docking analysis.The cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and the drug affinity responsive target stability assay (DARTS) further verified that PPARɑ was an effective target of erianin. Specifically, erianin was found to inhibit the transcriptional level of PIK3R1 by promoting the protein expression of PPARɑ, thereby inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway. The inhibitory effect of erianin was partially neutralized by GW6471, a PPARɑ inhibitor. Notably, erianin revealed vigoroso coordinate repression with LY294002 on AML cells. Our findings indicate that erianin showed a potent cytotoxic effect on AML cells and affected AML cells via PPARɑ to regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. We demonstrated the potent anti-AML effects of erianin and reported its potential mechanisms of action, indicating its potential for further development as a novel anti-AML drug.",Single-Cell Analysis,erianin biphenyl compound low toxicity single structure extracted dendrobium officinale wide spectrum pharmacological properties excellent toxicity erianin comprehensively proven multiple tumors however less known toxicity erianin acute myeloid leukemia acute myeloid leukemia aml explored antiaml capacity potential mechanisms erianin cells proliferation cytotoxicity aml cells erianin detected cck assay flow cytometer conducted assess aml cells apoptosis rate erianin blocked aml cells cycle gm phase regulating cell cyclerelated protein p p p mrna expression additionally first filtered ppar pikr network pharmacology proteinprotein interaction ppi network go kegg pathway enrichment analysis confirmed binding erianin molecular docking analysisthe cellular thermal shift assay cetsa drug affinity responsive target stability assay darts verified ppar effective target erianin specifically erianin found inhibit transcriptional level pikr promoting protein expression ppar thereby inhibiting pikakt pathway inhibitory effect erianin partially neutralized gw ppar inhibitor notably erianin revealed vigoroso coordinate repression ly aml cells findings indicate erianin showed potent cytotoxic effect aml cells affected aml cells via ppar regulate pikakt signaling pathways demonstrated potent antiaml effects erianin reported potential mechanisms action indicating potential development novel antiaml drug,Single-Cell Analysis
"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants posing potential health risks. PAH4 (sum of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), chrysene, benz[a]anthracene and benzo[b]fluoranthene) has been proposed as a marker to evaluate the occurrence of total PAHs. However, toxicity effects of exposure to PAH4 mixture and its toxicity differences with single PAH are little-known. Here, we systematically investigated the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of PAH4 and compare its toxicity with BaP using HepG2 cell model. Our results showed that BaP and PAH4 exposure induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Furthermore, both BaP and PAH4 activated P53 signaling pathway, leading to cell apoptosis, and disrupted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling and induced lipid metabolism disorder. Integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics indicated that BaP and PAH4 shared similar toxicity mechanisms, commonly affecting the metabolic pathways including glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Moreover, the integrated biomarker response (IBR) analysis demonstrated that BaP and PAH4 exhibited similar global toxicity on HepG2 cells. We further found that the toxicity effects of PAH4 could be partially alleviated by an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonist, indicating a potential role of AHR signaling in PAH4-induced hepatotoxicity.

"Arbutin (ARB), a natural polyphenol isolated from the bearberry plant Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, has been studied for its diverse pharmacological activities including anti-diabetic, cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to evaluate arbutin's diuretic activity, focusing on its impact on aldosterone synthase gene expression and its toxicity profile. Acute toxicity was assessed using single doses ranging from 500 to 9000 mg/kg and sub-acute toxicity with doses of 375 and 750 mg/kg over 14 days. To evaluate acute diuretic activity, ARB was administered in three doses (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg i.p) alongside standard groups, furosemide (FUR) 10 mg/kg i.p and Spironolactone (SPIR) 25 mg/kg i.p. In sub-acute diuretic study, treatment was administered for seven days, followed by blood collection and adrenal dissection for gene expression analysis. Acute toxicity studies revealed that ARB is well-tolerated up to 8000 mg/kg with no significant changes in organ and body weight. However, sub-acute studies showed minor changes in leukocyte count, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglycerides (TGs) at high doses while histopathological evaluations revealed no severe organ damage. The diuretic index and electrolyte analysis confirmed the potential of ARB as diuretic and saluretic with reduced risk of hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia. Gene expression studies showed non-selective downregulation of aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) and 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). While the effects on 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) were less pronounced than SPIR, indicating fewer possible anti-androgenic effects.

"Type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (T2 CRSwNP) is often associated with severe symptoms and polyp recurrence. Machine learning (ML) framework of biomarkers derived from non-invasive samples have been less evaluated as tools for describing T2 CRSwNP. To systematically assess the predictive value of protein expression in nasal fluids (NFs) and serum for T2 CRSwNP. T2 and non-T2 CRSwNP were classified using clustering analysis of tissue biomarkers from 82 patients. The expression of 92 inflammation-related proteins was measured in NFs and serum samples from the matched patients using proximity extension assays. ML with 5-fold cross-validation was employed to develop a diagnostic model for T2 CRSwNP. Selected biomarkers were further validated using immunohistochemistry (IHC), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and RT-qPCR. After defining the T2 and non-T2 CRSwNP groups, we identified 23 dysregulated proteins in NFs and 16 in serum. Four biomarkers-Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-4 (MCP-4), Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGFB1), and Cystatin D (CST5)-were selected using Lasso regression to predict T2 CRSwNP based on NFs alone. Their expression was validated through IHC, scRNA-seq, and RT-qPCR. The predictive model achieved area under the curve values (AUC) of 0.91 for the training, 0.91 for the testing, and 0.92 for the validation datasets.

"Therapeutic options for patients with advanced germ-cell tumors (GCTs) after multiple relapses or resistant disease are limited. Olaparib is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. In this proof-of principle open-label, single-arm, phase II trial of olaparib 300 mg twice daily in patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic germ-cell cancer [IGG-02 study (NCT02533765)], patient eligibility included failure after high-dose chemotherapy or after at least two different cisplatin-based regimens. Between September 2015 and February 2019, 18 patients, with a median age of 39 years (range 22-61 years) were enrolled. Severe adverse events (AEs) were observed in seven patients. There were no partial responses, five cases (27.8%) with stable disease (SD) lasting 3, 4, 4, 7 and 43 months, and 13 (72.2%) progressive disease.

"Vascular tissue is crucial for the transport of substances and physical support in most plants. Vascular development in roots encompasses cell proliferation, pattern formation, cell specification, and differentiation. In the roots, the positions and timing of cell proliferation and the differentiation of xylem and phloem cells are strictly controlled in order to achieve continuous vascular transport. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vascular development, with a particular focus on the modulators of each of the above aspects in Arabidopsis roots. In particular, recent technological advances such as genome editing technology and single-cell analysis have led to the discovery of important genes that control vascular development. This paper shows that factors such as hormones, peptides, transcription factors, and microRNAs interact in a multilayered manner to modulate key regulators of root vascular development, ensuring stable vascular formation.",Single-Cell Analysis,vascular tissue crucial transport substances physical support plants vascular development roots encompasses cell proliferation pattern formation cell specification differentiation roots positions timing cell proliferation differentiation xylem phloem cells strictly controlled order achieve continuous vascular transport review describes recent advances understanding molecular mechanisms vascular development particular focus modulators aspects arabidopsis roots particular recent technological advances genome editing technology singlecell analysis led discovery important genes control vascular development paper shows factors hormones peptides transcription factors micrornas interact multilayered manner modulate key regulators root vascular development ensuring stable vascular formation,Single-Cell Analysis
"Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has a dismal prognosis. Despite initial responsiveness to first-line platinum-etoposide chemotherapy, most patients relapse within six months. Managing disease progression, particularly in platinum-resistant or refractory cases, remains challenging. Topotecan is the only drug approved in the European Union for the second-line treatment of SCLC but is associated with modest clinical activity and high rates of hematological toxicities. Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, has been investigated as a viable alternative for treating relapsed SCLC. This study presents the largest real-world cohort of SCLC-patients treated with temozolomide. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with relapsed SCLC treated with temozolomide at a single academic hospital in Belgium. Temozolomide was administered at a fixed dose of 250 mg orally once daily on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle. Data on activity (overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS)) and safety (treatment related adverse events (TRAE)) were collected. Between February 2011 and May 2023, a total of 48 patients with relapsed SCLC were treated with temozolomide of which 47 patients, median age 61 years, were included in this real-world analysis. The majority of the patients were heavily pretreated with 57.4 % having received two or more prior systemic therapies. An objective response was observed in 14.9 % and the DCR was 23.4 %. The median PFS was 1.7 months (95 % CI 1.5-1.9) and the median OS was 3.2 months (95 % CI 2.3-4.1). Grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 34 % of the patients. Temozolomide demonstrated modest clinical activity in this real-world effectiveness analysis of patients with relapsed SCLC. Nevertheless, given its comparable response rate and milder toxicity profile compared to topotecan, temozolomide should be considered as a viable alternative to topotecan for treating relapsed SCLC.",Single-Cell Analysis,extensivestage small cell lung cancer sclc dismal prognosis despite initial responsiveness firstline platinumetoposide chemotherapy patients relapse within six months managing disease progression particularly platinumresistant refractory cases remains challenging topotecan drug approved european union secondline treatment sclc associated modest clinical activity high rates hematological toxicities temozolomide oral alkylating agent investigated viable alternative treating relapsed sclc study presents largest realworld cohort sclcpatients treated temozolomide performed retrospective analysis patients relapsed sclc treated temozolomide single academic hospital belgium temozolomide administered fixed dose mg orally daily days day cycle data activity overall response rate orr disease control rate dcr median progressionfree survival mpfs median overall survival mos safety treatment related adverse events trae collected february may total patients relapsed sclc treated temozolomide patients median age years included realworld analysis majority patients heavily pretreated received two prior systemic therapies objective response observed dcr median pfs months ci median os months ci grade traes occurred patients temozolomide demonstrated modest clinical activity realworld effectiveness analysis patients relapsed sclc nevertheless given comparable response rate milder toxicity profile compared topotecan temozolomide considered viable alternative topotecan treating relapsed sclc,Single-Cell Analysis
"Bisphenol S (BPS) has become extensively used in the manufacturing of consumer products. BPS mainly enters the body through food and water, with oral exposure targeting the gastrointestinal tract. However, its safety profile remains contentious and warrants further investigation. In this study, we aimed to assess whether BPS exerts harmful effects on the body in the absence of overt pathological damage. Our results revealed that although BPS did not lead to significant histopathological damage, it induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. Additionally, in vitro investigations utilizing NCM460 cells and human-derived colorectal organoids demonstrated that BPS exposure induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in intestinal endocrine cells (EECs), upregulating the expression of inflammatory mediators TNF-α and CXCL10. Using a DSS-induced colitis mouse model, it was found that BPS exposure exacerbates the progression of intestinal inflammatory diseases. Analysis of single-cell databases demonstrated a significant reduction in the expression of CHGA, a functional protein of enteroendocrine cells (EECs), in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The expression of CHGA showed a significant negative correlation with the expression of IL17. Notably, supplementation with 3-Indoleglyoxylic acid effectively mitigates the intestinal damage induced by BPS. These findings highlight the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress and IL-17/CXCL10/TNF-α signaling in BPS-induced intestinal damage and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 3-Indoleglyoxylic acid in mitigating these effects.",Single-Cell Analysis,bisphenol bps become extensively used manufacturing consumer products bps mainly enters body food water oral exposure targeting gastrointestinal tract however safety profile remains contentious warrants investigation study aimed assess whether bps exerts harmful effects body absence overt pathological damage results revealed although bps lead significant histopathological damage induced intestinal barrier dysfunction additionally vitro investigations utilizing ncm cells humanderived colorectal organoids demonstrated bps exposure induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ros levels intestinal endocrine cells eecs upregulating expression inflammatory mediators tnf cxcl using dssinduced colitis mouse model found bps exposure exacerbates progression intestinal inflammatory diseases analysis singlecell databases demonstrated significant reduction expression chga functional protein enteroendocrine cells eecs patients inflammatory bowel disease ibd expression chga showed significant negative correlation expression il notably supplementation indoleglyoxylic acid effectively mitigates intestinal damage induced bps findings highlight role mitochondrial oxidative stress ilcxcltnf signaling bpsinduced intestinal damage demonstrate therapeutic potential indoleglyoxylic acid mitigating effects,Single-Cell Analysis
"The role of electron microscopy (EM) in the diagnosis of kidney allograft pathologies, particularly immunologic injury has not been well studied. In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we examined EM features in 796 biopsies from 623 patients at high risk for antibody-mediated rejection, with glomerular abnormalities in light microscopy, presence of donor-specific antibody (DSA), or any degree of albuminuria/proteinuria. Glomerular endothelial cell enlargement (GECE) > 50% was present in 29.1%, subendothelial expansion/basement membrane duplication in 24.5%, and peritubular basement membrane multilamellation > 4 (PTCML) in 18.5%. There was an incremental odds of worsening GECE from no DSA to class I DSA (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-4.5), class II DSA (OR, 3.44, P < 0.001, 95% CI, 2.5-4.7) and both classes (OR, 6.3, P < 0.001; 95% CI, 4.1-9.8). Moreover, the increase in number of antibodies was predictive of higher likelihood of worsening GECE (OR, 2.81, P < 0.001; 95% CI, 2.1-3.8 for 1 DSA; OR, 5.29, P < 0.001; 95% CI, 3.5-7.9 for 2-3; and OR, 8.45, P < 0.001; 95% CI, 4.7-15.3 for ≥4).

"Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, reveals context-dependent phenotypes across multiple biological length scales. Despite its mechanistic importance, identifying and characterizing senescence across cell populations is challenging. Using primary dermal fibroblasts, we combined single-cell imaging, machine learning, several induced senescence conditions, and multiple protein biomarkers to define functional senescence subtypes. Single-cell morphology analysis revealed 11 distinct morphology clusters. Among these, we identified three as bona fide senescence subtypes (C7, C10, and C11), with C10 exhibiting the strongest age dependence within an aging cohort. In addition, we observed that a donor's senescence burden and subtype composition were indicative of susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced senescence. Functional analysis revealed subtype-dependent responses to senotherapies, with C7 being most responsive to the combination of dasatinib and quercetin. Our single-cell analysis framework, SenSCOUT, enables robust identification and classification of senescence subtypes, offering applications in next-generation senotherapy screens, with potential toward explaining heterogeneous senescence phenotypes based on the presence of senescence subtypes.",Single-Cell Analysis,cellular senescence hallmark aging reveals contextdependent phenotypes across multiple biological length scales despite mechanistic importance identifying characterizing senescence across cell populations challenging using primary dermal fibroblasts combined singlecell imaging machine learning several induced senescence conditions multiple protein biomarkers define functional senescence subtypes singlecell morphology analysis revealed distinct morphology clusters among identified three bona fide senescence subtypes c c c c exhibiting strongest age dependence within aging cohort addition observed donors senescence burden subtype composition indicative susceptibility doxorubicininduced senescence functional analysis revealed subtypedependent responses senotherapies c responsive combination dasatinib quercetin singlecell analysis framework senscout enables robust identification classification senescence subtypes offering applications nextgeneration senotherapy screens potential toward explaining heterogeneous senescence phenotypes based presence senescence subtypes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress plasma viral loads in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH), it cannot eliminate HIV-1 proviruses persisting in various tissue reservoirs, and HIV-1 will rebound after ART cessation. We have recently identified the appendix as a novel HIV tissue reservoir, but nothing is known about the provirus and the cellular tropism in this tissue. We utilized single genome analysis of HIV-1 env DNA and compared the viral sequences from appendix tissues and lymph nodes of the same PLWH. Sequential multiplex immunofluorescence labeling and RNAscope in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded appendix sections were performed to identify cell types harboring HIV-1 proviral DNA in the appendix, by visualizing viral and cellular biomarkers co-localization. The viral populations from the appendix were less heterogeneous compared to the lymph nodes in aviremic individuals, suggesting there is reduced ART selective pressure or the presence of appendix tropic HIV-1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the follicular dendritic cell (FDC), rather than CD4+ T cell within the appendix is the major cell type harboring subtype C HIV-1. Notably, although some subtype C HIV-1 signals could be remaining virions captured by FDCs even in aviremic individuals, HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected in some FDCs in the appendix tissues of aviremic individuals, indicating the presence of infected FDCs. These results highlight the importance of analyzing all potential tissue and cellular tropism across different HIV-1 subtypes, to inform tailored therapeutic strategies for the diverse reservoirs that may differ across subtypes.",Single-Cell Analysis,although antiretroviral therapy art suppress plasma viral loads people living hiv plwh cannot eliminate hiv proviruses persisting various tissue reservoirs hiv rebound art cessation recently identified appendix novel hiv tissue reservoir nothing known provirus cellular tropism tissue utilized single genome analysis hiv env dna compared viral sequences appendix tissues lymph nodes plwh sequential multiplex immunofluorescence labeling rnascope situ hybridization formalinfixed paraffinembedded appendix sections performed identify cell types harboring hiv proviral dna appendix visualizing viral cellular biomarkers colocalization viral populations appendix less heterogeneous compared lymph nodes aviremic individuals suggesting reduced art selective pressure presence appendix tropic hiv furthermore demonstrated follicular dendritic cell fdc rather cd cell within appendix major cell type harboring subtype c hiv notably although subtype c hiv signals could remaining virions captured fdcs even aviremic individuals hiv proviral dna detected fdcs appendix tissues aviremic individuals indicating presence infected fdcs results highlight importance analyzing potential tissue cellular tropism across different hiv subtypes inform tailored therapeutic strategies diverse reservoirs may differ across subtypes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Phenotypic differences between individuals of a species are often caused by differences in gene expression, which are in turn caused by genetic variation. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is a methodology by which we can identify such causal variants. Scaling eQTL analysis is costly due to the expense of generating mapping populations, and the collection of matched transcriptomic and genomic information. We developed a rapid eQTL analysis approach using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing of gametes from a small number of heterozygous individuals. Patterns of inherited polymorphisms are used to infer the recombinant genomes of thousands of individual gametes and identify how different haplotypes correlate with variation in gene expression. Applied to Arabidopsis pollen nuclei, our approach uncovers both cis- and trans-eQTLs, ultimately mapping variation in a master regulator of sperm cell development that affects the expression of hundreds of genes. This establishes snRNA-sequencing as a powerful, cost-effective method for the mapping of meiotic recombination, addressing the scalability challenges of eQTL analysis and enabling eQTL mapping in specific cell-types.",Single-Cell Analysis,phenotypic differences individuals species often caused differences gene expression turn caused genetic variation expression quantitative trait locus eqtl analysis methodology identify causal variants scaling eqtl analysis costly due expense generating mapping populations collection matched transcriptomic genomic information developed rapid eqtl analysis approach using singlecellnucleus rna sequencing gametes small number heterozygous individuals patterns inherited polymorphisms used infer recombinant genomes thousands individual gametes identify different haplotypes correlate variation gene expression applied arabidopsis pollen nuclei approach uncovers cis transeqtls ultimately mapping variation master regulator sperm cell development affects expression hundreds genes establishes snrnasequencing powerful costeffective method mapping meiotic recombination addressing scalability challenges eqtl analysis enabling eqtl mapping specific celltypes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Mosunetuzumab, a CD20 × CD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody, redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. The purpose of YO43555 was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mosunetuzumab as a single agent in Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (R/R FL). The impact of ethnicity/region on the PK disposition of mosunetuzumab was assessed by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) as well as a population PK (popPK) approach. A previously established popPK model for intravenous mosunetuzumab, built from the global Phase I/II study GO29781, was externally validated with the PK data from study YO43555. Results from the PK analysis showed that the global popPK model adequately captured the individual PK of the Chinese population. The model predicted mosunetuzumab exposure metrics in Chinese patients were similar to those observed in Asian patients in the GO29781 R/R FL subpopulation with the same dose regimen, while the exposure differences between Chinese and Non-Asians from the global population were < 20%. An overlay of the exposure levels for Chinese patients on the established E-R relationship in global patients indicated that the mosunetuzumab exposure of Chinese patients remained within the established bounds for clinical safety and efficacy. The cytokine biomarkers IL-6 and TNF-α showed similar time-course patterns of release as observed in globally enrolled patients. In summary, mosunetuzumab PK disposition did not show significant ethnic sensitivity that would impact patient outcomes. Therefore, dose adjustment of the globally approved mosunetuzumab regimen is not warranted for Chinese patients with R/R FL.

"<i>In vitro</i> models aim to recapitulate human physiological processes, improving upon and replacing the need for animal-based models. Modeling bone formation via endochondral ossification <i>in vitro</i> is a very complex process due to the large number of cell types involved. Most current models are limited to mimicking the initial stages of the process (i.e., cartilage template formation and mineralization of the matrix), using a single cell type. Chondroclasts/osteoclasts are key players in cartilage resorption during endochondral ossification, but their introduction into <i>in vitro</i> models has thus far proven challenging. In this study, we aimed toward a new level of model complexity by introducing human monocyte-derived osteoclasts into 3D <i>in vitro-</i>cultured cartilage templates undergoing mineralization. Chondrogenic and mineralized chondrogenic pellets were formed from human pediatric bone marrow stromal cells and cultured in the presence of transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β) and TGF-β/β-glycerophosphate, respectively. These pellets have the capacity to form bone if implanted <i>in vivo.</i> To identify suitable <i>in vitro</i> co-culture conditions and investigate cell interactions, pellets were co-cultured with CD14+ monocytes in an indirect (transwell) or direct setting for up to 14 days, and osteoclastogenesis was assessed by means of histological stainings, osteoclast counting, and gene expression analysis. Upon direct co-culture, we achieved effective osteoclast formation <i>in situ</i> in regions of both mineralized and unmineralized cartilages. Notably, <i>in vitro</i>-generated osteoclasts showed the ability to form tunnels in the chondrogenic matrix and infiltrate the mineralized matrix. Addition of osteoclasts in human <i>in vitro</i> models of endochondral ossification increases the physiological relevance of these models. This will allow for the development of robust 3D human <i>in vitro</i> systems for the study of bone formation, disease modeling, and drug discovery, further reducing the need for animal models in the future.",Single-Cell Analysis,iin vitroi models aim recapitulate human physiological processes improving upon replacing need animalbased models modeling bone formation via endochondral ossification iin vitroi complex process due large number cell types involved current models limited mimicking initial stages process ie cartilage template formation mineralization matrix using single cell type chondroclastsosteoclasts key players cartilage resorption endochondral ossification introduction iin vitroi models thus far proven challenging study aimed toward new level model complexity introducing human monocytederived osteoclasts iin vitroicultured cartilage templates undergoing mineralization chondrogenic mineralized chondrogenic pellets formed human pediatric bone marrow stromal cells cultured presence transforming growth factor tgf tgfglycerophosphate respectively pellets capacity form bone implanted iin vivoi identify suitable iin vitroi coculture conditions investigate cell interactions pellets cocultured cd monocytes indirect transwell direct setting days osteoclastogenesis assessed means histological stainings osteoclast counting gene expression analysis upon direct coculture achieved effective osteoclast formation iin situi regions mineralized unmineralized cartilages notably iin vitroigenerated osteoclasts showed ability form tunnels chondrogenic matrix infiltrate mineralized matrix addition osteoclasts human iin vitroi models endochondral ossification increases physiological relevance models allow development robust human iin vitroi systems study bone formation disease modeling drug discovery reducing need animal models future,Single-Cell Analysis

"Abundant research indicates that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insulin resistance (IR) have a certain association with autoimmune-related diseases (ARDs). However, the conclusions remain elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether there are causal associations between T2DM and IR indicator, triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index with ARDs, and evaluate the impact of immune cells. Comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis combined with Bayesian colocalization was employed to investigate the relationship between T2DM, TyG index, ARDs, and specific-marker immune cells by extracting summary-level data from various genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Further investigations utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis were performed to explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the MR analysis results. Causal associations of T2DM with multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were detected. Additionally, the TyG index was genetically predicted to be associated with MS. Furthermore, immune cells were found to be related to T2DM and TyG index, of which CD3 on naive CD8 + T cell mediate the effect on the association between TyG index and multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, genetic variation of TCF7L2 and TNFSF13B were assessed to play a crucial role in the aforementioned associations supported by colocalization analysis.

The present study was conducted to explore genetic associations for OTSCC. A GWAS on 376 cases of OTSCC was conducted using the FinnGen Data Freeze-12 dataset. The case-cohort included 205 males and 171 females. Cases with malignancies involving the base of the tongue or lingual tonsil were excluded from the case-cohort. Individuals with no recorded history of malignancy were used as controls (n = 407,067). A Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was performed for the lead variants to assess their co-associations with other cancers.

"Protoplasts are single cells enclosed by the plasma membrane after cell wall removal. They are widely used in various biotechnological applications, including gene functional analysis, verification of genome editing reagents, and plant regeneration. Recent advances in genome editing have enabled the production of non-chimeric and transgene-free genome-edited plants using protoplasts. This process involves protoplast isolation, transformation, and regeneration, requiring advanced technical skills. Challenges in isolation and regeneration have limited their use in genome editing. In grapevines, however, very few studies have reported the use of protoplasts isolated from leaves. Efficient isolation and transformation protocols for Chardonnay remain lacking and require cultivar-specific optimization. In this study, we established a reliable and efficient protoplast isolation and transformation system by optimizing conditions for protoplast isolation and PEG-mediated transformation in Chardonnay cultivar. The yield of viable protoplasts was approximately 75 × 10<sup>6</sup> per gram of leaf material, with a viability of 91%. A transformation efficiency of 87% was achieved under the optimized conditions. To evaluate the regeneration ability of mesophyll protoplast, transformed and untransformed protoplasts were cultured on solid and liquid MS media supplemented with 2 mg/L 2,4-D and 0.5 mg/L BA to facilitate microcalli formation. Microcalli formed on the feeder layer and developed into calli when transferred to liquid MS culture with 2 mg/L 2,4-D and 0.5 mg/L BA. However, the calli were unable to regenerate into roots or shoots.

"Research on viper venom has expanded into diverse medical applications, including cancer treatment. This study investigates the potential of <i>Vipera ammodytes</i> venom in oncology, evaluating its cytotoxicity and chemosensitising effects on malignant melanoma cells. Proteomic analysis identified 125 proteins in the venom, with Phospholipases A2, C-type lectins, and metalloproteinases among the most abundant components. These proteins are associated with cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and tumor-inhibiting properties. Three melanoma cell lines (M001, Me501, and A375) were used to assess venom cytotoxicity. The IC50 values demonstrated consistent venom sensitivity across cell lines (approximately 1.1 µg/mL). Combined treatment with venom and cisplatin significantly increased the cytotoxicity compared to single-agent treatments. Notably, venom enhanced the sensitivity of cisplatin in resistant cell lines (M001 and Me501), increasing cell mortality by up to 40%. The A375 cell line, inherently more sensitive to cisplatin, exhibited additional cytotoxic effects only at higher venom doses. The morphological changes observed under microscopy confirmed venom-induced cellular changes, further supporting its potential as an anti-cancer agent. The selective targeting of melanoma cells by venom components, particularly in muscle-associated metastases, suggests a unique therapeutic niche. While cisplatin was chosen for this pilot study due to its established cytotoxicity, future research will explore venom combinations with contemporary treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

"Beyond the genomic and proteomic analysis of bulk and single cancer cells, a new focus of cancer research is emerging that is based on the mechanical analysis of cancer cells. Therefore, several biophysical techniques have been developed and adapted. The characterization of cancer cells, like human cancer cell lines, started with their mechanical characterization at mostly a single timepoint. A universal hypothesis has been proposed that cancer cells need to be softer to migrate and invade tissues and subsequently metastasize in targeted organs. Thus, the softness of cancer cells has been suggested to serve as a universal physical marker for the malignancy of cancer types. However, it has turned out that there exists the opposite phenomenon, namely that stiffer cancer cells are more migratory and invasive and therefore lead to more metastases. These contradictory results question the universality of the role of softness of cancer cells in the malignant progression of cancers. Another problem is that the various biophysical techniques used can affect the mechanical properties of cancer cells, making it even more difficult to compare the results of different studies. Apart from the instrumentation, the culture and measurement conditions of the cancer cells can influence the mechanical measurements. The review highlights the main advances of the mechanical characterization of cancer cells, discusses the strength and weaknesses of the approaches, and questions whether the passive mechanical characterization of cancer cells is still state-of-the art. Besides the cell models, conditions and biophysical setups, the role of the microenvironment on the mechanical characteristics of cancer cells is presented and debated. Finally, combinatorial approaches to determine the malignant potential of tumors, such as the involvement of the ECM, the cells in a homogeneous or heterogeneous association, or biological multi-omics analyses, together with the dynamic-mechanical analysis of cancer cells, are highlighted as new frontiers of research.",Single-Cell Analysis,beyond genomic proteomic analysis bulk single cancer cells new focus cancer research emerging based mechanical analysis cancer cells therefore several biophysical techniques developed adapted characterization cancer cells like human cancer cell lines started mechanical characterization mostly single timepoint universal hypothesis proposed cancer cells need softer migrate invade tissues subsequently metastasize targeted organs thus softness cancer cells suggested serve universal physical marker malignancy cancer types however turned exists opposite phenomenon namely stiffer cancer cells migratory invasive therefore lead metastases contradictory results question universality role softness cancer cells malignant progression cancers another problem various biophysical techniques used affect mechanical properties cancer cells making even difficult compare results different studies apart instrumentation culture measurement conditions cancer cells influence mechanical measurements review highlights main advances mechanical characterization cancer cells discusses strength weaknesses approaches questions whether passive mechanical characterization cancer cells still stateofthe art besides cell models conditions biophysical setups role microenvironment mechanical characteristics cancer cells presented debated finally combinatorial approaches determine malignant potential tumors involvement ecm cells homogeneous heterogeneous association biological multiomics analyses together dynamicmechanical analysis cancer cells highlighted new frontiers research,Single-Cell Analysis
"Molecular analyses of individual cells with high resolution, specificity, and sensitivity can not only reveal cellular heterogeneity but also provide a better understanding of diseases and accelerate drug discoveries. Single-cell endoscopy is an advanced live-cell technique that relies on a smart endoscope that allows minimally invasive probing of the interiors of individual cells. Compared with other single-cell analysis techniques, single-cell endoscopy has shown great promise in applications such as flexible single-cell manipulation, ultrasensitive sensing, and precise intracellular delivery. In this review, we aim to map out the landscape of recent advances in single-cell endoscopy techniques by focusing on both fundamental considerations and significant progress over the past decade.

"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are vital indicators of metastasis and provide a non-invasive method for early cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring. However, their low prevalence and heterogeneity in the bloodstream pose significant challenges for detection. Microfluidic systems, or ""lab-on-a-chip"" devices, have emerged as a revolutionary tool in liquid biopsy, enabling efficient isolation and analysis of CTCs. These systems offer advantages such as reduced sample volume, enhanced sensitivity, and the ability to integrate multiple processes into a single platform. Several microfluidic techniques, including size-based filtration, dielectrophoresis, and immunoaffinity capture, have been developed to enhance CTC detection. The integration of machine learning (ML) with microfluidic systems has further improved the specificity and accuracy of CTC detection, significantly advancing the speed and efficiency of early cancer diagnosis. ML models have enabled more precise analysis of CTCs by automating detection processes and enhancing the ability to identify rare and heterogeneous cell populations.

"Plasmid construction is central to life science research, and sequence verification is arguably its costliest step. Long-read sequencing has emerged as a competitor to Sanger sequencing, with the principal benefit that whole plasmids can be sequenced in a single run. Nevertheless, the current cost of nanopore sequencing is still prohibitive for routine sequencing during plasmid construction. We develop a computational approach termed Simple Algorithm for Very Efficient Multiplexing of Oxford Nanopore Experiments for You (SAVEMONEY) that guides researchers to mix multiple plasmids and subsequently computationally de-mixes the resultant sequences. SAVEMONEY defines optimal mixtures in a pre-survey step, and following sequencing, executes a post-analysis workflow involving sequence classification, alignment, and consensus determination. By using Bayesian analysis with prior probability of expected plasmid construction error rate, high-confidence sequences can be obtained for each plasmid in the mixture. Plasmids differing by as little as two bases can be mixed as a single sample for nanopore sequencing, and routine multiplexing of even six plasmids per 180 reads can still maintain high accuracy of consensus sequencing. SAVEMONEY should further democratize whole-plasmid sequencing by nanopore and related technologies, driving down the effective cost of whole-plasmid sequencing to lower than that of a single Sanger sequencing run.",Single-Cell Analysis,plasmid construction central life science research sequence verification arguably costliest step longread sequencing emerged competitor sanger sequencing principal benefit whole plasmids sequenced single run nevertheless current cost nanopore sequencing still prohibitive routine sequencing plasmid construction develop computational approach termed simple algorithm efficient multiplexing oxford nanopore experiments savemoney guides researchers mix multiple plasmids subsequently computationally demixes resultant sequences savemoney defines optimal mixtures presurvey step following sequencing executes postanalysis workflow involving sequence classification alignment consensus determination using bayesian analysis prior probability expected plasmid construction error rate highconfidence sequences obtained plasmid mixture plasmids differing little two bases mixed single sample nanopore sequencing routine multiplexing even six plasmids per reads still maintain high accuracy consensus sequencing savemoney democratize wholeplasmid sequencing nanopore related technologies driving effective cost wholeplasmid sequencing lower single sanger sequencing run,Single-Cell Analysis
"Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, particularly by influencing macrophage function. This study aimed to identify lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) marker genes involved in the onset and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) analyses. Mutation and RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were analyzed to explore the relationship between lipid metabolism pathways and NSCLC progression. scRNA-seq analysis revealed macrophage subtypes closely associated with lipid metabolism, with three key marker genes-S100A10, HLA-DMB, and CTSL-identified as predictive factors for patient prognosis. A prognostic risk scoring model was constructed and validated using survival analysis and ROC curves, demonstrating high accuracy in stratifying NSCLC patients by risk. Further in vivo experiments using subcutaneous tumor xenografts and lung metastasis models showed that S100A10 and CTSL promoted tumor growth and metastasis, while HLA-DMB inhibited these processes. Immune infiltration analysis highlighted the immunological relevance of the identified marker genes, providing insights into their functional roles. This study underscores the critical influence of LAMs in NSCLC progression and highlights a robust prognostic model that offers potential therapeutic targets for improving patient outcomes.",Single-Cell Analysis,lipid metabolism plays pivotal role shaping tumor microenvironment particularly influencing macrophage function study aimed identify lipidassociated macrophage lam marker genes involved onset progression nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc integrated singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq bulk rna sequencing bulk rnaseq analyses mutation rnaseq data cancer genome atlas tcga gene expression omnibus geo databases analyzed explore relationship lipid metabolism pathways nsclc progression scrnaseq analysis revealed macrophage subtypes closely associated lipid metabolism three key marker genessa hladmb ctslidentified predictive factors patient prognosis prognostic risk scoring model constructed validated using survival analysis roc curves demonstrating high accuracy stratifying nsclc patients risk vivo experiments using subcutaneous tumor xenografts lung metastasis models showed sa ctsl promoted tumor growth metastasis hladmb inhibited processes immune infiltration analysis highlighted immunological relevance identified marker genes providing insights functional roles study underscores critical influence lams nsclc progression highlights robust prognostic model offers potential therapeutic targets improving patient outcomes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Minimally-invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) is confirmed to mitigate the post-perfusion syndrome resulting in better outcomes in operated patients compared to the conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (ECC). To determine whether there is a clinical benefit of lower blood loss in patients operated on MiECC compared to ECC. To provide a detailed construction of modified MiECC and its perfusion management. Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting on MiECC or ECC. The primary outcome was to compare the following variables in the 2 groups: intraoperative and 30-day mortality and cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and cerebral stroke (MACCE). Secondary outcomes included surgical revision for bleeding or tamponade, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss and the consumption of packed red blood cell units. We modified our MiECC by connecting a cardiotomy suction. There was no mortality, major adverse events or surgical revisions in either group. No difference was found for intraoperative blood loss. The MiECC group had significantly lower overall postoperative blood loss (660 mL vs 765 mL, P=0.037). Total consumption of packed red blood cell units was insignificantly higher in the ECC group (n=30 vs n=20, P=0.490). MiECC is a safe alternative to conventional ECC in routine procedures such as CABG.

"Sudomotor dysfunction in diabetic patients increases the risk of fissures, infections, and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), thereby reducing the quality of life. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain inadequately elucidated. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that despite structural integrity, sweat glands (SGs) in diabetic individuals with DFUs, and a murine model of diabetic neuropathy (DN), exhibit functional impairments, as confirmed by histological and functional assays. Integrated transcriptome and proteome analysis revealed significant upregulation of the SG microenvironment in response to hypoxia, highlighting potential underlying pathways involved. In addition, histological staining and tissue clearing techniques provided evidence of impaired neurovascular networks adjacent to SGs. Single-cell RNA sequencing unveiled intricate intercellular communication networks among endothelial cells (ECs), neural cells (NCs), and sweat gland cells (SGCs), emphasizing intricate cellular interactions within the SG microenvironment. Furthermore, an in vitro SGC-NC interaction model (SNIM) was employed to validate the supportive role of NCs in regulating SGC functions, highlighting the neurovascular-SG axis in diabetic pathophysiology. These findings confirm the hypoxia-driven upregulation of the SG microenvironment and underscore the critical role of the neurovascular-SG axis in diabetic pathophysiology, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for managing diabetic complications and improving patient outcomes.",Single-Cell Analysis,sudomotor dysfunction diabetic patients increases risk fissures infections diabetic foot ulcers dfus thereby reducing quality life despite clinical importance mechanisms underlying dysfunction remain inadequately elucidated study addresses gap demonstrating despite structural integrity sweat glands sgs diabetic individuals dfus murine model diabetic neuropathy dn exhibit functional impairments confirmed histological functional assays integrated transcriptome proteome analysis revealed significant upregulation sg microenvironment response hypoxia highlighting potential underlying pathways involved addition histological staining tissue clearing techniques provided evidence impaired neurovascular networks adjacent sgs singlecell rna sequencing unveiled intricate intercellular communication networks among endothelial cells ecs neural cells ncs sweat gland cells sgcs emphasizing intricate cellular interactions within sg microenvironment furthermore vitro sgcnc interaction model snim employed validate supportive role ncs regulating sgc functions highlighting neurovascularsg axis diabetic pathophysiology findings confirm hypoxiadriven upregulation sg microenvironment underscore critical role neurovascularsg axis diabetic pathophysiology providing insights potential therapeutic targets managing diabetic complications improving patient outcomes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Tumors remain a major cause of death worldwide due to late-stage presentation and late diagnosis. Cell therapies have revolutionized the landscape in the precision treatment of tumors. However, there are still many challenges that limit the therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, cancer treatment also entails a major financial burden throughout the entire phase, making it preferable to find a specific biomarker for the early prognosis of the tumor. In this study, the role of CD248 in pan-cancer was analyzed through diverse tumor-associated databases, such as the Human Protein Atlas Database, the GEPIA2 Database, the cBioPortal Database, the TIMER Database, the STRING tool, and so on. In addition, CD248 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in a series of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) cell lines using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Furthermore, siCD248 was used to detect the effect of CD248 on the invasion, migration, and proliferation of HNSC cells by transwell assay, scratch wound healing assay, and EdU assay, respectively. CD248 expression was significantly increased and correlated with advanced stage and poor prognosis in various tumors. Genetic alterations of CD248 were also associated with a poor prognosis of patients. Single-cell sequencing revealed that CD248 was mainly expressed on fibroblasts within the stroma, and its expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells in tumors. In addition, CD248 interacted with 11 common tumor biomarkers. Experiment results indicated that CD248 mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in HNSC cell lines, and inhibition of CD248 suppresses the invasion, migration, and proliferation of HNSC cells. High CD248 expression played a crucial role in pan-cancer, including immune cell infiltration, tumor progression and metastasis, and patient prognosis. CD248 plays a crucial role in tumor cells' functions, including invasion, migration, and proliferation. All these findings indicated that CD248 may be a novel oncoprotein and a potential therapeutic target for pan-cancer.",Single-Cell Analysis,tumors remain major cause death worldwide due latestage presentation late diagnosis cell therapies revolutionized landscape precision treatment tumors however still many challenges limit therapeutic efficacy additionally cancer treatment also entails major financial burden throughout entire phase making preferable find specific biomarker early prognosis tumor study role cd pancancer analyzed diverse tumorassociated databases human protein atlas database gepia database cbioportal database timer database string tool addition cd mrna protein levels assessed series head neck squamous cell carcinoma hnsc cell lines using qrtpcr western blot furthermore sicd used detect effect cd invasion migration proliferation hnsc cells transwell assay scratch wound healing assay edu assay respectively cd expression significantly increased correlated advanced stage poor prognosis various tumors genetic alterations cd also associated poor prognosis patients singlecell sequencing revealed cd mainly expressed fibroblasts within stroma expression positively correlated infiltration immune cells tumors addition cd interacted common tumor biomarkers experiment results indicated cd mrna protein expression upregulated hnsc cell lines inhibition cd suppresses invasion migration proliferation hnsc cells high cd expression played crucial role pancancer including immune cell infiltration tumor progression metastasis patient prognosis cd plays crucial role tumor cells functions including invasion migration proliferation findings indicated cd may novel oncoprotein potential therapeutic target pancancer,Single-Cell Analysis
"The bile acid metabolism (BAM) and fatty acid metabolism (FAM) have been implicated in Kawasaki disease (KD), but their precise mechanisms remain unclear. Identifying signature cells and genes related to BAM and FAM could offer a deeper understanding of their role in the pathogenesis of KD. We analyzed the public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset GSE1687323 to characterize the immune cell-type landscape in KD. Gene sets related to BAM and FAM were collected from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) database and previous literature. We analyzed the cellular heterogeneity of BAM and FAM at the single-cell level using R packages. Through differential expressed genes (DEG) analysis, high-dimensional Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (hdWGCNA) and machine learning algorithms, we identified signature genes associated with both BAM and FAM. The cellular expression patterns of signature genes were further validated using our own scRNA-seq dataset. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the expression levels of signature genes in KD, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate their diagnostic potential. Enhanced BAM and FAM were detected in monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells from KD in the public scRNA-seq dataset. Our scRNA-seq data confirmed the signature genes identified by machine learning algorithms: Vimentin (VIM) and chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) were upregulated in monocytes, while integrin subunit beta 2 (ITGB2) was elevated in NK cells of KD. qRT-PCR results also validated the bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, these genes demonstrated significant diagnostic potential. In the training dataset (GSE68004), the area under the curve (AUC) values and 95% CI were as follows: VIM: 0.914 (0.863-0.966), ITGB2: 0.958 (0.925-0.991), and CLIC1: 0.985 (0.969-1). The validation dataset (GSE73461) yielded similarly robust results, with AUC values and 95% CI: VIM: 0.872 (0.811-0.934), ITGB2: 0.861 (0.795-0.928), and CLIC1: 0.893 (0.837-0.948). This study successfully identified and validated VIM and CLIC1 in monocytes, as well as ITGB2 in NK cells, as novel metabolism-related genes in KD.

"Clinical trials do not typically assess underlying molecular mechanisms of vaccine immunogenicity or reactogenicity. We evaluated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 4 mRNA vaccines and potential contributing mechanisms and identified shared and unique clinical and immunologic features. This ongoing, open-label, phase 1 trial randomized healthy adults (18-75 years) to receive a single dose of mRNA-1273.222 (bivalent COVID-19), mRNA-1345 (RSV), mRNA-1010 (influenza), and FLUAD (active influenza comparator) or 2 or 3 doses of mRNA-1647 (CMV). The primary objective was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study vaccine, with humoral immunogenicity (neutralizing antibody [nAb] responses) as the secondary objective. This interim analysis reports safety and reactogenicity in all study vaccines and humoral immunogenicity in single-dose vaccines (mRNA-1273.222, mRNA-1345, mRNA-1010, and FLUAD). Exploratory objectives included antigen-specific T-cell responses after single-dose mRNA-1345 or mRNA-1273.222, and soluble mediators of inflammation and innate immunity following vaccination in single-dose vaccine groups and two doses of mRNA-1647. At the interim analysis data cutoff (February 1, 2023), 302 participants received 1 dose of the study vaccines. Reactogenicity exhibited a consistent trend across vaccine groups; most solicited local and systemic adverse reactions within 7 days were mild or moderate in severity. There were no deaths or serious, severe, or treatment-related adverse events leading to study discontinuation. At Day 29, nAb titers against vaccine-specific antigens increased 2- to 8-fold versus baseline for all single-dose vaccine groups. In an exploratory analysis, mRNA-1273.222 and mRNA-1345 induced antigen-specific Th1-biased CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses at Day 29. The cytokine response analysis showed increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-2Ra, CXCL9, IP-10, MCP-2, and MIP-1β on Day 2 following vaccination, with generally greater increases observed with mRNA vaccines versus FLUAD. Regardless of age and across mRNA vaccine groups, peak serum levels of IL-1Ra and MCP-1/MCP-2 on Day 2 weakly correlated with systemic reactogenicity scores (correlation coefficient range: 0.15-0.27). The 4 mRNA vaccines had acceptable reactogenicity, demonstrated changes in serum biomarkers of innate immune activation, and were immunogenic. This suggests that the observed reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines may be related to shared features of the mRNA platform (LNP platform).

"Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a leading cause of end-stage renal disease, exerts a substantial burden on healthcare systems globally. Emerging evidence highlights ferroptosis - an iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion - as a critical contributor to DN progression via oxidative stress, tubular injury, and glomerular dysfunction. Despite increasing research interest, a comprehensive synthesis of research trends and mechanistic insights is lacking. This study integrated bibliometric analysis with a mechanistic review to map the evolving ferroptosis landscape in DN, identify research hotspots, and propose future directions for therapeutic development. In total, 86 publications (2018-2023) were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Co-occurrence networks, citation trends, and keyword bursts were examined to delineate global contributions, collaborative networks, and emerging themes. Annual publication numbers surged 12-fold after 2020, with China contributing the highest proportion (60.4%), and led by institutions such as Zhengzhou University. The United States of America and Germany showed high centrality in collaborative networks. Key research themes included glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-mediated antioxidant defenses, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4)-mediated lipid remodeling, and iron dysregulation. <i>Frontiers in Endocrinology</i> (nine articles) and <i>Free Radical Biology and Medicine</i> (highest citation count: 171) emerged as pivotal publication platforms.

Preclinical agents, including ginkgolide B (GB) and dapagliflozin, effectively restored iron homeostasis and attenuated oxidative damage. Ferroptosis is a promising therapeutic target for DN, yet its clinical translation remains in its infancy.

"Supervised and unsupervised methods have emerged to address the complexity of single cell data analysis in the context of large pools of independent studies. Here, we present ClusterFoldSimilarity (CFS), a novel statistical method design to quantify the similarity between cell groups across any number of independent datasets, without the need for data correction or integration. By bypassing these processes, CFS avoids the introduction of artifacts and loss of information, offering a simple, efficient, and scalable solution. This method match groups of cells that exhibit conserved phenotypes across datasets, including different tissues and species, and in a multimodal scenario, including single-cell RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, single-cell proteomics, or, more broadly, data exhibiting differential abundance effects among groups of cells. Additionally, CFS performs feature selection, obtaining cross-dataset markers of the similar phenotypes observed, providing an inherent interpretability of relationships between cell populations. To showcase the effectiveness of our methodology, we generated single-nuclei RNA-Seq data from the motor cortex and spinal cord of adult mice. By using CFS, we identified three distinct sub-populations of astrocytes conserved on both tissues.

"The incorporation of non-native chemical elements, such as silicon, into drug molecules has gained significant attention as a strategy to broaden the chemical space in medicinal chemistry and develop novel drug candidates. Traditionally, research has focused on the isosteric replacement of a carbon atom with silicon (""silicon switch"") in known drug structures or the attachment of a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group to biologically active scaffolds. In this study, a TMS-substituted indoloquinoline-based Schiff base (HLTMS) and its corresponding metal complexes, <b>Cu(HL</b><sup><b>TMS</b></sup><b>)Cl</b><sub><b>2</b></sub> (1) and <b>Zn(HL</b><sup><b>TMS</b></sup><b>)Cl</b><sub><b>2</b></sub> (2), were synthesized and comprehensively characterized using elemental analysis, spectroscopic techniques (IR, UV-vis, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR for HLTMS and 2), ESI mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) for 1 and electron diffraction (ED) for 2. The attachment of the TMS group enhanced the lipophilicity of HLTMS, while complex formation with Cu(II) substantially improved the antiproliferative activity. Exploitation of their intrinsic fluorescence to investigate cellular uptake and intracellular localization in cancer cells was impeded by limited solubility. Both HLTMS and 2 were found to generate reactive oxygen species under cell-free conditions in accord with their redox activity established by cyclic voltammetry.

"Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 4 (LILRB4), an emerging immune checkpoint molecule, exhibits therapeutic potential in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of immune checkpoint genes have been extensively investigated in AML, the association between LILRB4 genetic polymorphisms and clinical outcomes remains unexplored. We investigated SNPs within the LILRB4 immunoglobulin domain and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) regions in 151 AML patients and 203 controls. The rs1048801 G allele was significantly associated with increased LILRB4 mRNA expression, higher disease susceptibility, and reduced overall survival. Functional studies revealed that the G allele enhanced AML cell proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis identified CD4 as a pivotal downstream mediator of LILRB4. Flow cytometry revealed elevated LILRB4 expression in CD45+ leukocytes and CD45+CD33+CD14+ monocytic AML cells from G allele carriers, concomitant with reduced CD3+CD4+ T cell populations and impaired proliferation. Collectively, these findings establish rs1048801 as a critical modulator of AML progression through LILRB4-mediated CD4+ T cells suppression, providing new insights for personalized therapeutic strategies.",Single-Cell Analysis,leukocyte immunoglobulinlike receptor subfamily b member lilrb emerging immune checkpoint molecule exhibits therapeutic potential acute myeloid leukemia aml single nucleotide polymorphisms snps immune checkpoint genes extensively investigated aml association lilrb genetic polymorphisms clinical outcomes remains unexplored investigated snps within lilrb immunoglobulin domain immunoreceptor tyrosinebased inhibitory motif itim regions aml patients controls rs g allele significantly associated increased lilrb mrna expression higher disease susceptibility reduced overall survival functional studies revealed g allele enhanced aml cell proliferation colony formation furthermore proteinprotein interaction network analysis identified cd pivotal downstream mediator lilrb flow cytometry revealed elevated lilrb expression cd leukocytes cdcdcd monocytic aml cells g allele carriers concomitant reduced cdcd cell populations impaired proliferation collectively findings establish rs critical modulator aml progression lilrbmediated cd cells suppression providing new insights personalized therapeutic strategies,Single-Cell Analysis
"Walking speed is a reliable marker of sarcopenia and a strong predictor of mortality, but its relationship with cancer incidence remains largely unexplored. We aimed to investigate the association between walking speed and the risk of any cancer and five common cancers, including lung, breast, colorectum, prostate, and stomach, and to explore potential mediation by biomarkers of inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The primary analysis was conducted in 431 598 participants from the UK Biobank (mean age 56.3 [SD 8.1] years at baseline), and the generalizability of findings was further tested in 1311 participants from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study (HKOS; mean age 57.8 [SD 11.9] years). Walking speed was self-reported in the UK Biobank and measured using a timed 6-m walk test in the HKOS. Incident cancer cases were identified from electronic health records. We used Cox models, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, socioeconomic, lifestyle factors, family history of cancer, and grip strength, to estimate the association between walking speed and cancer incidence. Single and multiple mediator models were performed in the UK Biobank to examine the mediating effects of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and glucose levels. Over a median follow-up of 10.9 and 6.9 years, 11.7% and 5.0% of the UK Biobank and HKOS participants were diagnosed with cancer, respectively. In the UK Biobank, those reported a brisk vs. slow walking pace had a 13% lower risk of any cancer (95% CI 0.84-0.90). Similarly, HKOS participants with a faster walking speed (≥ 1.0 vs. < 1.0 m/s) had a 45% reduced risk of any cancer (95% CI 0.31-0.98). In the UK Biobank, brisk walking pace was associated with a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.42-0.53) and a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). CRP, WBC count, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol significantly mediated the association between brisk walking pace and any cancer, with proportions of mediation being 6.4% (95% CI 4.4-8.7%), 11.4% (8.4-17.1%), 9.3% (7.1-12.9%), and 8.3% (6.1-11.9%), respectively. The combined mediated proportion of all five potential mediators was 25.9% (19.5-37.2%). Faster walking speed, whether self-reported or measured, is associated with a reduced risk of cancer development. This association appears to be partially mediated by lower inflammation and improved lipid profiles.",Single-Cell Analysis,walking speed reliable marker sarcopenia strong predictor mortality relationship cancer incidence remains largely unexplored aimed investigate association walking speed risk cancer five common cancers including lung breast colorectum prostate stomach explore potential mediation biomarkers inflammation lipid glucose metabolism primary analysis conducted participants uk biobank mean age sd years baseline generalizability findings tested participants hong kong osteoporosis study hkos mean age sd years walking speed selfreported uk biobank measured using timed walk test hkos incident cancer cases identified electronic health records used cox models adjusted age sex height body mass index socioeconomic lifestyle factors family history cancer grip strength estimate association walking speed cancer incidence single multiple mediator models performed uk biobank examine mediating effects creactive protein crp white blood cell wbc count total cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol glucose levels median followup years uk biobank hkos participants diagnosed cancer respectively uk biobank reported brisk vs slow walking pace lower risk cancer ci similarly hkos participants faster walking speed vs ms reduced risk cancer ci uk biobank brisk walking pace associated significantly decreased risk lung cancer hazard ratio hr ci slightly increased risk prostate cancer hr ci crp wbc count total cholesterol ldl cholesterol significantly mediated association brisk walking pace cancer proportions mediation ci respectively combined mediated proportion five potential mediators faster walking speed whether selfreported measured associated reduced risk cancer development association appears partially mediated lower inflammation improved lipid profiles,Single-Cell Analysis
"We previously developed the CellPhe toolkit, an open-source R package for automated cell phenotyping from ptychography time-lapse videos. To align with the growing adoption of python-based image analysis tools and to enhance interoperability with widely used software for cell segmentation and tracking, we developed a python implementation of CellPhe, named CellPhePy. CellPhePy preserves all of the core functionality of the original toolkit, including single-cell phenotypic feature extraction, time-series analysis, feature selection and cell type classification. In addition, CellPhePy introduces significant enhancements, such as an improved method for identifying features that differentiate cell populations and extended support for multiclass classification, broadening its analytical capabilities. Notably, the CellPhePy package supports CellPose segmentation and TrackMate tracking, meaning that a set of microscopy images are the only required input with segmentation, tracking and feature extraction fully automated for downstream analysis, without reliance on external applications. The workflow's increased flexibility and modularity make it adaptable to different imaging modalities and fully customisable to address specific research questions.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, with eventual widespread neurodegeneration. While the cell-specific molecular signature of end-stage AD is reasonably well characterized through autopsy material, less is known about the molecular pathways in the human brain involved in the earliest exposure to Aβ. Human model systems that not only replicate the pathological features of AD but also the transcriptional landscape in neurons, astrocytes and microglia are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we used a human 3D iPSC-derived neurosphere model to explore how resident neurons, microglia and astrocytes and their interplay are modified by chronic amyloidosis induced over 3-5 weeks by supplementing media with synthetic Aβ1 - 42 oligomers. Neurospheres under chronic Aβ exposure were grown with or without microglia to investigate the functional roles of microglia. Neuronal activity and oxidative stress were monitored using genetically encoded indicators, including GCaMP6f and roGFP1, respectively. Single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed to profile Aβ and microglia driven transcriptional changes in neurons and astrocytes, providing a comprehensive analysis of cellular responses. Microglia efficiently phagocytosed Aβ inside neurospheres and significantly reduced neurotoxicity, mitigating amyloidosis-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration following different exposure times to Aβ. The neuroprotective effects conferred by the presence of microglia was associated with unique gene expression profiles in astrocytes and neurons, including several known AD-associated genes such as APOE. These findings reveal how microglia can directly alter the molecular landscape of AD. Our human 3D neurosphere culture system with chronic Aβ exposure reveals how microglia may be essential for the cellular and transcriptional responses in AD pathogenesis. Microglia are not only neuroprotective in neurospheres but also act as key drivers of Aβ-dependent APOE expression suggesting critical roles for microglia in regulating APOE in the AD brain. This novel, well characterized, functional in vitro platform offers unique opportunities to study the roles and responses of microglia to Aβ modelling key aspects of human AD.

"Thermogenic beige adipocyte displays a remarkable ability in mammals to adapt to cold environments, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear, especially in pigs that lack functional UCP1. Multilocular beige adipocytes were observed in both Tibetan pigs (cold-tolerant) and Bama pigs (cold-sensitive) after short-term cold exposure (4 ℃ for 3 days). Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of adipose tissues, including subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissues (IAT) and perirenal adipose tissues (PAT), from both pig breeds at room temperature and cold treatment conditions, we discovered two cell subpopulations specific to Tibetan pigs, PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>EBF2<sup>High</sup> in IAT and ADIPOQ<sup>+</sup>HIF1A<sup>High</sup> in both depots. PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>EBF2<sup>High</sup> cells were characterized as potential beige precursors, while ADIPOQ<sup>+</sup>HIF1A<sup>High</sup> cells were found to express highly thermogenic-related genes. Despite the decrease of the lipogenic subpopulation and the increase of the lipolytic and the thermogenic subpopulations observed in both pig breeds upon cold treatment, Tibetan pigs exhibited stronger cellular and molecular responses compared to Bama pigs. Remarkably, cold-induced de novo beige adipogenesis and white adipocyte browning, likely occurred in Tibetan pigs, while Bama pigs relied more heavily on white browning. Moreover, BMP7, which was highly expressed in the PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>EBF2<sup>High</sup> subpopulation, positively regulates porcine beige thermogenic capacity.

"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-polyadenylated RNAs generated from back-splicing of genes. Multiple circRNAs can be generated at a single gene locus through alternative back-splicing events (ABS), sharing the same 5' or 3' back-splice site. To date, how prevalent ABS events are and how they are participated in carcinogenesis of human colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unexplored. To explore the functional roles of ABS events in CRC carcinogenesis, we analyzed ribosomal RNA-depleted transcriptome sequencing data of 176 CRC samples and characterized the landscape of ABS events in CRC. CRC cancer-related ABS events were identified by comparing paired CRC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Then, univariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to find prognostic ABS events. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to exploring the functional roles of circXPO1-1 and circXPO1-2 in CRC. We totally identified 19,611 high confidence circRNAs in CRC, among which 17,874 (91·1%) of circRNAs were found recurrently. The number of ABS circRNAs accounted for 68.8% of all identified high confidence circRNAs, which suggested that ABS events are prevalent in CRC transcriptome. Particularly, 552 ABS circRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed between paired CRC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their parent genes are closely associated with cancer-related hallmarks. In addition, 13 differential ABS circRNAs were identified to be associated with CRC patient survival and could act as independent prognostic indicators. Furthermore, we identified two ABS circRNAs of XPO1 gene (circXPO1-1 and circXPO1-2). The result showed that overexpression of circXPO1-2 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo, whereas circXPO1-1 is not, indicating that the circularization isoforms of XPO1 gene have different functions in CRC. In conclusion, our work provides the landscape of ABS events in CRC transcriptome and the close association of ABS circRNAs with tumorigenesis offers a new set of targets with potential clinical benefit.",Single-Cell Analysis,circular rnas circrnas class nonpolyadenylated rnas generated backsplicing genes multiple circrnas generated single gene locus alternative backsplicing events abs sharing backsplice site date prevalent abs events participated carcinogenesis human colorectal cancer crc remains unexplored explore functional roles abs events crc carcinogenesis analyzed ribosomal rnadepleted transcriptome sequencing data crc samples characterized landscape abs events crc crc cancerrelated abs events identified comparing paired crc tumor tissues adjacent normal tissues univariate multivariate cox regression used find prognostic abs events moreover vitro vivo assays used exploring functional roles circxpo circxpo crc totally identified high confidence circrnas crc among circrnas found recurrently number abs circrnas accounted identified high confidence circrnas suggested abs events prevalent crc transcriptome particularly abs circrnas found aberrantly expressed paired crc tumor tissues adjacent normal tissues parent genes closely associated cancerrelated hallmarks addition differential abs circrnas identified associated crc patient survival could act independent prognostic indicators furthermore identified two abs circrnas xpo gene circxpo circxpo result showed overexpression circxpo inhibited crc cell proliferation migration invasion vitro vivo whereas circxpo indicating circularization isoforms xpo gene different functions crc conclusion work provides landscape abs events crc transcriptome close association abs circrnas tumorigenesis offers new set targets potential clinical benefit,Single-Cell Analysis
"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is highly challenging to treat due to its poor prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Liposomal nanotechnology has emerged as a promising drug delivery platform in oncology, but existing liposomal therapies face limitations such as systemic toxicity, insufficient tumor selectivity, and low target specificity. Mesothelin (MSLN), an antigen overexpressed in PAAD, has attracted attention as a potential target for precision therapy. Here, we present the development of an anti-MSLN nanobody (D3 Nb) with high binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.2 nM) that can selectively bind to MSLN-positive cancer cells. Structural analysis revealed that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds within the complementary determining region (CDR) of D3 Nb promote strong binding to MSLN, leading to significant inhibition of AKT/NF-κB signaling and downregulation of fibronectin 1 (FN1) and twist1, key drivers of PAAD oncogenicity. In vivo studies confirmed that D3 Nb alone inhibits tumor progression. Furthermore, selective delivery to MSLN-positive tumors in combination with gemcitabine-loaded liposomes (D3-LNP-GEM) significantly improved cytotoxicity and promoted tumor regression. These findings highlight the potential of the D3-LNP-GEM platform as a novel targeted therapy for MSLN-expressing malignancies, showing promising efficacy in preclinical models and paving the way for continued clinical evaluation.",Single-Cell Analysis,pancreatic adenocarcinoma paad highly challenging treat due poor prognosis limited effective treatment options liposomal nanotechnology emerged promising drug delivery platform oncology existing liposomal therapies face limitations systemic toxicity insufficient tumor selectivity low target specificity mesothelin msln antigen overexpressed paad attracted attention potential target precision therapy present development antimsln nanobody nb high binding affinity ksubdsub nm selectively bind mslnpositive cancer cells structural analysis revealed hydrophobic hydrogen bonds within complementary determining region cdr nb promote strong binding msln leading significant inhibition aktnfb signaling downregulation fibronectin fn twist key drivers paad oncogenicity vivo studies confirmed nb alone inhibits tumor progression furthermore selective delivery mslnpositive tumors combination gemcitabineloaded liposomes dlnpgem significantly improved cytotoxicity promoted tumor regression findings highlight potential dlnpgem platform novel targeted therapy mslnexpressing malignancies showing promising efficacy preclinical models paving way continued clinical evaluation,Single-Cell Analysis
"Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in the brain is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond their conventional role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, certain miRNAs can act extracellularly as signaling molecules. Our study elucidates the identity of such miRNA species serving as ligands for membrane receptors expressed in central nervous system (CNS) neurons and the impact of such miRNAs on neurons in the context of neurodegenerative disease. We combined a machine learning approach with the analysis of disease-associated miRNA databases to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated miRNAs as potential signaling molecules for single-stranded RNA-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8. TLR-expressing HEK-Blue reporter cells, primary murine microglia, and human THP-1 macrophages were used to validate the AD miRNAs as ligands for human and mouse TLR7 and/or TLR8. Interaction between mouse cortical neurons and extracellularly applied AD miRNAs was analyzed by live cell imaging and confocal microscopy. Transcriptome changes in cortical neurons exposed to AD miRNAs were assessed by RNAseq and RT-qPCR. The extracellular AD miRNAs' effects on CNS neuron structure were investigated in cell cultures of murine primary cortical neurons and iPSC-derived human cortical neurons by immunocytochemistry. We employed a mouse model of intrathecal injection to assess effects of AD miRNAs acting as signaling molecules on neurons in vivo. We identified the AD-associated miRNAs miR-124-5p, miR-92a-1-5p, miR-9-5p, and miR-501-3p as novel endogenous ligands for TLR7 and/or TLR8. These miRNAs being extracellularly stable and active were taken up by murine cortical neurons via endocytosis and induced changes in neuronal inflammation-, proliferation-, and apoptosis-related gene expression. Exposure of both murine and human cortical neurons to the AD-associated miRNAs led to alterations of dendrite and axon structure, synapse protein expression, and cell viability in a sequence-dependent fashion. Extracellular introduction of the AD miRNAs into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice resulted in both changes in neuronal structure and synapses, and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex. Most of the observed extracellular miRNA-induced effects on cortical neurons involved TLR7/8 signaling. Neurodegenerative disease-associated miRNAs in extracellular form act as signaling molecules for CNS neurons including human cortical neurons, thereby modulating their structure and viability.",Single-Cell Analysis,dysregulation microrna mirna expression brain common feature neurodegenerative diseases beyond conventional role regulating gene expression posttranscriptional level certain mirnas act extracellularly signaling molecules study elucidates identity mirna species serving ligands membrane receptors expressed central nervous system cns neurons impact mirnas neurons context neurodegenerative disease combined machine learning approach analysis diseaseassociated mirna databases predict alzheimers disease adassociated mirnas potential signaling molecules singlestranded rnasensing tolllike receptors tlrs tlrexpressing hekblue reporter cells primary murine microglia human thp macrophages used validate ad mirnas ligands human mouse tlr andor tlr interaction mouse cortical neurons extracellularly applied ad mirnas analyzed live cell imaging confocal microscopy transcriptome changes cortical neurons exposed ad mirnas assessed rnaseq rtqpcr extracellular ad mirnas effects cns neuron structure investigated cell cultures murine primary cortical neurons ipscderived human cortical neurons immunocytochemistry employed mouse model intrathecal injection assess effects ad mirnas acting signaling molecules neurons vivo identified adassociated mirnas mirp mirap mirp mirp novel endogenous ligands tlr andor tlr mirnas extracellularly stable active taken murine cortical neurons via endocytosis induced changes neuronal inflammation proliferation apoptosisrelated gene expression exposure murine human cortical neurons adassociated mirnas led alterations dendrite axon structure synapse protein expression cell viability sequencedependent fashion extracellular introduction ad mirnas cerebrospinal fluid mice resulted changes neuronal structure synapses neuronal loss cerebral cortex observed extracellular mirnainduced effects cortical neurons involved tlr signaling neurodegenerative diseaseassociated mirnas extracellular form act signaling molecules cns neurons including human cortical neurons thereby modulating structure viability,Single-Cell Analysis
"Small cell carcinoma (SmCC) of the bladder is a rare and aggressive malignancy. Characterizing transcription factor (TF)-defined subtypes may provide insights into its biology and inform targeted therapies. This study investigates lineage-specific TF expression in bladder SmCC, its association with clinicopathological features, and comparisons with prostate SmCC. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 9 cases of bladder SmCC and 6 cases of prostate SmCC diagnosed at a single cancer hospital in Japan. Immunohistochemistry was performed for lineage-specific TFs (ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1) and neuroendocrine and other markers. Statistical comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test and independent samples t-tests. Combined SmCC morphology, including urothelial carcinoma (UC) (5 cases) and adenocarcinoma (2 cases), was more frequent in bladder SmCC than in prostate SmCC (78% [7 of 9 cases] vs. 17% [1 of 6 cases], p = 0.041). NEUROD1 was more frequently expressed in bladder SmCC than in prostate SmCC (67% [6 of 9 cases] vs. 0% [0 of 6 cases]; p = 0.028). NEUROD1 expression was more frequent in combined SmCC and UC bladder tumors than in other bladder SmCC tumors (100% [5 of 5 cases] vs. 25% [1 of 4 cases], p = 0.048). Conversely, HNF4A expression was absent in all combined SmCC and UC bladder tumors (0 of 5) but present in 75% (3 of 4) of other bladder SmCC tumors (p = 0.048). In 2 cases of bladder SmCC, NEUROD1 and POU2F3 were expressed in a mutually exclusive manner, with neuroendocrine markers expressed only in the NEUROD1-expressing component. NEUROD1 is characteristically expressed in bladder SmCC, especially in SmCC combined with UC, suggesting a distinct phenotype from prostate SmCC.

"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment faces significant clinical challenges. Lactate metabolism plays a crucial role in the initiation of many cancers and the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the prognostic significance of lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and the role of TME in HNSCC require further elucidation. We built a prognostic multigene signature with LMRGs and systematically correlated the risk signature with immunological characteristics and immunotherapy efficacy. Next, a series of single-cell sequencing analyses were used to characterize lactate metabolism in TME. Finally, single-cell sequencing analysis, immunofluorescence analyses, and a series of in vitro experiments were used to explore the role of PYGL in HNSCC. Potential drugs targeting PYGL were screened using AutoDock 4.2. A prognostic multigene signature based on LMRGs was developed, which effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Patients in the low-risk group exhibited reduced lactate metabolism, higher CD8 + T cell infiltration, and improved response to immunotherapy. Single-cell sequencing revealed that tumor cells had the most active lactate metabolism compared to other cells in the TME. PYGL, identified as the most critical prognostic gene, was highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and played a role in inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization. Knockdown of PYGL led to reduced lactate levels, and its expression was inversely correlated with CD8 + T cell infiltration. Furthermore, PYGL was involved in copper-dependent cell death, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Drug screening identified elesclomol, which showed promising results in PYGL-knockdown cells. The study established a robust LMRGs-based prognostic model that not only predicts patient survival but also correlates with the immune microenvironment in HNSCC. PYGL emerged as a key biomarker with significant implications for both prognosis and therapeutic intervention. Its role in regulating lactate metabolism and immune suppression suggests that targeting PYGL could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies. This research provides a foundation for future clinical strategies aimed at improving outcomes in HNSCC by modulating the tumor's metabolic and immune landscapes.",Single-Cell Analysis,head neck squamous cell carcinoma hnscc treatment faces significant clinical challenges lactate metabolism plays crucial role initiation many cancers tumor microenvironment tme however prognostic significance lactate metabolismrelated genes lmrgs role tme hnscc require elucidation built prognostic multigene signature lmrgs systematically correlated risk signature immunological characteristics immunotherapy efficacy next series singlecell sequencing analyses used characterize lactate metabolism tme finally singlecell sequencing analysis immunofluorescence analyses series vitro experiments used explore role pygl hnscc potential drugs targeting pygl screened using autodock prognostic multigene signature based lmrgs developed effectively stratified patients high lowrisk groups significant differences overall survival os progressionfree survival pfs patients lowrisk group exhibited reduced lactate metabolism higher cd cell infiltration improved response immunotherapy singlecell sequencing revealed tumor cells active lactate metabolism compared cells tme pygl identified critical prognostic gene highly expressed tumorassociated macrophages played role inhibiting macrophage polarization knockdown pygl led reduced lactate levels expression inversely correlated cd cell infiltration furthermore pygl involved copperdependent cell death highlighting potential therapeutic target drug screening identified elesclomol showed promising results pyglknockdown cells study established robust lmrgsbased prognostic model predicts patient survival also correlates immune microenvironment hnscc pygl emerged key biomarker significant implications prognosis therapeutic intervention role regulating lactate metabolism immune suppression suggests targeting pygl could enhance efficacy immunotherapies research provides foundation future clinical strategies aimed improving outcomes hnscc modulating tumors metabolic immune landscapes,Single-Cell Analysis
"Endocrine diseases are suspected contributors to lymphoid malignancies, but their precise association is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between various endocrine diseases-specifically type 2 diabetes, obesity, diabetic hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism-and lymphoid malignancies, including lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with subtypes like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Utilizing data from genome-wide association studies, a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed. The primary approach involved the inverse-variance weighted method, supplemented by other robust techniques such as the weighted median and MR-Egger regression to ensure reliability. The analysis indicated a significant causal connection between genetically predicted diabetic hypoglycemia and lymphocytic leukemia (Odds ratio = 1.0004, 95% Confidence interval = 1-1.0007, P = 0.03). Conversely, no associations were found for the other endocrine diseases with lymphoid malignancies (P > 0.05 for all). The findings suggest that while diabetic hypoglycemia may influence lymphocytic leukemia risk, further research is necessary to clarify the roles of other endocrine diseases in lymphoid malignancies, including cross-population validations and biological investigations.",Single-Cell Analysis,endocrine diseases suspected contributors lymphoid malignancies precise association unclear study aimed investigate causal relationship various endocrine diseasesspecifically type diabetes obesity diabetic hypoglycemia hyperlipidemia hyperthyroidismand lymphoid malignancies including lymphocytic leukemia nonhodgkins lymphoma subtypes like diffuse large bcell lymphoma follicular lymphoma utilizing data genomewide association studies twosample mendelian randomization analysis performed primary approach involved inversevariance weighted method supplemented robust techniques weighted median mregger regression ensure reliability analysis indicated significant causal connection genetically predicted diabetic hypoglycemia lymphocytic leukemia odds ratio confidence interval p conversely associations found endocrine diseases lymphoid malignancies p findings suggest diabetic hypoglycemia may influence lymphocytic leukemia risk research necessary clarify roles endocrine diseases lymphoid malignancies including crosspopulation validations biological investigations,Single-Cell Analysis
"Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly malignant tumor of the digestive system. The process of efferocytosis has been confirmed to be closely associated with tumor progression and microenvironment remodeling. Nevertheless, the mechanism of efferocytosis in GC remains unclear. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets with the TCGA transcriptome data for GC, focusing on the expression and distribution of efferocytosis-related genes (ERGs) at the single-cell level in GC. The prognostic features of ERGs are determined by Cox and LASSO analysis. And we analyzed and evaluated the differences between the two groups of patients in terms of long-term prognosis, immune infiltration, expression of immune checkpoints, and response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Seven cell types were identified from 10 GC samples. ERGs were mainly concentrated in macrophages, dividing macrophages into 5 cell subtypes.

"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiovascular disease characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right heart failure and death. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, it remains incurable, and its mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to integrate multi-omics data analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover the molecular characteristics and subtypes of PAH, providing insights into precise diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. We employed consensus clustering to classify PAH patients into subgroups based on multi-omics data. Differential expression and enrichment analyses were conducted to identify key genes and pathways. Machine learning models were developed to predict PAH subtypes and assess their diagnostic performance. PAH patients were divided into two subgroups: C1 and C2. The C2 subgroup showed significantly upregulated hypoxia-related genes, indicating distinct pathogenic mechanisms. Key genes associated with hypoxia, immune regulation, and inflammation were identified, alongside enriched pathways such as TNF, IL-17, and HIF-1 in the C2 subgroup. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy (AUC > 0.85) in distinguishing hypoxia-associated subtypes, supporting their utility for precise diagnosis. Potential therapeutic targets were identified in the TNF and HIF-1 pathways. This study provides novel insights into PAH's molecular subtypes and their distinct mechanisms, offering diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets for personalized treatment. Validation in larger cohorts and experimental studies is essential to confirm the identified biomarkers and pathways.",Single-Cell Analysis,pulmonary arterial hypertension pah progressive cardiovascular disease characterized elevated pulmonary arterial pressure leading right heart failure death despite advancements diagnosis treatment remains incurable mechanisms poorly understood study aimed integrate multiomics data analysis machine learning techniques uncover molecular characteristics subtypes pah providing insights precise diagnosis therapeutic strategies employed consensus clustering classify pah patients subgroups based multiomics data differential expression enrichment analyses conducted identify key genes pathways machine learning models developed predict pah subtypes assess diagnostic performance pah patients divided two subgroups c c c subgroup showed significantly upregulated hypoxiarelated genes indicating distinct pathogenic mechanisms key genes associated hypoxia immune regulation inflammation identified alongside enriched pathways tnf il hif c subgroup machine learning models achieved high accuracy auc distinguishing hypoxiaassociated subtypes supporting utility precise diagnosis potential therapeutic targets identified tnf hif pathways study provides novel insights pahs molecular subtypes distinct mechanisms offering diagnostic tools potential therapeutic targets personalized treatment validation larger cohorts experimental studies essential confirm identified biomarkers pathways,Single-Cell Analysis

"To identify the dynamics of neutrophil autoimmunity, here we focus on anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and perform single-cell transcriptome and surface proteome analyses on peripheral white blood cells from patients with new-onset microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Compared with controls, two neutrophil populations, immature neutrophils and neutrophils with type II interferon signature genes (Neu_T2ISG), are increased in patients with MPA. Trajectory and cell-cell interaction analyses identify Neu_T2ISG as a subset that differentiates from mature neutrophils upon stimulation with IFN-γ and TNF, which synergize to induce myeloperoxidase and Fcγ receptors expression on the neutrophil cell surface and promote ANCA-induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Case-by-case analysis indicates that patients with a high proportion of the Neu_T2ISG subset are associated with persistent vasculitis symptoms. A larger cohort analysis shows that serum IFN-γ levels at disease onset correlate with susceptibility to disease relapse. Our findings thus identify neutrophil diversity at the single cell level and implicate a biomarker for predicting relapse in small vessel vasculitis.",Single-Cell Analysis,identify dynamics neutrophil autoimmunity focus antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ancaassociated vasculitis perform singlecell transcriptome surface proteome analyses peripheral white blood cells patients newonset microscopic polyangiitis mpa compared controls two neutrophil populations immature neutrophils neutrophils type ii interferon signature genes neutisg increased patients mpa trajectory cellcell interaction analyses identify neutisg subset differentiates mature neutrophils upon stimulation ifn tnf synergize induce myeloperoxidase fc receptors expression neutrophil cell surface promote ancainduced neutrophil extracellular trap formation casebycase analysis indicates patients high proportion neutisg subset associated persistent vasculitis symptoms larger cohort analysis shows serum ifn levels disease onset correlate susceptibility disease relapse findings thus identify neutrophil diversity single cell level implicate biomarker predicting relapse small vessel vasculitis,Single-Cell Analysis
"Phenotypic changes in the morphology and internal organization of cells can indicate perturbations in cell functions. Therefore, imaging-based high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP) applications such as Cell Painting (CP) play an important role in basic and translational research, drug discovery, and regulatory toxicology. Here we present the Cell Painting PLUS (CPP) assay, an efficient, robust and broadly applicable approach that further expands the versatility of available HTPP methods and offers additional options for addressing mode-of-action specific research questions. An iterative staining-elution cycle allows multiplexing of at least seven fluorescent dyes that label nine different subcellular compartments and organelles including the plasma membrane, actin cytoskeleton, cytoplasmic RNA, nucleoli, lysosomes, nuclear DNA, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. In this way, CPP significantly expands the flexibility, customizability, and multiplexing capacity of the original CP method and, importantly, also improves the organelle-specificity and diversity of the phenotypic profiles due to the separate imaging and analysis of single dyes in individual channels.",Single-Cell Analysis,phenotypic changes morphology internal organization cells indicate perturbations cell functions therefore imagingbased highthroughput phenotypic profiling htpp applications cell painting cp play important role basic translational research drug discovery regulatory toxicology present cell painting plus cpp assay efficient robust broadly applicable approach expands versatility available htpp methods offers additional options addressing modeofaction specific research questions iterative stainingelution cycle allows multiplexing least seven fluorescent dyes label nine different subcellular compartments organelles including plasma membrane actin cytoskeleton cytoplasmic rna nucleoli lysosomes nuclear dna endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria golgi apparatus way cpp significantly expands flexibility customizability multiplexing capacity original cp method importantly also improves organellespecificity diversity phenotypic profiles due separate imaging analysis single dyes individual channels,Single-Cell Analysis
"Anti-viral immunity can vary tremendously from individual to individual but mechanistic understanding is still scarce. Here, we show that a defined, low complex bacterial community (OMM<sup>12</sup>) but not the general absence of microbes in germ-free mice leads to a more potent immune response compared to the microbiome of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice after a systemic viral infection with LCMV Clone-13. Consequently, gnotobiotic mice colonized with OMM<sup>12</sup> have more severe LCMV-induced disease pathology but also enhance viral clearance in the intestinal tract. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of adoptively transferred virus-specific T helper cells and endogenous T helper cells in the intestinal tract reveal a stronger pro-inflammatory Th1 profile and a more vigorous expansion in OMM<sup>12</sup> than SPF mice. Altogether, our work highlights the causative function of the intestinal microbiome for shaping adaptive anti-viral immunity with implications for vaccination strategies and anti-cancer treatment regimens.",Single-Cell Analysis,antiviral immunity vary tremendously individual individual mechanistic understanding still scarce show defined low complex bacterial community ommsupsup general absence microbes germfree mice leads potent immune response compared microbiome specificpathogenfree spf mice systemic viral infection lcmv clone consequently gnotobiotic mice colonized ommsupsup severe lcmvinduced disease pathology also enhance viral clearance intestinal tract mechanistically singlecell rna sequencing analysis adoptively transferred virusspecific helper cells endogenous helper cells intestinal tract reveal stronger proinflammatory th profile vigorous expansion ommsupsup spf mice altogether work highlights causative function intestinal microbiome shaping adaptive antiviral immunity implications vaccination strategies anticancer treatment regimens,Single-Cell Analysis
"Oxidative stress influences the tumor microenvironment, driving breast cancer progression and drug resistance. This study aimed to develop a prognostic gene signature based on oxidative stress-related genes (OSRGs) to assess patient outcomes and immune status. UCSC Xena ( http://xena.ucsc.edu/ ) and GEO ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) databases were used to obtain RNA-seq data and corresponding clinical information. The classification of OSRG subtypes was performed using consensus cluster. The oxidative stress related scoring (OSRS) model was established combining Lasso regression and multivariable Cox regression. The analysis of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and somatic mutation were carried out using the R package 'maftools'. Python package 'pySCENIC' was used to construct and analyze the transcription factor network. Additionally, immune infiltration was analyzed using R packages 'CIBERSORT' and 'ESTIMATE'. Three OSRG subgroups were identified and the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) among them were enriched in humoral immunity, cytokine communication and drug metabolism pathways. OSRS model was established based on the DEGs and revealed association with patients' overall survival, somatic mutations, immune statuses, and drug resistance.

"The intensification of global warming could precipitate the widespread dissemination of opportunistic pathogens, exerting a bidirectional strain on wildlife populations and potentially hastening the process of species extinction. In this study, we integrated indicators from peripheral blood single-cell transcriptome, behavior, and physiological indices in Chinese soft-shelled turtles (<i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>) to explore the impact of dual stress caused by bacterial infections and/or heatwaves on the turtles. Turtles were randomly divided into four groups based on constant temperature at 28 °C and heatwave exposure, as well as whether they were infected with bacteria (<i>Bacillus cereus</i>). Principal component analysis-based cell clustering revealed that the 14 cell clusters were classified into seven distinct cell types: erythrocytes, monocytes, thrombocytes, T cells, B cells, basophils, and heterophils. All cell types participated in the host immune response to heatwaves and bacterial infection, but these cells exhibited significant group-specific differences in their gene expression patterns. Bacterial infections and heatwaves altered turtle behavior and physiology indexes. The dual stresses inhibited the expression of antioxidant enzymes and immune genes, potentially jeopardizing turtle survival. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into peripheral blood cell profiles of Chinese soft-shelled turtles under different environmental conditions, enhancing the understanding of their immune responses and potential stressors.",Single-Cell Analysis,intensification global warming could precipitate widespread dissemination opportunistic pathogens exerting bidirectional strain wildlife populations potentially hastening process species extinction study integrated indicators peripheral blood singlecell transcriptome behavior physiological indices chinese softshelled turtles ipelodiscus sinensisi explore impact dual stress caused bacterial infections andor heatwaves turtles turtles randomly divided four groups based constant temperature c heatwave exposure well whether infected bacteria ibacillus cereusi principal component analysisbased cell clustering revealed cell clusters classified seven distinct cell types erythrocytes monocytes thrombocytes cells b cells basophils heterophils cell types participated host immune response heatwaves bacterial infection cells exhibited significant groupspecific differences gene expression patterns bacterial infections heatwaves altered turtle behavior physiology indexes dual stresses inhibited expression antioxidant enzymes immune genes potentially jeopardizing turtle survival overall study provides valuable insights peripheral blood cell profiles chinese softshelled turtles different environmental conditions enhancing understanding immune responses potential stressors,Single-Cell Analysis
"Emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of obesity-related depression (OD); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately explored. This study compared the microbial and transcriptional profiles between patients with OD and healthy individuals. The results revealed an enrichment of Anaerotruncus colihominis (A. colihominis) and glutamate metabolism-related genes in the OD group. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients with OD induced weight gain, compromised barrier function, and intensified depression-like behaviors in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. Microbial analysis in the mice feces corroborated the clinical findings. Single-cell RNA sequencing highlighted the pivotal role of the Efnb2-Ephb2 interaction in cell communication among colon epithelial and hippocampal neuron subtypes in OD mice. Notably, A. colihominis correlated with glutamate levels in the OD mice and patients. It produced glutamate through a glutamic acid metabolism-related DNA sequence, verified in an engineered Escherichia coli MG1655 strain. Both A. colihominis and glutamate reduced barrier proteins in colon epithelial cells and modulated cognitive proteins in neurons. Finally, A. colihominis treatment induced the Efnb2-Ephb2 interaction, exacerbating depression-like behaviors in germ-free HFD mice. Collectively, these findings reveal that A. colihominis and glutamate are potential intervention targets for OD treatment.",Single-Cell Analysis,emerging evidence implicates gut microbiota pathogenesis obesityrelated depression od however underlying molecular mechanisms remain inadequately explored study compared microbial transcriptional profiles patients od healthy individuals results revealed enrichment anaerotruncus colihominis colihominis glutamate metabolismrelated genes od group fecal microbiota transplantation fmt patients od induced weight gain compromised barrier function intensified depressionlike behaviors highfat diet hfd mice microbial analysis mice feces corroborated clinical findings singlecell rna sequencing highlighted pivotal role efnbephb interaction cell communication among colon epithelial hippocampal neuron subtypes od mice notably colihominis correlated glutamate levels od mice patients produced glutamate glutamic acid metabolismrelated dna sequence verified engineered escherichia coli mg strain colihominis glutamate reduced barrier proteins colon epithelial cells modulated cognitive proteins neurons finally colihominis treatment induced efnbephb interaction exacerbating depressionlike behaviors germfree hfd mice collectively findings reveal colihominis glutamate potential intervention targets od treatment,Single-Cell Analysis
"Recent data suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor (VEGFRi) can enhance the anti-tumor activity of the anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibody in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite stability (MSS). However, the comparison between this combination and standard third-line VEGFRi treatment is not performed, and reliable biomarkers are still lacking. We retrospectively enrolled MSS CRC patients receiving anti-PD-1 antibody plus VEGFRi (combination group, <i>n</i>=54) or VEGFRi alone (VEGFRi group, <i>n</i>=32), and their efficacy and safety were evaluated. We additionally examined the immune characteristics of the MSS CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, and an MSS CRC immune cell-related signature (MCICRS) that can be used to predict the clinical outcomes of MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy was developed and validated in our in-house cohort. Compared with VEGFRi alone, the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and VEGFRi exhibited a prolonged survival benefit (median progression-free survival: 4.4 vs. 2.0 months, <i>P</i>=0.0024; median overall survival: 10.2 vs. 5.2 months, <i>P</i>=0.0038) and a similar adverse event incidence. Through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis, we determined ten MSS CRC-enriched immune cell types and their spatial distribution, including naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T, regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17, exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T, cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T, proliferated CD8<sup>+</sup> T, natural killer (NK) cells, plasma, and classical and intermediate monocytes. Based on a systemic meta-analysis and ten machine learning algorithms, we obtained MCICRS, an independent risk factor for the prognosis of MSS CRC patients. Further analyses demonstrated that the low-MCICRS group presented a higher immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathway activation, and hence a significant relation with the superior efficacy of pan-cancer immunotherapy. More importantly, the predictive value of MCICRS in MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy was also validated with an in-house cohort. Anti-PD-1 antibody combined with VEGFRi presented an improved clinical benefit in MSS CRC with manageable toxicity. MCICRS could serve as a robust and promising tool to predict clinical outcomes for individual MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy.",Single-Cell Analysis,recent data suggest vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor vegfri enhance antitumor activity antiprogrammed cell death antipd antibody colorectal cancer crc microsatellite stability mss however comparison combination standard thirdline vegfri treatment performed reliable biomarkers still lacking retrospectively enrolled mss crc patients receiving antipd antibody plus vegfri combination group ini vegfri alone vegfri group ini efficacy safety evaluated additionally examined immune characteristics mss crc tumor microenvironment tme singlecell spatial transcriptomic data mss crc immune cellrelated signature mcicrs used predict clinical outcomes mss crc patients receiving immunotherapy developed validated inhouse cohort compared vegfri alone combination antipd antibody vegfri exhibited prolonged survival benefit median progressionfree survival vs months ipi median overall survival vs months ipi similar adverse event incidence singlecell spatial transcriptomic analysis determined ten mss crcenriched immune cell types spatial distribution including naive cdsupsup regulatory cdsupsup cdsupsup th exhausted cdsupsup cytotoxic cdsupsup proliferated cdsupsup natural killer nk cells plasma classical intermediate monocytes based systemic metaanalysis ten machine learning algorithms obtained mcicrs independent risk factor prognosis mss crc patients analyses demonstrated lowmcicrs group presented higher immune cell infiltration immunerelated pathway activation hence significant relation superior efficacy pancancer immunotherapy importantly predictive value mcicrs mss crc patients receiving immunotherapy also validated inhouse cohort antipd antibody combined vegfri presented improved clinical benefit mss crc manageable toxicity mcicrs could serve robust promising tool predict clinical outcomes individual mss crc patients receiving immunotherapy,Single-Cell Analysis
"Quantitative bioimaging of trace elements at the single-cell level is crucial for understanding cellular processes, including metal uptake and distribution. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has emerged as a gold standard for elemental bioimaging due to its high sensitivity and spatial resolution. However, calibration remains challenging due to the lack of homogeneous biological standards. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a gelatin-based calibration strategy optimized for Zn mapping in human parietal cells. By minimizing heterogeneity in gelatin standards and optimizing laser ablation conditions, the approach ensures accurate and reproducible results for cellular bioimaging. A gelatin-based calibration strategy for LA-ICP-MS was developed to quantify intracellular Zn at a single-cell level in human parietal cells. Preparation conditions for gelatin standards were optimized to minimize heterogeneity, eliminating the need for entire droplet ablation and significantly reducing analysis time. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to optimize laser ablation conditions and determine ablated volumes, ensuring quantitative Zn detection. The method demonstrated high linearity (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.99) and reproducibility. Application of the calibration strategy to ZnCl<sub>2</sub>-treated parietal cells revealed Zn distribution at a cellular level, visualized using a 5 μm laser beam. Integration with bright field imaging enabled the exclusion of apoptotic cells and debris, ensuring robust analysis. Validation with bulk ICP-MS showed excellent agreement, confirming the method's reliability and potential for high-resolution bioimaging. This work introduces a robust and reproducible calibration strategy for quantitative elemental bioimaging using LA-ICP-MS. It details the preparation of a gelatin matrix with a homogeneous element distribution, serving as an alternative to using biological material and significantly reducing analysis time.

"We investigated whether maternal exposure to phthalate and bisphenol A (BPA) mixtures is associated with eczema in children, as most studies have only addressed single chemical exposures. Nine phthalate metabolites and BPA were quantified in urine at gestational weeks 34-36 (n = 540) and total, inhalant, and food allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels (sx1, and fx5) were measured in serum from 4-year-old children of the LiNA cohort (n = 219). The association of prenatal exposure to phthalates and BPA, both single and mixed, with eczema and IgE was assessed in children stratified by atopy status. Three independent statistical models adjusted for covariates were used: logistic regression -also in the sex-stratified analysis-, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Moreover, an in silico toxicogenomic analysis was conducted to explore putative underlying mechanisms. The adjusted logistic regression showed that monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP; OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.29-6.4) and the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (2.09, 1.1-4.32) were significantly associated with eczema exclusively in atopic boys. The BKMR suggested a positive trend between chemical exposure and IgE values in the atopic subgroup. In the WQS model, the mixture' positive effect on eczema among atopic children was significant (1.90, 1.80-2.01) with MBzP (65.9%), monoethyl phthalate (13.3%), and BPA (10.9%) being the main contributors, which jointly modulate antibody-mediated immunity and inflammation gene pathways in the toxicogenomic profiling. Maternal exposure to mixtures of phthalates and BPA differentially impacts eczema risk among atopy-stratified children. The in silico chemical-gene interaction analysis in atopic children identified genes involved in immune cell activation and Ig production. Compared to non-atopic children, individual phthalates were significantly associated with eczema in atopic boys, suggesting that chemicals may have a larger effect size in predisposed populations.",Single-Cell Analysis,investigated whether maternal exposure phthalate bisphenol bpa mixtures associated eczema children studies addressed single chemical exposures nine phthalate metabolites bpa quantified urine gestational weeks n total inhalant food allergenspecific immunoglobulin ige levels sx fx measured serum yearold children lina cohort n association prenatal exposure phthalates bpa single mixed eczema ige assessed children stratified atopy status three independent statistical models adjusted covariates used logistic regression also sexstratified analysis weighted quantile sum wqs regression bayesian kernel machine regression bkmr moreover silico toxicogenomic analysis conducted explore putative underlying mechanisms adjusted logistic regression showed monobenzyl phthalate mbzp ci sum diethylhexyl phthalate metabolites significantly associated eczema exclusively atopic boys bkmr suggested positive trend chemical exposure ige values atopic subgroup wqs model mixture positive effect eczema among atopic children significant mbzp monoethyl phthalate bpa main contributors jointly modulate antibodymediated immunity inflammation gene pathways toxicogenomic profiling maternal exposure mixtures phthalates bpa differentially impacts eczema risk among atopystratified children silico chemicalgene interaction analysis atopic children identified genes involved immune cell activation ig production compared nonatopic children individual phthalates significantly associated eczema atopic boys suggesting chemicals may larger effect size predisposed populations,Single-Cell Analysis
"Heterozygous histone H3.3K27M mutation is a primary oncogenic driver of Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG). H3.3K27M inhibits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase activity, leading to global reduction and redistribution of the repressive H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). This epigenomic rewiring is thought to promote gliomagenesis, but the precise role of K27M in gene regulation and tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. We established isogenic DMG patient-derived cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to create H3.3 wild-type (WT), H3.3K27M, and combinations with EZH2 and EZH1 co-deletion, thereby eliminating PRC2 function and H3K27me3. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis revealed that K27M exerts a novel epigenetic effect independent of PRC2 inhibition. While PRC2 loss led to widespread gene induction including HOX gene clusters, and activation of biological pathways, K27M induced a balanced gene deregulation with an overall repressive effect on pathway activity. Genes uniquely affected by K27M, independent of PRC2 loss, showed concordant changes in chromatin accessibility, with upregulated genes becoming more accessible. Importantly, xenografts of H3.3K27M/EZH1/2 WT cells formed tumors, whereas /EZH1/2 knockout cells did not, demonstrating a PRC2-independent role of K27M in tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal that the H3.3K27M mutation alters chromatin accessibility and uniquely deregulates gene expression independent of H3K27 methylation loss. These PRC2-independent functions of K27M contribute to changes in biological pathway activity and are necessary for tumor development, highlighting novel mechanisms of K27M-driven gliomagenesis.",CRISPR Gene Editing,heterozygous histone hkm mutation primary oncogenic driver diffuse midline glioma dmg hkm inhibits polycomb repressive complex prc methyltransferase activity leading global reduction redistribution repressive h lysine trimethylation hkme epigenomic rewiring thought promote gliomagenesis precise role km gene regulation tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood established isogenic dmg patientderived cell lines using crisprcas editing create h wildtype wt hkm combinations ezh ezh codeletion thereby eliminating prc function hkme rnaseq atacseq analysis revealed km exerts novel epigenetic effect independent prc inhibition prc loss led widespread gene induction including hox gene clusters activation biological pathways km induced balanced gene deregulation overall repressive effect pathway activity genes uniquely affected km independent prc loss showed concordant changes chromatin accessibility upregulated genes becoming accessible importantly xenografts hkmezh wt cells formed tumors whereas ezh knockout cells demonstrating prcindependent role km tumorigenesis findings reveal hkm mutation alters chromatin accessibility uniquely deregulates gene expression independent hk methylation loss prcindependent functions km contribute changes biological pathway activity necessary tumor development highlighting novel mechanisms kmdriven gliomagenesis,CRISPR Gene Editing

"Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing viral replication in the blood, HIV persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and causes chronic neurocognitive impairment, a hallmark of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). This review looks at the complex interactions among HIV, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and the roles of viral proteins, immune cell trafficking, and pro-inflammatory mediators in establishing and maintaining latent viral reservoirs in the CNS, particularly microglia and astrocytes. Key findings show disruption of the BBB, monocyte infiltration, and activation of CNS-resident cells by HIV proteins like Tat and gp120, contributing to the neuroinflammatory environment and neuronal damage. Advances in epigenetic regulation of latency have identified targets like histone modifications and DNA methylation, and new therapeutic strategies like latency-reversing agents (LRAs), gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9), and nanoparticle-based drug delivery also offer hope. While we have made significant progress in understanding the molecular basis of HIV persistence in the CNS, overcoming the challenges of BBB penetration and neuroinflammation is key to developing effective therapies. Further research into combination therapies and novel drug delivery systems will help improve outcomes for HAND patients and bring us closer to a functional cure for HIV.",CRISPR Gene Editing,despite success antiretroviral therapy art suppressing viral replication blood hiv persists central nervous system cns causes chronic neurocognitive impairment hallmark hivassociated neurocognitive disorders hand review looks complex interactions among hiv bloodbrain barrier bbb neuroinflammation roles viral proteins immune cell trafficking proinflammatory mediators establishing maintaining latent viral reservoirs cns particularly microglia astrocytes key findings show disruption bbb monocyte infiltration activation cnsresident cells hiv proteins like tat gp contributing neuroinflammatory environment neuronal damage advances epigenetic regulation latency identified targets like histone modifications dna methylation new therapeutic strategies like latencyreversing agents lras gene editing crisprcas nanoparticlebased drug delivery also offer hope made significant progress understanding molecular basis hiv persistence cns overcoming challenges bbb penetration neuroinflammation key developing effective therapies research combination therapies novel drug delivery systems help improve outcomes hand patients bring us closer functional cure hiv,CRISPR Gene Editing

"Aneuploidy is increasingly recognized globally as a common cause of miscarriage among expectant mothers. The existing prenatal screening techniques for detecting aneuploidy have several limitations. The ability to diagnose aneuploidy early in a non-invasive manner is not feasible with the current screening methods, as they may produce false positive or false negative results. Recently, the widely used gene editing tool CRISPR/Cas has shown great promise in diagnostics. This review summarizes the prenatal screening tests used in the first trimester to assess aneuploidy conditions. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of molecular diagnostic tests, including the benefits and challenges of CRISPR/Cas-based trisomy detection. Thus, the proposed prenatal screening using CRISPR/Cas could provide significant benefits to expectant mothers by potentially enabling the early diagnosis of trisomy, helping to prevent miscarriage and birth defects.

"High quality stands as a pivotal competitive edge in the rice industry. Optimizing amylose content (AC) and the physicochemical properties of endosperm starch by regulating the <i>Wx</i> gene is crucial for enhancing rice grain quality. In this study, we created a novel <i>Wx<sup>b-d25</sup></i> allele by deleting a 25 bp segment (-26 to -2) within the <i>Wx</i> core promoter using CRISPR/Cas9. Compared with the wild type and the previously reported <i>Wx<sup>b-i1</sup></i>, <i>Wx<sup>b-d25</sup></i> exhibited no significant changes in agronomic traits. However, its grains displayed temperature-dependent variations in AC and altered transparency and viscosity characteristics, holding the potential to synergistically improve both the eating and cooking quality (ECQ) and appearance quality (AQ) of rice. Further studies demonstrated that this promoter modification, by partially disrupting the transcription initiator, significantly downregulated the original <i>Wx</i>-01 transcript and generated a novel <i>Wx</i> transcript (ONT.7395.1) in <i>Wx<sup>b-d25</sup></i> grains. Despite its low expression abundance, the ONT.7395.1 transcript could be completely processed into mature <i>Wx</i> mRNA. The combined effects of the dual transcripts resulted in significantly increased <i>Wx</i> gene expression and AC in <i>Wx<sup>b-d25</sup></i> grains under conventional cultivation conditions.

"The CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as one of the most promising gene-editing technologies in biology. However, off-target effects remain a significant challenge. While recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of models for off-target prediction, these models often fail to fully leverage sequence pair information. Furthermore, as the models' parameter sizes increase, so do their complexities, limiting their practical applicability. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-feature independent encoding method, which encodes the gRNA-DNA sequence pair into three distinct feature matrices to minimize information loss. Additionally, we propose a lightweight hybrid deep learning framework, CRISPR-MFH, that integrates multi-scale separable convolutions and hybrid attention mechanisms for efficient and accurate off-target prediction. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed encoding method effectively captures critical features and that CRISPR-MFH outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters across multiple evaluation metrics.

"The use of CRISPR to knockdown or knockout genes is a powerful tool for understanding the specific role of a gene in disease development. However, it can cause many unanticipated changes to the transcriptome that are not detected by DNA amplification and Sanger sequencing of the target site. Various RNA-sequencing techniques can be used to identify these changes and effectively gauge the full impact of the CRISPR knockout, thereby providing a means of selecting appropriate clones for further experimentation. RNA-seq data from 4 CRISPR knockout experiments were analyzed and techniques developed to both confirm the success of the CRISPR modifications and identify potential issues. A broad-based analysis of RNA-sequencing data identified many CRISPR-based changes not identified by PCR amplification of DNA around the CRISPR target site. These changes included an inter-chromosomal fusion event, exon skipping, chromosomal truncation, and the unintentional transcriptional modification and amplification of a neighboring gene. The inadvertent modifications identified by the evaluation of 4 CRISPR experiments highlight the value of using RNA-seq to identify transcriptional changes to cells altered by CRISPR, many of which cannot be recognized by evaluating DNA alone.

"Enzymatic browning and cold-induced sweetening (CIS) affect the post-harvest quality of potato tubers. Browning is caused by polyphenol oxidase 2 (PPO2), which is activated by mechanical damage during harvest and storage. CIS occurs when vacuolar invertase converts sucrose into reducing sugars, which react with amino acids during frying, forming brown pigments and acrylamide. While cold storage prevents sprouting and disease, it also increases vacuolar invertase expression, leading to quality loss. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we developed gene-edited potato lines with improved resistance to browning and CIS. Line 6A (cv. Atlantic) and E03-3 (cv. Spunta) exhibited complete vacuolar invertase (<i>InvVac</i>) knockout, maintaining chip quality for at least 60 days at 4 °C. Line 6A, renamed PIRU INTA, was tested in field trials and preserved frying quality for up to 90 days under cold storage. PIRU INTA is currently undergoing registration as a new variety. Additionally, lines E04-5B and E03-3 (cv. Spunta) showed partial <i>PPO2</i> gene edits, reducing enzymatic browning by 80% and 40%, respectively.

"The direct-seeded rice (DSR) system is poised to become the dominant rice cultivation method due to its advantages, including reduced water usage, less labor requirements, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and improved adaptation to climate change. However, weeds, particularly jungle rice (<i>Echinochloa colona</i>), significantly hinder DSR and cause substantial yield losses. This study aimed to develop rice cultivars competitive against jungle rice through selective breeding, focusing on early seed germination (ESG) and seedling vigor (ESV). We utilized 181 early-backcross selective introgression breeding lines (EB-SILs) developed using Green Super Rice (GSR) technology by backcrossing Weed Tolerant Rice1 (WTR1) with three donor parents, Haoannong, Cheng Hui 448, and Y134. Using the tunable genotyping-by-sequencing (tGBS<sup>®</sup>, Data2Bio Technologies, Ames, IA, USA) method, we identified 3971 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that facilitated the mapping of 19 novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with weed competitiveness-eight linked to ESG traits and eleven to ESV traits. Notably, all QTLs were novel except <i>qRPH</i>1, linked to relative plant height at 14 and 21 days after sowing. Key QTLs were located on chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12. Candidate genes identified within these QTLs are implicated in the plant's response to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Our findings enhance the understanding of the genetic basis for ESG and ESV traits critical for weed competitiveness, supporting marker-assisted and genomic selection approaches for breeding improved rice varieties. Furthermore, this research lays the groundwork for employing gene expression, cloning, and CRISPR editing strategies to combat jungle rice, with potential applications for other weed species and contributing to effective integrated weed management in the DSR system.",CRISPR Gene Editing,directseeded rice dsr system poised become dominant rice cultivation method due advantages including reduced water usage less labor requirements decreased greenhouse gas emissions improved adaptation climate change however weeds particularly jungle rice iechinochloa colonai significantly hinder dsr cause substantial yield losses study aimed develop rice cultivars competitive jungle rice selective breeding focusing early seed germination esg seedling vigor esv utilized earlybackcross selective introgression breeding lines ebsils developed using green super rice gsr technology backcrossing weed tolerant rice wtr three donor parents haoannong cheng hui using tunable genotypingbysequencing tgbssupsup databio technologies ames ia usa method identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms snps facilitated mapping novel quantitative trait loci qtls associated weed competitivenesseight linked esg traits eleven esv traits notably qtls novel except iqrphi linked relative plant height days sowing key qtls located chromosomes candidate genes identified within qtls implicated plants response various abiotic biotic stresses findings enhance understanding genetic basis esg esv traits critical weed competitiveness supporting markerassisted genomic selection approaches breeding improved rice varieties furthermore research lays groundwork employing gene expression cloning crispr editing strategies combat jungle rice potential applications weed species contributing effective integrated weed management dsr system,CRISPR Gene Editing
"This study aims to enhance membrane protein production in HEK293T cells through genetic modification. HEK293T cells are used for recombinant protein and viral vector production due to their human origin and post-translational modification capabilities. This study explores enhancing membrane protein production in these cells by deleting the C-terminal of the ATF6B gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of C-terminal deletion of the ATF6B gene on membrane protein production in HEK293T cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. To identify effective gene targets, sgRNAs were initially designed against multiple UPR-related genes, including ATF6A, IRE1A, IRE1B, PERK, and ATF6B. Among them, ATF6B was selected as the primary target for further investigation due to its superior editing efficiency. The efficiency of sgRNAs was evaluated using the T7E1 assay, and sequencing was performed to verify gene editing patterns. Membrane proteins were extracted from both ATF6B C-terminally deleted (ATF6B-ΔC) and wild-type (WT) cell lines for comparison. Flow cytometry was employed to assess membrane protein production by analyzing GFP expression in Membrane-GFP-expressing cells. HEK293T cells with C-terminally deleted ATF6B (ATF6B-ΔC) significantly increased membrane protein production by approximately 40 ± 17.6% compared to WT cells (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Sequencing revealed 11, 14, 1, and 10 bp deletions in the ATF6B-ΔC edited cells, which disrupted exon sequences, induced exon skipping, and introduced premature stop codons, suppressing normal protein expression. Flow cytometry confirmed a 23.9 ± 4.2% increase in GFP intensity in ATF6B-ΔC cells, corroborating the enhanced membrane protein production. These findings suggest that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated C-terminal deletion of the ATF6B gene can effectively enhance membrane protein production in HEK293T cells by activating the unfolded protein response pathway and improving the cell's capacity to manage misfolded proteins. This strategy presents significant potential for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, where efficient membrane protein production is essential for drug development and various applications.",CRISPR Gene Editing,study aims enhance membrane protein production hekt cells genetic modification hekt cells used recombinant protein viral vector production due human origin posttranslational modification capabilities study explores enhancing membrane protein production cells deleting cterminal atfb gene using crisprcas technology objective research investigate effect cterminal deletion atfb gene membrane protein production hekt cells using crisprcas technology identify effective gene targets sgrnas initially designed multiple uprrelated genes including atfa irea ireb perk atfb among atfb selected primary target investigation due superior editing efficiency efficiency sgrnas evaluated using te assay sequencing performed verify gene editing patterns membrane proteins extracted atfb cterminally deleted atfbc wildtype wt cell lines comparison flow cytometry employed assess membrane protein production analyzing gfp expression membranegfpexpressing cells hekt cells cterminally deleted atfb atfbc significantly increased membrane protein production approximately compared wt cells ipi sequencing revealed bp deletions atfbc edited cells disrupted exon sequences induced exon skipping introduced premature stop codons suppressing normal protein expression flow cytometry confirmed increase gfp intensity atfbc cells corroborating enhanced membrane protein production findings suggest crisprcasmediated cterminal deletion atfb gene effectively enhance membrane protein production hekt cells activating unfolded protein response pathway improving cells capacity manage misfolded proteins strategy presents significant potential biotechnology pharmaceutical industries efficient membrane protein production essential drug development various applications,CRISPR Gene Editing
"CRISPR technologies have revolutionized strain engineering of Aspergillus species, and drastically increased the ease and speed at which genomic modifications can be performed. One of the advantages of CRISPR technologies is the possibility of rapid strain engineering using multiplex experiments. This can be achieved by using a set of different guiding RNA molecules (gRNA) to target multiple loci in the same experiment. Two major challenges in such experiments are firstly, the delivery of multiple guides simultaneously, and secondly, ensuring that each target locus is cut efficiently by the CRISPR nuclease. The CRISPR nuclease Cas12a, also known as Cpf1, presents a unique advantage to bypass this challenge. Specifically, and unlike Cas9, Cpf1 is able to release several gRNAs from a common precursor RNA molecule through its own RNase activity, eliminating the need for elements such as ribozymes or tRNA machinery for gRNA maturation. This feature sets the stage for much more straightforward construction of vectors for the delivery of many gRNAs, which in turn allows each locus to be targeted by multiple gRNAs to increase the odds of successfully inducing a break in the DNA. Here we present a toolbox that can be used to assemble plasmids containing a gRNA multiplex expression cassette, which is able to express a multi gRNA precursor. The precursor can be processed via Cpf1 RNase activity to produce multiple functional gRNAs in vivo. Using our setup, we have constructed plasmids that are able to deliver up to ten gRNAs. In addition, we show that three simultaneous deletions can be introduced robustly in Aspergillus niger by targeting each gene with several gRNAs, without prior gRNA validation or the use of genomically integrated selection markers. In this study we have established an efficient system for the construction of CRISPR-Cpf1 vectors that are able to deliver a large number of gRNAs for multiplex genome editing in Aspergillus species. Our strategy allows multiple specific genomic modifications to be performed in a time frame of less than two weeks, and we envision this will be able to speed up cell factory construction efforts significantly.",CRISPR Gene Editing,crispr technologies revolutionized strain engineering aspergillus species drastically increased ease speed genomic modifications performed one advantages crispr technologies possibility rapid strain engineering using multiplex experiments achieved using set different guiding rna molecules grna target multiple loci experiment two major challenges experiments firstly delivery multiple guides simultaneously secondly ensuring target locus cut efficiently crispr nuclease crispr nuclease casa also known cpf presents unique advantage bypass challenge specifically unlike cas cpf able release several grnas common precursor rna molecule rnase activity eliminating need elements ribozymes trna machinery grna maturation feature sets stage much straightforward construction vectors delivery many grnas turn allows locus targeted multiple grnas increase odds successfully inducing break dna present toolbox used assemble plasmids containing grna multiplex expression cassette able express multi grna precursor precursor processed via cpf rnase activity produce multiple functional grnas vivo using setup constructed plasmids able deliver ten grnas addition show three simultaneous deletions introduced robustly aspergillus niger targeting gene several grnas without prior grna validation use genomically integrated selection markers study established efficient system construction crisprcpf vectors able deliver large number grnas multiplex genome editing aspergillus species strategy allows multiple specific genomic modifications performed time frame less two weeks envision able speed cell factory construction efforts significantly,CRISPR Gene Editing
"The content of terpenoids in tobacco can alter its resistance to TMV. NtSPS1, a pivotal structural gene in tobacco, is capable to regulate the terpenoid content. In this study, we investigated the effect of NtSPS1 knockout in HD on the content of terpenoids and the anti-TMV activity of this mutant using gene editing, widely targeted metabolomics, network pharmacology, and molecular docking. 48 terpenoids (six up-regulated and five down-regulated) in NtSPS1 knockout tobacco compared with WT leaves. Notably, solanesol was remarkable downregulation which was lowered by fourfold and compounds 1 (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 18.2), 8 (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 16.7) were significant upregulation between the mutants and wild-type line leaves.

"Maize (Zea mays L.), a cornerstone of global food security, faces significant challenges due to drought stress, which disrupts its growth, development, and productivity. This review synthesizes advances in our understanding of drought stress memory, a mechanism that enables maize to ""remember"" prior drought exposure through transcriptional, epigenetic, and physiological pathways. Key regulators, including transcription factors (ZmEREB24 and ZmNF-YC12) and epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation and histone acetylation), orchestrate stress-responsive pathways that ensure rapid adaptation to recurrent drought events. Complementing these molecular mechanisms, physiological adaptations, such as optimized root and leaf architecture, enhanced water-use efficiency, and antioxidant defenses, further strengthen drought tolerance. Practical applications, including molecular priming techniques (e.g., osmopriming, hydropriming, nanoparticles) and advanced genetic tools (CRISPR/Cas9, GWAS), promise scalable solutions for breeding drought-resilient maize varieties.

Interestingly, ABCC6 is predominantly expressed in the liver tissue, leading to the hypothesis that PXE is a metabolic disorder. We developed a genome-editing system targeting ABCC6 in human immortalized hepatocytes (HepIms) for further investigations. The HepIms were transfected with an <i>ABCC6</i>-specific clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR-Cas9) genome-editing plasmid, resulting in the identification of a heterozygous (<i>ht<sup>ABCC6</sup></i>HepIm) and a compound heterozygous (<i>cht<sup>ABCC6</sup></i>HepIm) clone. These clones were analyzed for key markers associated with the PXE pathobiochemistry. Hints of impaired lipid trafficking, defects in the extracellular matrix remodeling, the induction of calcification inhibitor expression, and the down regulation of senescence and inflammatory markers in <i>ABCC6</i>-deficienct HepIms were found. Our <i>ABCC6</i> knock-out model of HepIms provides a valuable tool for studying the metabolic characteristics of PXE in vitro.

"Current medicine could benefit from gene and cell therapies for genetic defects, cancer, and degenerative disorders. These therapies modify genetic material or biological components. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, stem cell, and CAR-T treatments are examples. Complex products need rigorous regulations to ensure quality, efficacy, and patient safety. This paper discusses international gene and cell-based treatment regulatory regimes, highlighting key issues and recent developments. It also includes gene and cell-based therapy classes and mechanisms. The publications on gene and cell therapy challenges and their regulatory approvals in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, and China were collected over the last 20 years from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and analyzed to determine the differences. Gene treatments correct genetic defects or disease processes by adding, removing, or changing cell genetic information. In contrast, cell-based therapies restore damaged tissues with modified or unmodified cells. Highly customized and patient-specific drugs make regulatory monitoring challenging. US FDA CBER controls gene and cell-based therapies. Before clinical trials, these biologic drugs must file BLAs for market approval and INDs. FDA's Breakthrough Therapy and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designations accelerate biological development. The EMA oversees EU Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. ATMP quality, safety, and efficacy are CAT's top priorities. The Conditional Marketing Authorization process expedites access to life-threatening disease medicines while the MAA regulates them. Japan's PMDA's Conditional Time-Limited Approval for regenerative medicines provides early commercialization and rigorous post-market supervision. Similarly, each country has adopted some ways to expedite the approval of biologicals. Geneediting drugs require specialized methods, long-term follow-up, and better safety to avoid offtarget effects. GMPs ensure production uniformity, sterility, and safety, complicating manufacturing and quality control.

"Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder characterized by hypoplasia of facial tissue that is often asymmetric. Affected tissues typically include the ears (external and internal), mandible, and maxilla, but various extracranial anomalies have also been reported. Loss-of-function variants in the <i>SF3B2</i> gene have recently been reported in 8 cases of CFM, representing one of the more common genetic causes identified to date. To better define the full phenotypic spectrum associated with variants in <i>SF3B2</i>, we report novel loss-of-function variants in <i>SF3B2</i> in 5 new families with CFM. Furthermore, to determine the mechanism by which <i>SF3B2</i> loss-of-function perturbs craniofacial development, we established <i>sf3b2</i>-null mutant zebrafish, which exhibited severe deficiencies in craniofacial cartilage and bone progenitors due to elevated apoptosis and reduced proliferation of cranial neural crest cells. In addition, we generated a heterozygous truncating variant of <i>SF3B2</i> in human induced pluripotent stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Differentiation of these cells into neural crest cells was accompanied by increased cell death and reduced proliferation. RNA sequencing of <i>sf3b2</i> mutant zebrafish revealed widespread disruption of mRNA splicing, including <i>mdm2</i>, a key regulator of Tp53-mediated apoptosis. Genetic inhibition of <i>tp53</i> in <i>sf3b2</i> mutants demonstrated that <i>tp53</i> inhibition reduces early cell death but does not improve proliferation or craniofacial cartilage development. Therefore, our functional studies indicate that widespread mRNA splicing disruption, in addition to Tp53-dependent cell death, contributes to the craniofacial features observed in <i>SF3B2</i>-related CFM.",CRISPR Gene Editing,craniofacial microsomia cfm genetically phenotypically heterogeneous disorder characterized hypoplasia facial tissue often asymmetric affected tissues typically include ears external internal mandible maxilla various extracranial anomalies also reported lossoffunction variants isfbi gene recently reported cases cfm representing one common genetic causes identified date better define full phenotypic spectrum associated variants isfbi report novel lossoffunction variants isfbi new families cfm furthermore determine mechanism isfbi lossoffunction perturbs craniofacial development established isfbinull mutant zebrafish exhibited severe deficiencies craniofacial cartilage bone progenitors due elevated apoptosis reduced proliferation cranial neural crest cells addition generated heterozygous truncating variant isfbi human induced pluripotent stem cells using crisprcas gene editing differentiation cells neural crest cells accompanied increased cell death reduced proliferation rna sequencing isfbi mutant zebrafish revealed widespread disruption mrna splicing including imdmi key regulator tpmediated apoptosis genetic inhibition itpi isfbi mutants demonstrated itpi inhibition reduces early cell death improve proliferation craniofacial cartilage development therefore functional studies indicate widespread mrna splicing disruption addition tpdependent cell death contributes craniofacial features observed isfbirelated cfm,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Recent advances in the field of genome editing offer a promising avenue for targeted trait improvements in fruit trees. However, the predominant method taken for genome editing in citrus (and other fruit trees) involves the time-consuming tissue culture approach, thereby prolonging the overall citrus breeding process and subjecting it to the drawbacks associated with somaclonal variation. In this study, we introduce an in planta approach for genome editing in soil-grown citrus plants via direct transformation of young seedlings. Our editing system, abbreviated here as IPGEC (in planta genome editing in citrus), is designed to transiently co-express three key gene groups in citrus tissue via Agrobacterium tumefaciens: (i) a genome-editing catalytic group, (ii) a shoot induction and regeneration group, and (iii) a T-DNA enhanced delivery group. This integrated system significantly improves de novo shoot induction and regeneration efficiency of edited tissue. By incorporating single-guides RNA's (sgRNA's) targeting the carotenoid biosynthetic gene PHYTOENE DESATURASE (CsPDS), the IPGEC system effectively produced mutated albino shoots, confirming its ability to generate homozygous/biallelic genome-edited plants. By using high throughput screening, we provide evidence that transgene-free genome-edited plants could be obtained following the IPGEC approach. Our findings further suggest that the efficiency of specific developmental regulators in inducing transformation and regeneration rates may be cultivar-specific and therefore needs to be optimized per cultivar. Finally, targeted breeding for specific trait improvements in already successful cultivars is likely to revolutionize fruit tree breeding and will pave the way for accelerating the development of high-quality citrus cultivars.",CRISPR Gene Editing,recent advances field genome editing offer promising avenue targeted trait improvements fruit trees however predominant method taken genome editing citrus fruit trees involves timeconsuming tissue culture approach thereby prolonging overall citrus breeding process subjecting drawbacks associated somaclonal variation study introduce planta approach genome editing soilgrown citrus plants via direct transformation young seedlings editing system abbreviated ipgec planta genome editing citrus designed transiently coexpress three key gene groups citrus tissue via agrobacterium tumefaciens genomeediting catalytic group ii shoot induction regeneration group iii tdna enhanced delivery group integrated system significantly improves de novo shoot induction regeneration efficiency edited tissue incorporating singleguides rnas sgrnas targeting carotenoid biosynthetic gene phytoene desaturase cspds ipgec system effectively produced mutated albino shoots confirming ability generate homozygousbiallelic genomeedited plants using high throughput screening provide evidence transgenefree genomeedited plants could obtained following ipgec approach findings suggest efficiency specific developmental regulators inducing transformation regeneration rates may cultivarspecific therefore needs optimized per cultivar finally targeted breeding specific trait improvements already successful cultivars likely revolutionize fruit tree breeding pave way accelerating development highquality citrus cultivars,CRISPR Gene Editing
"In this study, a novel nonylphenol (NP)-degrading bacterium, Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana CH, was isolated from wastewater treatment plant effluent. Phylogenetic analysis showed its close relationship to P. mexicana AMX 26BT. The strain displayed chemotaxis toward NP, with Mcp24 as the key chemoreceptor. The Mcp24 deletion mutant (CH- 1) had weaker chemotaxis and NP degradation (over 30% lower in solution and 8% lower in sludge than the wild type). In vitro, Mcp15's C-terminal pentapeptide DWQEF was methylated by CheR. Using CRISPR, this pentapeptide was added to Mcp24 to create CH- 2. CH- 2 showed better NP chemotaxis (17% higher in plate assays and 39% higher in capillary assays) and higher NP degradation rates (23.5% and 24.2% higher in solution and sludge, respectively). These findings demonstrate that NP acts as a bacterial chemoattractant, with Mcp24 as the receptor. Enhancing Mcp24's C-terminal pentapeptide improves chemotaxis and degradation efficiency, representing a significant advancement in bioremediation by strengthening bacterial responses to pollutants.",CRISPR Gene Editing,study novel nonylphenol npdegrading bacterium pseudoxanthomonas mexicana ch isolated wastewater treatment plant effluent phylogenetic analysis showed close relationship p mexicana amx bt strain displayed chemotaxis toward np mcp key chemoreceptor mcp deletion mutant ch weaker chemotaxis np degradation lower solution lower sludge wild type vitro mcps cterminal pentapeptide dwqef methylated cher using crispr pentapeptide added mcp create ch ch showed better np chemotaxis higher plate assays higher capillary assays higher np degradation rates higher solution sludge respectively findings demonstrate np acts bacterial chemoattractant mcp receptor enhancing mcps cterminal pentapeptide improves chemotaxis degradation efficiency representing significant advancement bioremediation strengthening bacterial responses pollutants,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Genetic screens with barcoded PlasmoGEM vectors have identified thousands of Plasmodium berghei gene functions in haploid blood stages, gametocytes and liver stages. However, the formation of diploid cells by fertilisation has hindered similar research on the parasites' mosquito stages. In this study, we develop a scalable genetic system that uses barcoded gene targeting vectors equipped with a CRISPR-mediated homing mechanism to generate homozygous loss-of-function mutants after one parent introduces a modified allele into the zygote. To achieve this, we use vectors additionally expressing a target gene specific gRNA. When integrated into one of the parental alleles it directs Cas9 to the intact allele after fertilisation, leading to its disruption. This homing strategy is 90% effective at generating homozygous gene editing of a fluorescence-tagged reporter locus in the oocyst. A pilot screen identifies PBANKA_0916000 as a chloroquine resistance transporter-like protein (CRTL) essential for oocyst growth and sporogony, pointing to an unexpected importance for malaria transmission of the poorly understood digestive vacuole of the oocyst that contains hemozoin granules. Homing screens provide a method for the systematic discovery of malaria transmission genes whose first essential functions are after fertilisation in the bloodmeal, enabling their potential as targets for transmission-blocking interventions to be assessed.",CRISPR Gene Editing,genetic screens barcoded plasmogem vectors identified thousands plasmodium berghei gene functions haploid blood stages gametocytes liver stages however formation diploid cells fertilisation hindered similar research parasites mosquito stages study develop scalable genetic system uses barcoded gene targeting vectors equipped crisprmediated homing mechanism generate homozygous lossoffunction mutants one parent introduces modified allele zygote achieve use vectors additionally expressing target gene specific grna integrated one parental alleles directs cas intact allele fertilisation leading disruption homing strategy effective generating homozygous gene editing fluorescencetagged reporter locus oocyst pilot screen identifies pbanka chloroquine resistance transporterlike protein crtl essential oocyst growth sporogony pointing unexpected importance malaria transmission poorly understood digestive vacuole oocyst contains hemozoin granules homing screens provide method systematic discovery malaria transmission genes whose first essential functions fertilisation bloodmeal enabling potential targets transmissionblocking interventions assessed,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Its progression is intricately associated with the dynamic regulation of autophagy and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which play crucial roles in mRNA stability, alternative splicing, and cellular stress responses. This review aims to systematically analyze the mechanisms through which RBPs and autophagy contribute to lung cancer progression and explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. We reviewed recent studies on the molecular mechanisms by which RBPs regulate tumor proliferation, metabolic adaptation, and their interaction with autophagy. The review also examines the dual roles of autophagy in lung cancer, highlighting its context-dependent effects on cell survival and death. The interactions and regulatory networks between RBPs and autophagy involve multiple levels of regulation. RBPs can directly influence autophagy processes and act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate mRNA stability. The modulation of RBPs affects the expression of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) and autophagosome formation. Additionally, RBPs participate in complex regulatory interactions with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and other proteins. This review proposes innovative therapeutic strategies that combine RBP-targeting approaches (e.g., small molecule inhibitors, CRISPR gene editing) with autophagy modulators (e.g., mTOR inhibitors, chloroquine) to enhance treatment efficacy. Nanoparticle drug delivery systems and epigenetic regulation offer further opportunities for targeted interventions. This review lays a theoretical foundation for advancing lung cancer research and provides novel insights into synergistic therapies that target both RBPs and autophagy to improve treatment outcomes for lung cancer.",CRISPR Gene Editing,lung cancer remains leading cause cancerrelated mortality worldwide progression intricately associated dynamic regulation autophagy rnabinding proteins rbps play crucial roles mrna stability alternative splicing cellular stress responses review aims systematically analyze mechanisms rbps autophagy contribute lung cancer progression explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting pathways reviewed recent studies molecular mechanisms rbps regulate tumor proliferation metabolic adaptation interaction autophagy review also examines dual roles autophagy lung cancer highlighting contextdependent effects cell survival death interactions regulatory networks rbps autophagy involve multiple levels regulation rbps directly influence autophagy processes act microrna mirna sponges regulate mrna stability modulation rbps affects expression autophagyrelated genes atgs autophagosome formation additionally rbps participate complex regulatory interactions noncoding rnas ncrnas including long noncoding rnas lncrnas circular rnas circrnas proteins review proposes innovative therapeutic strategies combine rbptargeting approaches eg small molecule inhibitors crispr gene editing autophagy modulators eg mtor inhibitors chloroquine enhance treatment efficacy nanoparticle drug delivery systems epigenetic regulation offer opportunities targeted interventions review lays theoretical foundation advancing lung cancer research provides novel insights synergistic therapies target rbps autophagy improve treatment outcomes lung cancer,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is still an ongoing public health issue worldwide. The most efficient tool in preventing HBV infection remains vaccination and significant efforts have been made in the last decade to improve current HBV vaccines. Owing to the strict HBV tropism for the human liver, developing animal models for preclinical screening of vaccine candidates is extremely challenging. To date, there are only a few reports regarding the use of humanized mouse models for the evaluation of the immunogenic properties of viral antigens. Previously we showed that a <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>-produced HBV-S/preS1<sup>16-42</sup> antigen elicited strong HBV-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice. In the current study, we used immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup> Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjl</sup>/SzJ (NSG) mice as recipients of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), to evaluate the immunogenicity of the recently developed chimeric HBV immunogen produced in CRISPR/Cas9-edited <i>N. benthamiana</i>, under more ""humanized"" conditions. Analysis of the immune response in NSG mice immunized with the chimeric antigen demonstrated induction of virus infection-neutralizing antibodies, indicating activation of antigen-specific B cells. The ability of hPBMCs-engrafted NSG mice to mount specific humoral immune responses after immunization with viral antigens supports this animal model as a promising tool for pre-clinical evaluation of human vaccine antigens.",CRISPR Gene Editing,hepatitis b virus hbv infection still ongoing public health issue worldwide efficient tool preventing hbv infection remains vaccination significant efforts made last decade improve current hbv vaccines owing strict hbv tropism human liver developing animal models preclinical screening vaccine candidates extremely challenging date reports regarding use humanized mouse models evaluation immunogenic properties viral antigens previously showed inicotiana benthamianaiproduced hbvspressupsup antigen elicited strong hbvspecific immune responses balbc mice current study used immunodeficient nodcgprkdcsupscidsup ilrgsuptmwjlsupszj nsg mice recipients human peripheral blood mononuclear cells hpbmcs evaluate immunogenicity recently developed chimeric hbv immunogen produced crisprcasedited benthamianai humanized conditions analysis immune response nsg mice immunized chimeric antigen demonstrated induction virus infectionneutralizing antibodies indicating activation antigenspecific b cells ability hpbmcsengrafted nsg mice mount specific humoral immune responses immunization viral antigens supports animal model promising tool preclinical evaluation human vaccine antigens,CRISPR Gene Editing
"The genetic modification of rats is a key technology for advancing biomedical research on human diseases. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing enables the generation of knockout rats in a single step, without the need for embryonic stem cells, by directly injecting genome editing components into zygotes. This simplifies the process, reduces costs, and accelerates gene function analysis in rats. However, the insertion of a gene cassette into a target site has remained inefficient, limiting the generation of knockin (KI) rats. To overcome this issue, we developed an optimized method that covers the entire process from zygote harvesting with superovulation to timed microinjection, ensuring the consistent generation of KI rats. We successfully generated four different fluorescent reporter lines at the ROSA26 locus in rats.

"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disorder with diverse clinical manifestations and unpredictable progression, posing significant challenges to accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Traditional biomarkers and treatments often fail to address the disease's molecular and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advancements in CRISPR gene-editing technology and multiomics approaches offer transformative opportunities for personalized SLE care by unraveling its underlying molecular complexity and enabling precise therapeutic interventions. CRISPR technology allows targeted editing of SLE-associated genetic mutations, addressing disease drivers directly, while multiomics-including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics-provides insights into dysregulated immune networks, identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Integrating these approaches can refine patient stratification and enhance the precision of treatments. Artificial intelligence (AI) complements these technologies by synthesizing high-dimensional data, enabling personalized treatment plans, predicting disease trajectories, and optimizing therapeutic strategies. However, the integration of CRISPR and multiomics in clinical settings raises challenges, including technical limitations, ethical concerns, and economic barriers. Emerging clinical trials and case studies demonstrate the potential of these innovations to personalize care and improve outcomes. Nonetheless, the transition from experimental research to routine clinical application requires robust regulatory frameworks and strategies to address these challenges.

"Chemoresistance and immunosuppression are common obstacles to the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) and are regulated by mitochondrial chaperone proteins. Here we show that the disruption of the tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) gene, which encodes a mitochondrial chaperone in tumour cells, causes the translocation of cyclophilin D in tumour cells. This process results in the continuous opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which enhances chemotherapy-induced cell necrosis and promotes immune responses. On the basis of this discovery we developed an oral CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system based on zwitterionic and polysaccharide polymer-coated nanocomplexes that disrupts the TRAP1 gene in CRC. This system penetrates the intestinal mucus layer and undergoes epithelial transcytosis, accumulating in CRC tissues. It enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by overcoming chemoresistance and activating the tumour immune microenvironment in orthotopic, chemoresistant and spontaneous CRC models, with remarkable synergistic antitumour effects.

"Pancreatic cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths, especially pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and it's characterized by a poor prognosis. The KRAS gene mutation is prevalent in about 85% of pancreatic cancer cases, which is a significant factor in the pathogenesis and development of pancreatic cancer, impacting cellular tumor growth, survival, and metastasis. The targeted disruption of mutant KRAS variants through the application of various CRISPR systems has led to a marked reduction in cell viability and proliferation in vitro, accompanied by significant inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. This systematic study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and PLOS One for original research articles published up to June 2024. Studies included those involving CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing targeting KRAS mutations in human or animal models of pancreatic cancer. Data collection and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. The review identified numerous studies demonstrating the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 in targeting KRAS mutations. Results showed significant reductions in KRAS transcript levels, decreased tumor progression, and improved survival rates in experimental models. However, challenges such as off-target effects and efficient delivery methods were noted.

"The development of ideal plant architecture is crucial for optimizing grain yield in crop breeding. The transition from prostrate growth habit in wild rice to erect growth habit in cultivated rice is one of the important events during rice domestication. Here, we identified a yield-related quantitative trait locus (QTL) cluster on the short arm of chromosome 7 using Teqing/W2014 (Oryza nivara) derived BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub> population. The introgression line TIL81 containing this QTL cluster exhibited significantly larger tiller angle, increased tiller numbers, and prostrate growth habit compared to the recipient parent Teqing. Using a segregating F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between TIL81 and Teqing, this yield-related QTL cluster was mapped to a similar position as the known rice plant architecture domestication (RPAD) locus controlling rice plant architecture domestication. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome (where CRISPR is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) editing of four zinc finger transcription factors (OnZnF1, OnZnF6, OnZnF8, and OnZnF9) within the RPAD locus demonstrated their collective involvement in regulating plant architecture and yield-related traits. Notably, the knockout lines harboring all four zinc finger gene mutations exhibited plant architecture traits and grain yield per plant comparable to the control Teqing.

"Gene therapy is an innovative medical approach that offers new treatment options for congenital and acquired diseases by transferring, correcting, inactivating or regulating genes to supplement, replace or modify a gene function. The approval of voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), a gene therapy for RPE65-associated retinopathy, has marked a milestone for the field of retinal gene therapy, but has also helped to accelerate the development of gene therapies for genetic diseases affecting other organs. Voretigene neparvovec is a vector based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) that delivers a functional copy of RPE65 to supplement the missing function of this gene. The AAV-based gene delivery has proven to be versatile and safe for the transfer of genetic material to retinal cells. However, challenges remain in treating additional inherited as well as acquired retinopathies with this technology. Despite the high level of activity in this field, no other AAV gene therapy for retinal diseases has been approved since voretigene neparvovec. Ongoing research focuses on overcoming the current restraints through innovative strategies like AAV capsid engineering, dual-AAV vector systems, or CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing.

"Proteinase 3 (PR3) is a major autoantigen in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Here, we performed a proof-of-principle study using ex vivo CRISPR-Cas9 guided gene editing to eliminate the PR3 autoantigen as an alternative to suppressing the autoimmune response to PR3. A ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of Cas9 protein and a PR3-specific single guide-RNA was transfected into human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) by electroporation. Effects on PR3 protein abundance, neutrophil differentiation, and ANCA-dependent and -independent neutrophil responses were assessed. Gene editing introduced a frame shift in exon 2 of PRTN3. Consequently, PR3 protein was efficiently reduced in neutrophil-differentiated HSPCs as demonstrated by immunoblotting, ELISA, microscopy, and the complete absence of PR3-specific proteolytic activity. Human neutrophil elastase served as control and was not affected. PR3-deleted (PR3<sup>KO</sup>)- and PR3 wild-type (PR3<sup>WT</sup>)-HSPCs showed similar neutrophil differentiation. Importantly, general neutrophil defense functions to non-ANCA receptor-independent and -dependent stimuli were similar in PR3<sup>KO</sup>- and PR3<sup>WT</sup>-neutrophils as was constitutive apoptosis.

"The cGAS-STING pathway is crucial for immune tolerance, pathogen resistance, and tumor immunity. Knocking out the cGAS gene can reverse the type I interferonopathy seen in Trex1<sup>-/-</sup> and Trex1<sup>D18N/D18N</sup> mice. TREX1, a key DNA-specific exonuclease in mammalian cells, degrades cytoplasmic DNA to prevent excessive immune activation. Mutations in TREX1 are linked to various autoimmune diseases. In prior research, we generated a Trex1-P212fs mouse model associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. This model displays systemic inflammation that mirrors numerous characteristics of both Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and SLE in humans. In this study, we found that the TREX1-P212fs mutation resulted in reduced dsDNA enzyme activity. DNA accumulation was present in the cytoplasm of Trex1<sup>P212fs/P212fs</sup> MEFs. Nonetheless, the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in mediating the disease phenotype in Trex1-P212fs mice associated with SLE has yet to be elucidated. We observed that cGas knockout mitigated systemic inflammation, lymphocyte proliferation, vasculitis, renal disease, and spontaneous T cell activation in Trex1-P212fs mice. Similarly, inhibition of STING with C-176 treatment ameliorated the disease phenotype in Trex1-P212fs mice.

"Hereditary spastic paraplegia type 47 (SPG47) is caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in the AP4B1 gene, leading to neurodevelopmental and progressive motor impairment. This study aimed to generate and characterize a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model of SPG47 to investigate the role of ap4b1 in neurodevelopment and motor function. We employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to generate a stable ap4b1-/- zebrafish line. Behavioral, morphological, and motor function analyses were performed, including survival under stress conditions, spontaneous locomotor activity, light-dark transition assays, and coiling behavior. Axonal length was assessed via immunofluorescence targeting spinal motor neurons. Seizure susceptibility was evaluated using a PTZ paradigm. ap4b1-/- zebrafish exhibited significantly reduced axonal length of spinal motor neurons, impaired motor function, and developmental malformations, including brachycephaly, reduced body length, bent spines, and craniofacial defects. Increased tail coiling and reduced spontaneous activity were observed in larvae, alongside absent habituation to light-dark stimuli. Under stress conditions, survival rates were significantly lower in the knockout group compared to controls. Despite early hyperexcitability, no significant increase in PTZ-induced seizures was observed. This study characterizes an ap4b1-/- zebrafish model that recapitulates some phenotypes of SPG47, including motor deficits and morphological abnormalities. These findings support the utility of zebrafish for studying AP-4 deficiency and provide a platform for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying SPG47.",CRISPR Gene Editing,hereditary spastic paraplegia type spg caused biallelic lossoffunction variants apb gene leading neurodevelopmental progressive motor impairment study aimed generate characterize zebrafish danio rerio model spg investigate role apb neurodevelopment motor function employed crisprcas geneediting generate stable apb zebrafish line behavioral morphological motor function analyses performed including survival stress conditions spontaneous locomotor activity lightdark transition assays coiling behavior axonal length assessed via immunofluorescence targeting spinal motor neurons seizure susceptibility evaluated using ptz paradigm apb zebrafish exhibited significantly reduced axonal length spinal motor neurons impaired motor function developmental malformations including brachycephaly reduced body length bent spines craniofacial defects increased tail coiling reduced spontaneous activity observed larvae alongside absent habituation lightdark stimuli stress conditions survival rates significantly lower knockout group compared controls despite early hyperexcitability significant increase ptzinduced seizures observed study characterizes apb zebrafish model recapitulates phenotypes spg including motor deficits morphological abnormalities findings support utility zebrafish studying ap deficiency provide platform investigating molecular mechanisms underlying spg,CRISPR Gene Editing
"CRISPR/Cas9, as a well-established gene editing technology, has been applied in numerous model organisms, but its application in wild-type <i>E. coli</i> remains limited. Pathogenic wild-type <i>E. coli</i>, a major cause of foodborne illnesses and intestinal inflammation in humans and animals, poses a significant global public health threat. The valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) is a key virulence factor that enhances <i>E. coli</i> pathogenicity. In this study, PCR was used to identify 50 strains carrying the virulence gene <i>VgrG2</i> out of 83 wild pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> strains, with only one strain sensitive to kanamycin and spectinomycin. A homologous repair template for <i>VgrG2</i> was constructed using overlap PCR. A dual-plasmid CRISPR/Cas9 system, combining pTarget (spectinomycin resistance) and pCas (kanamycin resistance) with Red homologous recombination, was then used to induce genomic cleavage and knock out <i>VgrG2</i>. PCR and sequencing confirmed the deletion of a 1708 bp fragment of the <i>VgrG2</i> gene in wild-type <i>E. coli</i>. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with <i>E. coli</i>-WT and <i>E. coli</i> ∆<i>VgrG2</i>, and treated with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to study the effects of <i>VgrG2</i> on the mTOR signaling pathway. The qPCR results showed that <i>VgrG2</i> activated the mTOR pathway, suppressed <i>mTOR</i> and <i>p62</i> mRNA levels, and upregulated the autophagy-related genes and LC3-II protein expression. In conclusion, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to achieve large-fragment deletions in wild-type <i>E. coli</i>, revealing that <i>VgrG2</i> activates the mTOR signaling pathway and upregulates autophagy markers.

"In insects, the number of life cycles varies inter- and intra-specifically, and it is widely accepted that the variation in the number of life cycles is an adaptive response to diverse environmental conditions. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies the variety and plasticity in the number of life cycles is largely unknown. In the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, the <i>Voltinism</i> (<i>V</i>) locus has three alleles, <i>V</i><sup>1</sup>(univoltine; dominant), <i>V</i><sup>2</sup> (bivoltine; standard), and <i>V</i><sup>3</sup> (polyvoltine; recessive), which are known to generate variation in the number of life cycles in a year under natural conditions, with obligatory diapause for the <i>V</i><sup>1</sup> allele, facultative diapause for <i>V</i><sup>2</sup>, and non-diapause for <i>V</i><sup>3</sup>. Here, we further confirm that the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuron signal pathway modulates progeny diapause via controlling diapause hormone release. A population genetic analysis (<i>F</i>st) revealed that the <i>synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A</i> and <i>2B</i> (<i>BmSV2A</i> and <i>BmSV2B</i>) genes, tightly related to the transport of neurotransmitters, are located in the <i>V</i> locus. Importantly, using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing technique, we have discovered that the <i>BmSV2A</i> and <i>BmSV2B</i> genes increased or modified the expression of GABAergic neuron signal pathway genes, respectively.

"Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (<i>PNPLA3</i>) p.I148M is a well-established variant associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Conflicting <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data about the impact of the variant suggest that the <i>PNPLA3</i> p.I148M variant could be gain- or loss-of-function, or neomorphic. Most <i>in vitro</i> models used to study MASLD are cancer-derived hepatoma cell lines such as HepG2 and Huh7 which already endogenously express the homozygous <i>PNPLA3</i> p.I148M variant. This highlights the need to develop models that better reflect disease and allow comparisons with wild-type cells. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) prime editing was used to introduce the <i>PNPLA3</i> p.I148M gene variant into a healthy-derived immortalised human hepatocyte (IHH) cell line to generate a new <i>in vitro</i> model of MASLD that would better reflect PNPLA3-associated MASLD/MASH.

Changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis or transport suggest the involvement of <i>PNPLA3</i> p.I148M in the dysregulation of these pathways and processes. The homozygous <i>PNPLA3</i> p.I148M IHH cell line also demonstrated reduced <i>PNPLA3</i> gene and protein expression compared to the wild-type control.

"Plants face an array of environmental stresses, including both abiotic and biotic stresses. These stresses significantly impact plant lifespan and reduce agricultural crop productivity. Abiotic stresses, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, high and low temperatures, salinity, drought, floods, heavy metal toxicity, etc., contribute to widespread crop losses globally. On the other hand, biotic stresses, such as those caused by insects, fungi, and weeds, further exacerbate these challenges. These stressors can hinder plant systems at various levels, including molecular, cellular, and development processes. To overcome these challenges, multi-omics computational approaches offer a significant tool for characterizing the plant's biomolecular pool, which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and signaling response to environmental changes. Integrating multiple layers of omics data, such as proteomics, metabolomics, ionomics, interactomics, and phenomics, simplifies the study of plant resistance mechanisms. This comprehensive approach enables the development of regulatory networks and pathway maps, identifying potential targets for improving resistance through genetic engineering or breeding strategies. This review highlights the valuable insights from integrating multi-omics approaches to unravel plant stress responses to both biotic and abiotic factors. By decoding gene regulation and transcriptional networks, these techniques reveal critical mechanisms underlying stress tolerance. Furthermore, the role of secondary metabolites in bio-based products in enhancing plant stress mitigation is discussed. Genome editing tools offer promising strategies for improving plant resilience, as evidenced by successful case studies combating various stressors. On the whole, this review extensively discusses an advanced multi-omics approach that aids in understanding the molecular basis of resistance and developing novel strategies to improve crops' or organisms' resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses.",CRISPR Gene Editing,plants face array environmental stresses including abiotic biotic stresses stresses significantly impact plant lifespan reduce agricultural crop productivity abiotic stresses ultraviolet uv radiation high low temperatures salinity drought floods heavy metal toxicity etc contribute widespread crop losses globally hand biotic stresses caused insects fungi weeds exacerbate challenges stressors hinder plant systems various levels including molecular cellular development processes overcome challenges multiomics computational approaches offer significant tool characterizing plants biomolecular pool crucial maintaining homeostasis signaling response environmental changes integrating multiple layers omics data proteomics metabolomics ionomics interactomics phenomics simplifies study plant resistance mechanisms comprehensive approach enables development regulatory networks pathway maps identifying potential targets improving resistance genetic engineering breeding strategies review highlights valuable insights integrating multiomics approaches unravel plant stress responses biotic abiotic factors decoding gene regulation transcriptional networks techniques reveal critical mechanisms underlying stress tolerance furthermore role secondary metabolites biobased products enhancing plant stress mitigation discussed genome editing tools offer promising strategies improving plant resilience evidenced successful case studies combating various stressors whole review extensively discusses advanced multiomics approach aids understanding molecular basis resistance developing novel strategies improve crops organisms resilience abiotic biotic stresses,CRISPR Gene Editing

"Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a common monogenic disorder characterized by high plasma cholesterol levels leading to chronic cardiovascular disease with high risk and often early manifestation due to atherosclerotic lesions of the blood vessels. The atherosclerotic lesions in familial hypercholesterolaemia are mainly caused by pathogenic variants of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene, which plays an important role in cholesterol metabolism. Normally, cholesterol-laden low-density lipoproteins bind to the LDLR receptor on the surface of liver cells to be removed from the bloodstream by internalisation with hepatocytes. In familial hypercholesterolaemia, the function of the receptor is impaired and the uptake of low-density lipoproteins is significantly reduced. As a result, cholesterol accumulates in the subendothelial space on the inner wall of blood vessels, triggering atherogenesis, the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. At present, there are no effective and universal approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia. A relevant approach to study the molecular genetic mechanisms of the disease and to obtain systems for screening chemical compounds as potential drugs is the generation of cellular models based on patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. The aim of our work was to derive an isogenic genetically modified induced pluripotent stem cell line by correcting the pathogenic allelic variant c.530C of the LDLR gene in the original iPSC previously obtained from a compound heterozygote patient with familial hypercholesterolaemia. The resulting isogenic iPSC line differs from the original by only one corrected nucleotide substitution, allowing us to study the direct effect of this pathogenic genetic variant on physiological changes in relevant differentiated cells. CRISPR/Cas-mediated base editing was used to correct the single nucleotide substitution. The resulting genetically modified iPSC line has pluripotency traits, a normal karyotype, a set of short tandem repeats identical to that in the original line and can be used to obtain differentiated derivatives necessary for the elaboration of relevant cell models.",CRISPR Gene Editing,familial hypercholesterolaemia common monogenic disorder characterized high plasma cholesterol levels leading chronic cardiovascular disease high risk often early manifestation due atherosclerotic lesions blood vessels atherosclerotic lesions familial hypercholesterolaemia mainly caused pathogenic variants lowdensity lipoprotein receptor ldlr gene plays important role cholesterol metabolism normally cholesterolladen lowdensity lipoproteins bind ldlr receptor surface liver cells removed bloodstream internalisation hepatocytes familial hypercholesterolaemia function receptor impaired uptake lowdensity lipoproteins significantly reduced result cholesterol accumulates subendothelial space inner wall blood vessels triggering atherogenesis formation atherosclerotic plaques present effective universal approaches diagnosis treatment familial hypercholesterolaemia relevant approach study molecular genetic mechanisms disease obtain systems screening chemical compounds potential drugs generation cellular models based patientspecific induced pluripotent stem cells aim work derive isogenic genetically modified induced pluripotent stem cell line correcting pathogenic allelic variant cc ldlr gene original ipsc previously obtained compound heterozygote patient familial hypercholesterolaemia resulting isogenic ipsc line differs original one corrected nucleotide substitution allowing us study direct effect pathogenic genetic variant physiological changes relevant differentiated cells crisprcasmediated base editing used correct single nucleotide substitution resulting genetically modified ipsc line pluripotency traits normal karyotype set short tandem repeats identical original line used obtain differentiated derivatives necessary elaboration relevant cell models,CRISPR Gene Editing
"The response rate of antibody therapy targeting immune checkpoint molecules in ovarian cancer is insufficient. This study aimed to develop a novel gene immunotherapy model targeting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in vivo in ovarian cancer using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 and investigate its efficacy. In vitro, we produced PD-L1-AAV particles to knock out PD-L1. PD-L1-AAV particles were transduced into the murine ovarian cancer cell line ID8. PD-L1 expression at the cellular level was significantly decreased following treatment with PD-L1-AAV particles compared with control-AAV particles. In the peritoneal dissemination model, the survival time was significantly longer in the PD-L1-AAV particles intraperitoneally injected group than that in the control group. Furthermore, intratumoral lymphocyte recruitment was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and the number of intratumoral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was significantly higher, whereas that of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells was significantly lower in the PD-L1-AAV particles injected group than in the control group.

"Hemophilia, a congenital bleeding disorder, can cause arthropathy, impaired mobility, pain, and life-threatening hemorrhage events, significantly impacting quality of life for patients and caregivers. Current therapies, although effective, necessitate costly lifelong treatment, often in specialized settings. However, as a monogenic disorder caused by loss-of-function genetic variants, hemophilia is amenable to gene therapy. In this article, three primary gene therapy approaches at the forefront of clinical development are reviewed. Adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, having secured approval in the EU, UK, and USA after promising Phase 3 trial results, demonstrates clear superiority over standard-of-care treatment. Lentivirus-based approaches capable of transducing dividing and nondividing cells may improve the durability of treatment and have low susceptibility to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to viral vectors. Finally, gene editing techniques such as zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR aim to correct genetic defects directly, holding promise as novel, effective, and highly durable therapeutic strategies in adults and children with hemophilia. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current status of these gene therapy approaches, highlighting advantages, limitations, and potential future developments.",CRISPR Gene Editing,hemophilia congenital bleeding disorder cause arthropathy impaired mobility pain lifethreatening hemorrhage events significantly impacting quality life patients caregivers current therapies although effective necessitate costly lifelong treatment often specialized settings however monogenic disorder caused lossoffunction genetic variants hemophilia amenable gene therapy article three primary gene therapy approaches forefront clinical development reviewed adenoassociated virusbased gene therapy secured approval eu uk usa promising phase trial results demonstrates clear superiority standardofcare treatment lentivirusbased approaches capable transducing dividing nondividing cells may improve durability treatment low susceptibility preexisting neutralizing antibodies viral vectors finally gene editing techniques zinc finger nucleases crispr aim correct genetic defects directly holding promise novel effective highly durable therapeutic strategies adults children hemophilia review provides comprehensive summary current status gene therapy approaches highlighting advantages limitations potential future developments,CRISPR Gene Editing
"TP53, the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, encodes a transcriptional activator that induces myriad downstream target genes. Despite the importance of p53 in tumor suppression, the specific p53 target genes important for tumor suppression remain unclear. Recent studies have identified the p53-inducible gene Zmat3 as a critical effector of tumor suppression, but many questions remain regarding its p53-dependence, activity across contexts, and mechanism of tumor suppression alone and in cooperation with other p53-inducible genes. To address these questions, we used Tuba-seq<sup>Ultra</sup> somatic genome editing and tumor barcoding in a mouse lung adenocarcinoma model, combinatorial in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screens, meta-analyses of gene expression and Cancer Dependency Map data, and integrative RNA-sequencing and shotgun proteomic analyses. We established Zmat3 as a core component of p53-mediated tumor suppression and identified Cdkn1a as the most potent cooperating p53-induced gene in tumor suppression. We discovered that ZMAT3/CDKN1A serve as near-universal effectors of p53-mediated tumor suppression that regulate cell division, migration, and extracellular matrix organization. Accordingly, combined Zmat3-Cdkn1a inactivation dramatically enhanced cell proliferation and migration compared to controls, akin to p53 inactivation. Together, our findings place ZMAT3 and CDKN1A as hubs of a p53-induced gene program that opposes tumorigenesis across various cellular and genetic contexts.",CRISPR Gene Editing,tp frequently mutated gene human cancer encodes transcriptional activator induces myriad downstream target genes despite importance p tumor suppression specific p target genes important tumor suppression remain unclear recent studies identified pinducible gene zmat critical effector tumor suppression many questions remain regarding pdependence activity across contexts mechanism tumor suppression alone cooperation pinducible genes address questions used tubaseqsupultrasup somatic genome editing tumor barcoding mouse lung adenocarcinoma model combinatorial vivo crisprcas screens metaanalyses gene expression cancer dependency map data integrative rnasequencing shotgun proteomic analyses established zmat core component pmediated tumor suppression identified cdkna potent cooperating pinduced gene tumor suppression discovered zmatcdkna serve nearuniversal effectors pmediated tumor suppression regulate cell division migration extracellular matrix organization accordingly combined zmatcdkna inactivation dramatically enhanced cell proliferation migration compared controls akin p inactivation together findings place zmat cdkna hubs pinduced gene program opposes tumorigenesis across various cellular genetic contexts,CRISPR Gene Editing
"A key application of CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic editing is modification of genes to introduce engineered sequences. However, the editing flexibility is severely constrained by the requirement for targeting sites in proximity to the desired modification site, which makes many modifications intractable. Here, we develop a strategy that overcomes this key limitation to allow CRISPR-based editing at any position with high efficiency. It relies on reconstructing the targeted gene using Silently Mutate And Repair Template (SMART) where we mutate the gap sequence in the repair template to prevent its base pairing with the target DNA while maintaining the same amino acid coding. Using vertebrate retina as a neuronal model system we document the application of SMART editing for labeling endogenous proteins in vivo with high efficiency. We show that SMART editing allows us to access numerous cell types in the retina and address fundamental cell biological questions pertaining to its organization.

"CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering by allowing precise introductions of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, genome engineering in bacteria is still a complex, multi-step process requiring a donor DNA template for repair of DSBs. Prime editing circumvents this need as the repair template is indirectly provided within the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE is RecA-independent and can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner.

"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has arisen as a promising method due to its spatiotemporal precision and minimal invasiveness. It encounters significant obstacles in solid tumors due to hypoxia-induced therapeutic resistance and the self-protective mechanisms of cancer cells facilitated by MutT homolog 1 (MTH1), an enzyme involved in oxidative damage repair. Herein, we fabricate a tumor-microenvironment responsive CRISPR nanoplatform based on hollow mesoporous manganese dioxide (H-MnO<sub>2</sub>) for PDT. This platform utilizes H-MnO<sub>2</sub> to produce oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in TME, thereby mitigating hypoxia and enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The high concentration of glutathione (GSH) and hyaluronidase (HAase) in TME induces the release of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNP) to target the MTH1 gene, thereby impairs oxidative damage repair pathways and amplifys ROS-mediated cytotoxicity. The released Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions function as immunomodulatory agents, activate innate immune responses via stimulating STING signal pathway. In vitro, IHMRH NPs markedly increased intracellular O<sub>2</sub> levels, ROS production, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, leading to tumor cell death, immune activation, and effective gene editing. In vivo, the nanoplatform suppressed tumor growth, diminished MTH1 gene expression, stimulated dendritic cell (DC) maturation through immunogenic cell death (ICD).

"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease (Cas) technologies facilitate routine genome engineering of one or a few genes at a time. However, large-scale CRISPR screens with guide RNA libraries remain challenging in plants. Here, we have developed a comprehensive all-in-one CRISPR toolbox for Cas9-based genome editing, cytosine base editing, adenine base editing (ABE), Cas12a-based genome editing and ABE, and CRISPR-Act3.0-based gene activation in both monocot and dicot plants. We evaluated all-in-one T-DNA expression vectors in rice (Oryza sativa, monocot) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, dicot) protoplasts, demonstrating their broad and reliable applicability. To showcase the applications of these vectors in CRISPR screens, we constructed guide RNA (gRNA) pools for testing in rice protoplasts, establishing a high-throughput approach to select high-activity gRNAs. Additionally, we demonstrated the efficacy of sgRNA library screening for targeted mutagenesis of ACETOLACTATE SYNTHASE in rice, recovering novel candidate alleles for herbicide resistance. Furthermore, we carried out a CRISPR activation screen in Arabidopsis thaliana, rapidly identifying potent gRNAs for FLOWERING LOCUS T activation that confer an early-flowering phenotype.

"Lactobacilli play essential roles in the food industry and have a significant potential as probiotics and therapeutic agents. Genomic and genetic information has increasingly accumulated and been linked to their various functions, to which transgenic approaches are being performed to verify crucial genes. In order to reasonably develop more useful strains, beneficial traits need to be introduced into any given strains and enhanced or combined based on such genotype characterization. However, for practical use as probiotics or foods, organisms with transgene are hardly acceptable. Here, we have introduced the base editing Target-AID system specifically for Lactobacilli, enabling precise installation of point mutations without donor DNA and at multiple genomic loci simultaneously. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum has been successfully engineered to reduce production of imidazole propionate, which has been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes by impairing glucose tolerance and insulin signaling. Additionally, this system enabled transient knock-out of an essential gene, such as one involved in cell division, resulting in severe filamentous cell phenotype. This demonstrates Target-AID is a promising genetic tool for Lactobacilli and can accelerate both applied and fundamental research.

"With the widespread application of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing and related fields, along with the increasing availability of metagenomic data, the demand for detecting and classifying CRISPR-Cas systems in metagenomic data sets has grown significantly. Traditional classification methods for CRISPR-Cas systems primarily rely on identifying cas genes near CRISPR arrays. However, in cases where cas gene information is absent, such as in metagenomes or fragmented genome assemblies, traditional methods may fail. Here, we present a deep learning-based method, CRISPRclassify-CNN-Att, which classifies CRISPR loci solely based on repeat sequences. CRISPRclassify-CNN-Att utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms to extract features from repeat sequences. It employs a stacking strategy to address the imbalance of samples across different subtypes and uses transfer learning to improve classification accuracy for subtypes with fewer samples. CRISPRclassify-CNN-Att demonstrates outstanding performance in classifying multiple subtypes, particularly those with larger sample sizes. Although CRISPR loci classification traditionally depends on cas genes, CRISPRclassify-CNN-Att offers a novel approach that serves as a significant complement to cas-based methods, enabling the classification of orphan or distant CRISPR loci.

"Recent advances in functional genomics tools have ushered in a new era of genetic editing to identify molecular pathways relevant to developmental and disease biology. However, limited model systems are available that adequately mimic cell states and phenotypes associated with human disease pathways. Here, we quantitatively analyzed the founder population bottleneck effect and demonstrated how the population changes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to hematopoietic stem cells and to the final induced macrophage population. We then engineered a key gene encoding an enzyme in the myeloid cell antiviral pathway-<i>SAMHD1-</i>knockout (KO) hiPSCs and characterized the hiPSC line with RNA-Seq and induced macrophages from two distinct protocols with functional analysis. We then generated <i>SAMHD1</i> KO CRISPR-dCAS9 KRAB hiPSCs through lentiviral transduction aiming to increase the efficiency of lentiviral mediated gene transfer. We demonstrated increased lentiviral transduction efficiency in induced macrophages, as well as microglia induced with two distinct protocols. This model allows for efficient gene knockdown, as well as large-scale functional genomics screens in mature hiPSC-derived macrophages or microglia with applications in innate immunity and chronic inflammatory disease biology.

"Radiotherapy is critical component of multidisciplinary cancer care, used as a primary and adjuvant treatment for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This study investigates how mannose, a naturally occurring monosaccharide, combined with phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) depletion, enhances the sensitivity of HPV-negative head and neck tumour models to radiation. Isogenic PMI knockout models were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, yielding a 20-fold increase in sensitivity to mannose in vitro, and causing significant tumour growth delay in vivo. This effect is driven by metabolic reprogramming, resulting in potent glycolytic suppression coupled with consistent depletion of ATP and glycolytic intermediates in PMI-depleted models. Functionally, these changes impede DNA damage repair following radiation, resulting in a significant increase in radiation sensitivity. Mannose and PMI ablation supressed both oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification, pushing cells towards a state of metabolic quiescence, effects contributing to increased radiation sensitivity under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In 3D-tumoursphere models, metabolic suppression by mannose and PMI depletion was shown to elevate intra-tumoursphere oxygen levels, contributing to significant in vitro oxygen-mediated radiosensitisation. These findings position PMI as a promising anti-tumour target, highlighting the potential of mannose as a metabolic radiosensitiser enhancing cancer treatment efficacy.",CRISPR Gene Editing,radiotherapy critical component multidisciplinary cancer care used primary adjuvant treatment patients head neck squamous cell carcinoma study investigates mannose naturally occurring monosaccharide combined phosphomannose isomerase pmi depletion enhances sensitivity hpvnegative head neck tumour models radiation isogenic pmi knockout models generated crisprcas gene editing yielding fold increase sensitivity mannose vitro causing significant tumour growth delay vivo effect driven metabolic reprogramming resulting potent glycolytic suppression coupled consistent depletion atp glycolytic intermediates pmidepleted models functionally changes impede dna damage repair following radiation resulting significant increase radiation sensitivity mannose pmi ablation supressed oxygen consumption rate extracellular acidification pushing cells towards state metabolic quiescence effects contributing increased radiation sensitivity normoxic hypoxic conditions dtumoursphere models metabolic suppression mannose pmi depletion shown elevate intratumoursphere oxygen levels contributing significant vitro oxygenmediated radiosensitisation findings position pmi promising antitumour target highlighting potential mannose metabolic radiosensitiser enhancing cancer treatment efficacy,CRISPR Gene Editing

"Genome modification is essential for studying and engineering bacteria, yet making efficient modifications to most species remains challenging. Bacteriophage-encoded single-stranded DNA-annealing proteins (SSAPs) can facilitate efficient genome editing by homologous recombination, but their typically narrow host range limits broad application. Here, we demonstrate that a single library of 227 SSAPs enables efficient genome-editing across six diverse bacteria from three divergent classes: Actinomycetia (<i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> and <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>), Alphaproteobacteria (<i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> and <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>), and Bacilli (<i>Lactococcus lactis</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>). Surprisingly, the most effective SSAPs frequently originated from phyla distinct from their bacterial hosts, challenging the assumption that phylogenetic relatedness is necessary for recombination efficiency, and supporting the value of a large unbiased library. Across these hosts, the identified SSAPs enable genome modifications requiring efficient homologous recombination, demonstrated through three examples. First, we use SSAPs with Cas9 in <i>C. crescentus</i> to introduce single amino acid mutations with >70% efficiency. Second, we adapt SSAPs for dsDNA editing in <i>C. glutamicum</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>, enabling one-step gene knockouts using PCR products. Finally, we apply SSAPs for multiplexed editing in <i>S. aureus</i> to precisely map the interaction between a conserved protein and a small-molecule inhibitor.

"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease primarily diagnosed in childhood, characterized by pancreatic β-cell destruction, severe insulin deficiency, and hyperglycemia. Current treatments, including insulin therapy and glucose-lowering medications, manage the condition but fall short of offering a cure. In this review we explore the potential of stem-cell therapy as a transformative and curative approach for T1D, focusing on its promise in regenerating β-cells and addressing challenges specific to the pediatric population. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to evaluate stem-cell types: embryonic, perinatal, adult, induced pluripotent and cancer stem cells, and their role in T1D treatment. Particular emphasis was placed on methods for β-cell differentiation, advancements in autologous and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and emerging strategies to overcome safety, efficacy, and economic barriers. Challenges such as immune rejection, tumorigenicity, and cost-effectiveness were analyzed, alongside novel solutions like immune-shielding and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) technology. Stem-cell therapy presents a promising avenue for curing T1D, offering potential for β-cell regeneration and reduced dependence on exogenous insulin. However, challenges such as delayed β-cell functionality, immune responses, tumor risks, and high costs hinder widespread application. Advancements in personalized medicine, immune-shielding strategies, and cost reduction may pave the way for clinical success, especially in pediatric populations.

"This review discusses new treatment approaches for familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare disorder affecting triglyceride metabolism. The focus is on antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and small-interfering RNA (siRNA) therapies targeting APOC3 and angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). Volanesorsen, an ASO targeting APOC3, has shown effectiveness in managing FCS, multifactorial chylomicronemia, and familial partial lipodystrophy, but its use is limited by thrombocytopenia. Emerging therapies, Olezarsen (ASO anti-APOC3) and Plozasiran (siRNA anti-APOC3), both conjugated with GalNAc, show promise in reducing acute pancreatitis risk without platelet concerns. ANGPTL3 inhibition requires residual lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, with only siRNA-based therapies-zodasiran and solbinsiran-under investigation.

"<i>Bupleurum chinense</i> DC. a medicinal plant valued for saikosaponins (SSs) with antipyretic and hepatoprotective properties, faces constrained SS biosynthesis mediated by abscisic acid (ABA) during growth. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) are hypothesized to participate in ABA signaling cascades, but their mechanistic role in SS regulation remains undefined. In this study, 20 differentially expressed <i>BcbHLH</i> genes were identified by transcriptomic profiling of ABA-induced hairy roots, with four MYC-family candidates (<i>BcbHLH1-BcbHLH4</i>) demonstrating ABA-responsive regulatory potential. ABA exposure (100 or 200 μmol/L, 24-72 h) induced dose-dependent SS reduction, while correlation analyses revealed coordinated expression between <i>BcbHLH1-BcHMGR</i> (<i>r</i> = 0.62) and <i>BcbHLH4-BcBAS</i> (<i>r</i> = 0.78), pinpointing these TFs as critical nodes in SS pathway modulation. Tissue-specific profiling showed predominant <i>BcbHLH</i> expression in stems and young leaves, with nuclear localization confirming their transcriptional regulatory organelles. BcbHLH3/4 exhibited transcriptional activation activity in the MYC_N domain, while molecular docking predicted 11th Arginine in the HLH domain as essential for G-box DNA binding. Collectively, our findings suggest that BcbHLH1-BcbHLH4 may serve as potential switches for fine-tuning ABA responsiveness in SS biosynthesis. Strategic manipulation of <i>BcbHLH</i> activity through genetic engineering approaches such as CRISPR-based editing or overexpression could alleviate ABA-mediated biosynthetic repression. Furthermore, precision engineering of the critical functional domain in BcbHLH could enhance promoter-binding activity to target genes and improve SS biosynthesis efficiency.

"Effective temporal and spatial regulation of CRISPR-Cas9 catalytic activity remains a key challenge, limiting the clinical application of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing. Here, we investigated the long-range allosteric inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SauCas9) catalytic activity by its anti-CRISPR (Acr) protein, AcrIIA14, aiming to uncover remote allosteric mechanisms in large protein complexes and identify potential allosteric sites for the design of SauCas9 inhibitors. Through a combined computational-experimental framework integrating extensive molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, network community modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified canonical and non-canonical inhibitory states of SauCas9 regulated by AcrIIA14. Key domains, including REC, L1, HNH, L2, and PI, play crucial roles in transmitting the AcrIIA14-meidated inhibitory signal. Introducing point mutations on the routes of allosteric communication and analyzing these mutants using in vitro DNA cleavage assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that SauCas9 escaped AcrIIA14's inhibition owing to the disruption of AcrIIA14-meidated allosteric communication. Moreover, two cryptic allosteric sites on SauCas9 were identified as mutations of these sites prevented inhibition of SauCas9 by AcrIIA14.

"FD, a conserved bZIP transcription factor, is well known for its role in promoting flowering. Here, we uncover that a short coding sequence of the Chrysanthemum morifolium FD gene, CmFDa, represses flowering. Interestingly, we identified CmFDa as a novel epiallele stringently regulated by DNA methylation in chrysanthemum for the first time. Epigenetic editing of the CmFDa promoter using the CRISPR-dCas9-TET1cd for demethylation or dCas9-SunTag-NtDRM2cd for methylation can, respectively, repress or promote flowering. CmFDa epigenetically represses the floral transition by suppressing the expression of the floral activators CmSOC1 and CmAP1. We show that CmFDa recruits the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the CmSOC1 and CmAP1 promoters. These results reveal that CmFDa is an inhibitor of flowering by epigenetic repression of flowering integrator genes.

"Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) is a powerful approach for mining genetic data to engineer industrial microorganisms. This evolution-informed design requires robust genetic tools to incorporate the discovered alleles into target strains. Here, we introduce the EasyGuide CRISPR, a five-plasmid platform that exploits E. coli's natural recombination system to assemble gRNA plasmids from overlapping PCR fragments. The production of gRNAs and donor DNA is further facilitated by using recombination cassettes generated through PCR with 40-60-mer oligos. With the new CRISPR toolkit, we constructed 22 gene edits in E. coli DH5α, most of which corresponded to alleles mapped in E. coli DH5α and E2348/69 ALE populations selected for sucrose propagation. For DH5α ALE, sucrose consumption was supported by the cscBKA operon expression from a high-copy plasmid. During ALE, plasmid integration into the chromosome, or its copy number reduction due to the pcnB deletion, conferred a 30-35 % fitness gain, as demonstrated by CRISPR-engineered strains. A ∼5 % advantage was also associated with a ∼40.4 kb deletion involving fli operons for flagella assembly. In E2348/69 ALE, inactivation of the hfl system suggested selection pressures for maintaining λ-prophage dormancy (lysogeny).

"Sickle cell disease (SCD and β-thalassemia (BT) affects millions of people worldwide. In addition, around 500,000 infants are born with SCD and 60,000 people are diagnosed with BT every year. Mutations in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene are responsible for causing both BT and SCD. Indeed, the diversity of potential mutations in the HBB gene elucidates the diversity in clinical severity observed in individuals with BT and related morbidities. On the other hand, SCD takes place because of the alteration in a single amino acid at position 6 in the beta-globin chain, where a base substitution occurs from glutamic acid to valine, which eventually results in abnormal sickle hemoglobin. Conventional therapies for BT and SCD including pharmaceutical drugs and blood transfusion might temporarily improve the clinical severity of these diseases, however these therapies cannot cure the diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 (CC9) is revolutionizing genome engineering, offering promising therapeutic avenues for genetic diseases. Therefore, CC9-mediated gene therapy provides great hope in the treatment of both BT and SCD. CC9-mediated gene therapy has already demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting both SCD and BT-causing mutations. Moreover, CC9-mediated gene editing was found to be effective in reactivating the expression of hemoglobin F (HbF) and regulating LRF and BCL11A. A number of clinical trials with CC9 gene-edited therapies are being carried out to elucidate their potential in treating BT and SCD. Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of SCD and BT, the mechanism of CC9-mediated gene editing, and common delivery methods of the CC9 system have been discussed in this review. Moreover, an in-depth discussion on applications and the current status of CC9-mediated gene editing in SCD and BT along with current challenges and future perspectives have been provided.",CRISPR Gene Editing,sickle cell disease scd thalassemia bt affects millions people worldwide addition around infants born scd people diagnosed bt every year mutations hemoglobin subunit beta hbb gene responsible causing bt scd indeed diversity potential mutations hbb gene elucidates diversity clinical severity observed individuals bt related morbidities hand scd takes place alteration single amino acid position betaglobin chain base substitution occurs glutamic acid valine eventually results abnormal sickle hemoglobin conventional therapies bt scd including pharmaceutical drugs blood transfusion might temporarily improve clinical severity diseases however therapies cannot cure diseases crisprcas cc revolutionizing genome engineering offering promising therapeutic avenues genetic diseases therefore ccmediated gene therapy provides great hope treatment bt scd ccmediated gene therapy already demonstrated effectiveness correcting scd btcausing mutations moreover ccmediated gene editing found effective reactivating expression hemoglobin f hbf regulating lrf bcla number clinical trials cc geneedited therapies carried elucidate potential treating bt scd genetics pathophysiological mechanisms scd bt mechanism ccmediated gene editing common delivery methods cc system discussed review moreover indepth discussion applications current status ccmediated gene editing scd bt along current challenges future perspectives provided,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a significant source of morbidity and mortality in developing nations. Despite this, E. histolytica is understudied, leading to few treatment options and a poor understanding of pathogenesis. Genetic tools have historically been limited. By applying modern approaches, it was recently revealed that the genome is aneuploid. Interestingly, gene expression levels do not correlate with ploidy, potentially highlighting the importance of RNAi in gene regulation. Characterization of the RNAi pathway has led to potent tools for targeted gene knockdown, and the advent of RNAi-based forward genetics.

"Base editors are engineered deaminases combined with CRISPR components. These engineered deaminases are designed to target specific sites within DNA or RNA to make a precise change in the molecule. In therapeutics, they hold promise for correcting mutations associated with genetic diseases. However, a key challenge is minimizing unintended edits at off-target sites, which could lead to harmful mutations. Researchers are actively addressing this concern through a variety of optimization efforts that aim to improve the precision of base editors and minimize off-target activity. Here, we examine the various types of off-target activity, and the methods used to evaluate them. Current methods for finding off-target activity focus on identifying similar sequences in the genome or in the transcriptome, assuming the guide RNA misdirects the editor. The main method presented here, that was originally developed to quantify editing levels mediated by the ADAR enzyme, takes a different approach, investigating the inherent activity of base editors themselves, which might lead to off-target edits beyond sequence similarity. The editing index tool quantifies global off-target editing, eliminates the need to detect individual off-target sites, and allows for assessment of the global load of mutations.",CRISPR Gene Editing,base editors engineered deaminases combined crispr components engineered deaminases designed target specific sites within dna rna make precise change molecule therapeutics hold promise correcting mutations associated genetic diseases however key challenge minimizing unintended edits offtarget sites could lead harmful mutations researchers actively addressing concern variety optimization efforts aim improve precision base editors minimize offtarget activity examine various types offtarget activity methods used evaluate current methods finding offtarget activity focus identifying similar sequences genome transcriptome assuming guide rna misdirects editor main method presented originally developed quantify editing levels mediated adar enzyme takes different approach investigating inherent activity base editors might lead offtarget edits beyond sequence similarity editing index tool quantifies global offtarget editing eliminates need detect individual offtarget sites allows assessment global load mutations,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Cancer continues to be a significant worldwide health concern, characterized by high rates of occurrence and death. Unfortunately, existing treatments frequently fall short of delivering satisfying therapeutic outcomes. Immunotherapy has ushered in a new era in the treatment of solid tumors, yet its effectiveness is still constrained and comes with unwanted side effects. The advancement of cutting-edge technology, propelled by gene analysis and manipulation at the molecular scale, shows potential for enhancing these therapies. The advent of genome editing technologies, including CRISPR-Cas9, can greatly augment the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing and its wide range of tools.

"Deafness is a common genetic disorder, where mutations,in the OTOF gene can disrupt the normal functionof the Otoferlin protein, leading to impaired neurotransmitter release in the inner ear and subsequent deafness. Despite the complexity of the pathogenic mechanism,it is not fully understood. Zebrafish are an excellent model for studying genetically-induced deafness ,but there have been no previous reports on the pathogenesis of OTOF in zebrafish .This study successfully established a zebrafish model with mutated OTOF genes using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to investigate the molecular basis of OTOF-induced deafness. Compared to AB wild type zebrafish, those with low otof expression showed injury and apoptosis of hair cells in the posterior lateral neuromasts along with significant increase in the number of macrophages and apoptotic cells in this region. Additionally, these mutants exhibited a reduction in body length. To further elucidate differences at 5dpf (days post-fertilization) between mutant and wild type zebrafish embryos , RNA-seq analysis was conducted to examine differentially expressed genes (DEGs).A total of 334 up-regulated DEGs and 111 down-regulated DEGs were identified in mutants compared to wild types.KEGG and GO enrichment analyses were performed on these DEGs to identify key signaling pathways and hub DEGs. The findings revealedan increased expression of several genes involved in the HSP70 oxidative stress system,suggesting that OTOF may protect cochlear hair cell from apoptosis induced by oxidative stress through regulation of MAPK signal and HSP70 expression.In summary, the establishment of a zebrafish model with OTOF knockout provides a valuable tool for investigating the function of Otoferlin and understanding the role of the OTOF gene in deafness.

"Gout, a type of inflammatory arthritis, arises from the accumulation of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to severe pain and inflammation. While conventional treatments, such as uric acid-lowering agents and anti-inflammatory drugs, are effective, they are often associated with adverse effects. This review aims to explore the potential of phytoconstituents as alternative therapeutic agents for gout, focusing on their mechanisms of action and strategies to enhance their clinical efficacy. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze the role of phytochemicals in gout management. Key compounds such as quercetin, curcumin, and resveratrol were examined for their effects on inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and uric acid regulation. Furthermore, advancements in drug delivery systems, including nanotechnology-based formulations and CRISPR-mediated pathway modulation, were explored to address the limitations of phytoconstituents. Phytoconstituents demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and xanthine oxidase inhibitory properties. These compounds modulated critical pathways such as NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, and MAPK, reducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and uric acid levels. However, poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism remain key challenges, necessitating advanced formulation strategies to enhance their therapeutic potential. Phytoconstituents offer a promising alternative for gout treatment by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms. Integrating nanotechnology and gene-editing approaches may improve their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Further research is warranted to facilitate clinical translation and optimize their application in gout management.",CRISPR Gene Editing,gout type inflammatory arthritis arises accumulation monosodium urate crystals joints leading severe pain inflammation conventional treatments uric acidlowering agents antiinflammatory drugs effective often associated adverse effects review aims explore potential phytoconstituents alternative therapeutic agents gout focusing mechanisms action strategies enhance clinical efficacy comprehensive literature review conducted analyze role phytochemicals gout management key compounds quercetin curcumin resveratrol examined effects inflammatory pathways oxidative stress uric acid regulation furthermore advancements drug delivery systems including nanotechnologybased formulations crisprmediated pathway modulation explored address limitations phytoconstituents phytoconstituents demonstrated significant antiinflammatory antioxidant xanthine oxidase inhibitory properties compounds modulated critical pathways nfb nlrp inflammasome mapk reducing inflammation oxidative stress uric acid levels however poor bioavailability rapid metabolism remain key challenges necessitating advanced formulation strategies enhance therapeutic potential phytoconstituents offer promising alternative gout treatment targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms integrating nanotechnology geneediting approaches may improve bioavailability therapeutic efficacy research warranted facilitate clinical translation optimize application gout management,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Efficient gene cluster editing tools are one of the key techniques for discovering novel compounds encoded by silent natural product (NP) biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in microbial genomes. Currently, <i>in vivo</i> BGC editing tools developed in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> is the most widely used, but they often introduces DNA scars into gene clusters, which may affect the function of target NP BGCs.

"Aspergillus niger, a filamentous fungus, is known as a cell factory due to its ability to produce large amounts of organic acids and industrial enzymes. Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) is one of the most widely used lipases in industrial applications, including oil processing, papermaking, food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique was employed to knock out the pyrG and kusA genes in A. niger. The CALB gene was integrated into the high-production protein gene loci, such as glaA and amyA, to construct a multi-copy CALB production engineered strain. Additionally, the pepA, aglU, and bglA genes were deleted, which minimized the background level of secreted proteins in A. niger and increased the production of CALB. After two rounds of gene editing, the A. niger with multi-copy CALB was created, and the engineered A. niger CCTCC 206047.09 with high CALB yield was isolated. After 120 h of liquid fermentation, the lipase activity reached 17.84 U/mL and the protein yield reached 10.21 mg/mL. In summary, an engineered A. niger strain with high lipase activity was successfully isolated by employing a CRISPR/Cas9 system to integrate CALB into high-expression loci, while simultaneously knocking out the host's highly expressed protein genes.

"Pooled CRISPR screens are vital in the unbiased interrogation of gene function and are instrumental in uncovering therapeutic targets and biological processes. However, follow-up hit validation is critical to confirm observed results. Researchers need a simple and robust approach to rapidly verify putative hits and test resulting observations. Thus, we developed a CRISPR-based method for hit validation that tests the effect of a genetic perturbation on cell fitness. By editing target loci and monitoring the indel profiles over time, we have created a Cellular Fitness (CelFi) assay that can elucidate cellular vulnerabilities and verify hits from pooled CRISPR knockout screens. Unlike traditional cellular fitness assays that evaluate viability over time, the CelFi assay correlates changes in the indel profile at the target gene with a selective growth advantage or disadvantage in individual cells over time. Moreover, the CelFi assay can be utilized to evaluate gene dependencies and test new hypotheses, regardless of variations in single guide RNA optimization, ribonucleoprotein concentration, and gene copy number.",CRISPR Gene Editing,pooled crispr screens vital unbiased interrogation gene function instrumental uncovering therapeutic targets biological processes however followup hit validation critical confirm observed results researchers need simple robust approach rapidly verify putative hits test resulting observations thus developed crisprbased method hit validation tests effect genetic perturbation cell fitness editing target loci monitoring indel profiles time created cellular fitness celfi assay elucidate cellular vulnerabilities verify hits pooled crispr knockout screens unlike traditional cellular fitness assays evaluate viability time celfi assay correlates changes indel profile target gene selective growth advantage disadvantage individual cells time moreover celfi assay utilized evaluate gene dependencies test new hypotheses regardless variations single guide rna optimization ribonucleoprotein concentration gene copy number,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Regulatory DNA provides a platform for transcription factor binding to encode cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression. However, the effects and programmability of regulatory DNA sequences remain difficult to map or predict. Here, we develop variant effects from flow-sorting experiments with CRISPR targeting screens (Variant-EFFECTS) to introduce hundreds of designed edits to endogenous regulatory DNA and quantify their effects on gene expression. We systematically dissect and reprogram 3 regulatory elements for 2 genes in 2 cell types. These data reveal endogenous binding sites with effects specific to genomic context, transcription factor motifs with cell-type-specific activities, and limitations of computational models for predicting the effect sizes of variants. We identify small edits that can tune gene expression over a large dynamic range, suggesting new possibilities for prime-editing-based therapeutics targeting regulatory DNA.

"Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) have been used extensively to control some major crop pests, but their benefits decrease when pests evolve resistance. Better understanding of the genetic basis of resistance is needed to effectively monitor, manage, and counter pest resistance to Bt crops. Resistance to Bt proteins in at least 11 species of Lepidoptera, including many important crop pests, is associated with naturally occurring mutations that disrupt one or more of three larval midgut proteins: cadherin and ATP-binding cassette proteins ABCC2 and ABCC3. Here, we determined how CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations disrupting cadherin, ABCC2, and ABCC3 singly and in pairs affect resistance to Bt proteins Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa in the Asian corn borer (<i>Ostrinia furnacalis</i>), which is the most damaging pest of corn in Asia and is closely related to the European corn borer (<i>Ostrinia nubilalis</i>), a major pest in Europe and North America. The results from bioassays of six knockout strains and their parent susceptible strain support a model in which Cry1Ab can kill larvae via one path requiring ABCC2 or another path requiring cadherin and ABCC3, whereas Cry1Fa uses only the first path. The model's predictions are generally supported by results from genetic linkage analyses and responses to Cry1Ab and Cry1Fa of Sf9 cells and <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes modified to produce cadherin, ABCC2, and ABCC3 singly or in pairs. The functional redundancy identified here for Cry1Ab could sustain its efficacy against <i>O. furnacalis</i> and may exemplify a widespread natural strategy for delaying resistance.",CRISPR Gene Editing,crops genetically engineered produce insecticidal proteins bacterium ibacillus thuringiensisi bt used extensively control major crop pests benefits decrease pests evolve resistance better understanding genetic basis resistance needed effectively monitor manage counter pest resistance bt crops resistance bt proteins least species lepidoptera including many important crop pests associated naturally occurring mutations disrupt one three larval midgut proteins cadherin atpbinding cassette proteins abcc abcc determined crisprcasmediated mutations disrupting cadherin abcc abcc singly pairs affect resistance bt proteins cryab cryfa asian corn borer iostrinia furnacalisi damaging pest corn asia closely related european corn borer iostrinia nubilalisi major pest europe north america results bioassays six knockout strains parent susceptible strain support model cryab kill larvae via one path requiring abcc another path requiring cadherin abcc whereas cryfa uses first path models predictions generally supported results genetic linkage analyses responses cryab cryfa sf cells ixenopusi oocytes modified produce cadherin abcc abcc singly pairs functional redundancy identified cryab could sustain efficacy io furnacalisi may exemplify widespread natural strategy delaying resistance,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Genome-editing technology has advanced significantly since the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for the development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). While CRISPR-Cas9 has become widely used in academic research, its social implementation has lagged due to unresolved patent disputes and slower progress in gene function analysis. To address this, new approaches bypassing direct gene function analysis are needed, with bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing (NGS) playing crucial roles. NGS is essential for sequencing the genome of target species, but challenges such as data quality, genome heterogeneity, ploidy, and small individual sizes persist. Despite these issues, advancements in sequencing technologies, like PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), have improved genome sequencing.

"The CRISPR/Cas system is a sizable family that is currently a popular and efficient gene editing tool. Cas12i3, as a member of the Type V-I family, has the characteristics of recognizing T-rich PAM sequences and being guided by shorter crRNA and has higher gene editing efficiency than Cas9 in rice. However, as a potential tool in accelerating the breeding process, the application of Cas12i3 in mammalian embryos has not yet been reported. Our study systematically evaluated the feasibility of applying CRISPR/Cas12i3 to gene editing in mouse embryos, with the core pluripotency regulator gene <i>Nanog</i> as the target. We successfully constructed a <i>Nanog</i> loss-of-function mouse embryo model using CRISPR/Cas12i3. At the targeted <i>Nanog</i> locus, its editing efficiency exceeded that of the Cas9 system under matched experimental conditions; no off-target phenomenon was detected. Moreover, the Cas12i3 system exhibited no side effect on mouse embryo development and proliferation of blastocyst cells. Finally, we obtained healthy chimeric gene-edited offspring by optimizing the concentration of the Cas12i3 mixture.

"Fibrotic diseases, contributing to a significant portion of global mortality, highlight the need for innovative therapies. This study explores a novel approach to disrupt the expression of collagen by using adenine base editing to target Col1a1, a key gene driving both fibrosis and cancer metastasis. Editing Col1a1 in fibroblasts demonstrated 18% editing efficiency. An analysis of a specific clone harboring a CCAAT-to-CCGGA mutation in the Col1a1 promoter revealed reduced collagen production. Notably, when wild-type fibroblasts were cultured on the Col1a1-edited matrix, no compensatory collagen upregulation was detected, suggesting a lack of feedback mechanism in fibroblasts. Furthermore, the matrix derived from edited fibroblasts did not support the growth of MCF-7 cancer cells. These findings suggest that Col1a1 gene editing holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for fibrotic diseases.

"RyR1-related myopathies (RyR1-RMs) include a wide range of genetic disorders that result from mutations in the <i>RYR1</i> gene. Pathogenic variants lead to defective intracellular calcium homeostasis and muscle dysfunction. Fixing intracellular calcium leaks by stabilizing the RyR1 calcium channel has been identified as a promising therapeutic target. Gene therapy via prime editing also holds great promise as it can cure diseases by correcting genetic mutations. However, as more than 700 variants have been identified in the <i>RYR1</i> gene, a universal treatment would be a more suitable solution for patients. Our investigation into the RyR1-S2843A mutation has yielded promising results. Using a calcium leak assay, we determined that the S2843A mutation was protective when combined with pathogenic mutations and significantly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak of the RyR1 channel. Our study demonstrated that prime editing can efficiently introduce the protective S2843A mutation. In vitro experiments using the RNA electroporation of the prime editing components in human myoblasts achieved a 31% introduction of this mutation.

"Rare monogenic disorders are caused by mutations in single genes and have an incidence rate of less than 0.5%. Due to their low prevalence, these diseases often attract limited research and commercial interest, leading to significant unmet medical needs. In a therapeutic landscape where treatments are targeted to manage symptoms, gene editing therapy emerges as a promising approach to craft curative and lasting treatments for these patients, often referred to as ""one-and-done"" therapeutics. CRISPR-dependent base editing enables the precise correction of genetic mutations by direct modification of DNA bases without creating potentially deleterious DNA double-strand breaks. Base editors combine a nickase version of Cas9 with cytosine or adenine deaminases to convert C·G to T·A and A·T to G·C, respectively. Together, cytosine (CBE) and adenine (ABE) base editors can theoretically correct ∼95% of pathogenic transition mutations cataloged in ClinVar. This mini-review explores the application of base editing as a therapeutic approach for rare monogenic disorders. It provides an overview of the state of gene therapies and a comprehensive compilation of preclinical studies using base editing to treat rare monogenic disorders. Key considerations for designing base editing-driven therapeutics are summarized in a user-friendly guide for researchers interested in applying this technology to a specific rare monogenic disorder.

"The CRISPR system has emerged as a ground-breaking gene-editing tool, offering promising therapeutic potential for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 5000 male births globally. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes a critical membrane-associated protein essential for maintaining muscle structure, function and repair. Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle degeneration, loss of ambulation, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac failure, with most succumbing to the disease by their third decade of life. Despite the well-characterized genetic basis of DMD, curative treatments- such as exon skipping therapies, micro-dystrophin, and steroids- remain elusive. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the promise of CRISPR-based approaches in restoring dystrophin expression across various models, including human cells, murine systems, and large animal models. These advancements highlight the potential of gene editing to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the disease. However, significant challenges persist, including immunogenicity, off-target effects, and limited editing efficiency, which hinder clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest developments in CRISPR-based therapeutic strategies for DMD.

"CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-based gene editing via homologous recombination (HR) enables precise gene correction and insertion. However, its low efficiency poses a challenge due to the predominance of nonhomologous end-joining during DNA repair processes. Although numerous efforts have been made to boost HR efficiency, there remains a critical need to devise a novel method that can be universally applied across cell types and in vivo animals, which could ultimately facilitate therapeutic treatments. This study demonstrated that autophagy induction using different protocols, including nutrient deprivation or chemical treatment, significantly improved HR-associated gene editing at diverse genomic loci in mammalian cells. Notably, interacting cofactor proteins that bind to Cas9 under the autophagic condition have been identified, and autophagy induction could also enhance in vivo HR-associated gene editing in mice.

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis with unknown etiology, characterized by synovial inflammation and articular bone erosion. Studies have highlighted that inhibiting macrophage-induced osteoclastogenesis holds promise in mitigating bone destruction. However, specifically halting this pathological cascade remains a challenge for the management of RA. Here, initially, we identify that Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) is a pivotal target in inducing osteoclastogenesis of macrophages. Subsequently, we develop a strategy termed specific macrophages RhoA targeting (SMART), in which phosphatidylserine (PS)-enriched macrophage membranes are engineered to deliver macrophage-specific promoter-containing CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids (SMART-Cas9), enabling targeted editing of RhoA in RA joint macrophages. Multiscale imaging techniques confirm the highly specific targeted effect of SMART-Cas9 on the macrophages of inflamed joints. SMART-Cas9 successfully reduces osteoclastogenesis by macrophages, thus mitigating bone erosion by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and immune balance in inflammatory arthritis, representing a therapeutic avenue for RA and other inflammatory bone diseases.",CRISPR Gene Editing,rheumatoid arthritis ra prevalent inflammatory arthritis unknown etiology characterized synovial inflammation articular bone erosion studies highlighted inhibiting macrophageinduced osteoclastogenesis holds promise mitigating bone destruction however specifically halting pathological cascade remains challenge management ra initially identify ras homolog gene family member rhoa pivotal target inducing osteoclastogenesis macrophages subsequently develop strategy termed specific macrophages rhoa targeting smart phosphatidylserine psenriched macrophage membranes engineered deliver macrophagespecific promotercontaining crisprcas plasmids smartcas enabling targeted editing rhoa ra joint macrophages multiscale imaging techniques confirm highly specific targeted effect smartcas macrophages inflamed joints smartcas successfully reduces osteoclastogenesis macrophages thus mitigating bone erosion modulating cytoskeletal dynamics immune balance inflammatory arthritis representing therapeutic avenue ra inflammatory bone diseases,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Medulloblastomas (MBs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in children, marked by aggressive growth, molecular heterogeneity, and a high propensity for cerebrospinal dissemination. Despite advancements in conventional treatments - surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy-substantial challenges persist, including debilitating long-term toxicities and emerging resistance to therapy. This review examines the multifaceted roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) - particularly long non-- coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) - in pediatric medulloblastoma pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic targeting. NcRNAs exert robust regulatory effects on gene expression by modulating signaling pathways, acting as miRNA sponges, and controlling the expression of oncogenic or tumor-suppressive genes. In this study, we focus on notable examples of lncRNAs (e.g., HOTAIR, TP73-AS1) and circRNAs (e.g., circ-SKA3, circ_63706) implicated in fundamental oncogenic processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and stem cell maintenance. We also discuss their subgroup-specific roles, emphasizing high-risk groups, such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Group 3 medulloblastomas. In parallel, we explore the potential of ncRNAs to serve as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers, given their tissue-specific expression, stability, and detectability in biological fluids like the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). Finally, we review emerging therapeutic strategies, including antisense oligonucleotides, RNA sponges, and CRISPR-based editing, aimed at disrupting oncogenic ncRNA functions or reinforcing tumor-suppressive pathways. While these strategies hold promise, major hurdles include functional redundancy, optimizing in vivo delivery, and mitigating off-target effects. By detailing these challenges and outlining future research directions, this review underscores the revolutionary potential of ncRNA-focused diagnostics and therapies for managing pediatric medulloblastomas, offering new paths for improving survival outcomes and quality of life in affected children.",CRISPR Gene Editing,medulloblastomas mbs common malignant brain tumors children marked aggressive growth molecular heterogeneity high propensity cerebrospinal dissemination despite advancements conventional treatments surgery chemotherapy radiation therapysubstantial challenges persist including debilitating longterm toxicities emerging resistance therapy review examines multifaceted roles noncoding rnas ncrnas particularly long non coding rnas lncrnas circular rnas circrnas pediatric medulloblastoma pathogenesis diagnosis therapeutic targeting ncrnas exert robust regulatory effects gene expression modulating signaling pathways acting mirna sponges controlling expression oncogenic tumorsuppressive genes study focus notable examples lncrnas eg hotair tpas circrnas eg circska circ implicated fundamental oncogenic processes cell proliferation apoptosis metastasis stem cell maintenance also discuss subgroupspecific roles emphasizing highrisk groups sonic hedgehog shh group medulloblastomas parallel explore potential ncrnas serve diagnosticprognostic biomarkers given tissuespecific expression stability detectability biological fluids like cerebrospinal fluid csf finally review emerging therapeutic strategies including antisense oligonucleotides rna sponges crisprbased editing aimed disrupting oncogenic ncrna functions reinforcing tumorsuppressive pathways strategies hold promise major hurdles include functional redundancy optimizing vivo delivery mitigating offtarget effects detailing challenges outlining future research directions review underscores revolutionary potential ncrnafocused diagnostics therapies managing pediatric medulloblastomas offering new paths improving survival outcomes quality life affected children,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Atherosclerosis, a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, is characterized by plaque formation resulting from the accumulation of fibrous elements, lipids, and calcification in arteries, leading to complications such as ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. Traditional treatments primarily address symptoms but fail to target underlying causes, prompting exploration of novel approaches like gene therapy. The TGF-β family, encompassing TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, plays a critical role in cellular processes including proliferation, apoptosis, and migration, with its dysregulation strongly linked to cardiovascular diseases. In atherosclerosis, TGF-β influences key factors, such as macrophage cholesterol regulation, plaque stability, and vascular smooth muscle cell function, while also contributing to endothelial dysfunction- an early stage in disease development. Personalized medicine has highlighted the importance of tailoring therapies to genetic profiles, particularly regarding TGF-β pathway variations such as SNPs in TGF-β1 and TGFBR2, which could inform more precise interventions. Emerging technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA-based therapies enable targeted modulation of these genetic factors, offering new avenues to mitigate disease progression. CRISPR-Cas9 allows direct editing of gene loci linked to atherosclerosis, potentially correcting mutations or modulating expression levels, while RNA-based therapies, including siRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides, provide additional precision tools for addressing dysregulated genes. This review focuses on identifying key genes and additional molecular players involved in or regulated by the TGF-β pathway that may serve as precise targets for gene therapy intervention in atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases. By targeting genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial function, gene therapy offers a targeted strategy to ameliorate the genetic drivers of these conditions. In summary, modulation of TGF-β signaling by gene therapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases while shedding light on the underlying genetic mechanisms of these disorders.",CRISPR Gene Editing,atherosclerosis leading cause global morbidity mortality characterized plaque formation resulting accumulation fibrous elements lipids calcification arteries leading complications ischemic stroke coronary artery disease myocardial infarction traditional treatments primarily address symptoms fail target underlying causes prompting exploration novel approaches like gene therapy tgf family encompassing tgf tgf tgf plays critical role cellular processes including proliferation apoptosis migration dysregulation strongly linked cardiovascular diseases atherosclerosis tgf influences key factors macrophage cholesterol regulation plaque stability vascular smooth muscle cell function also contributing endothelial dysfunction early stage disease development personalized medicine highlighted importance tailoring therapies genetic profiles particularly regarding tgf pathway variations snps tgf tgfbr could inform precise interventions emerging technologies like crisprcas rnabased therapies enable targeted modulation genetic factors offering new avenues mitigate disease progression crisprcas allows direct editing gene loci linked atherosclerosis potentially correcting mutations modulating expression levels rnabased therapies including sirnas antisense oligonucleotides provide additional precision tools addressing dysregulated genes review focuses identifying key genes additional molecular players involved regulated tgf pathway may serve precise targets gene therapy intervention atherosclerosis related cardiovascular diseases targeting genes involved cholesterol metabolism inflammation endothelial function gene therapy offers targeted strategy ameliorate genetic drivers conditions summary modulation tgf signaling gene therapy potential revolutionize treatment atherosclerosis cardiovascular diseases shedding light underlying genetic mechanisms disorders,CRISPR Gene Editing

"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based targeted gene editing platforms are being developed to treat genetic diseases like hemophilia. Such novel therapy involves complex concepts and terminology that require aligned language to engage key stakeholders in the hemophilia community. Thus, a globally aligned gene editing lexicon - a consistent language to communicate the fundamentals of gene editing in hemophilia, designed to be credible and accessible for people with hemophilia and caregivers while avoiding unnecessary complexity - is required to address this need. To establish an aligned language and communications framework that facilitates informed consent and shared decision-making regarding gene editing and treatment considerations in hemophilia. Through an innovative partnership with global experts in hemophilia, gene editing, and biotechnology, initial insights were gathered via interviews, workshops, and analysis of existing language within the hemophilia community. Qualitative research involving lived experience experts (people with hemophilia and caregivers; <i>n</i> = 43) and hematologists (<i>n</i> = 24) informed the lexicon development, which was further validated by a steering committee of global experts in the hemophilia and gene editing fields. Finally, optimized language recommendations were developed for a clear, consistent gene editing lexicon. Key themes included insights into audience mindsets, guiding language principles, and optimized terminology for key topics like gene editing concepts and posttreatment considerations. Audience mindsets revealed cautious optimism around gene therapy, with more skepticism around gene editing. Guiding language principles indicated a preference for plainspoken over technical language, definitions that link to patient benefits, and explanations that highlight the precise nature of gene editing.

"Missplicing of transcripts is a frequent molecular mechanism in a wide range of inherited genetic conditions. Therapeutic splicing correction can be achieved through antisense oligonucleotides; however, they do not enable permanent correction. Concurrently, CRISPR-Cas9 approaches often rely on dual-guide RNA-induced larger deletions-for instance, pseudoexons removal-which raises concerns about higher genotoxicity from multiple double-strand breaks. We therefore investigated single-guide RNA CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to address the recurrent pathogenic <i>USH2A</i>:c.7595-2144A>G deep-intronic variant. Using single-guide RNAs with either Cas9 or Cas9 fused to TREX2 (EDCas9), we restored correct splicing in a minigene assay and patient-derived fibroblasts. Cas9 with single-guide RNAs generated small indels, but their frequency and extent varied between models, resulting in variable productivity with respect to splicing rescue efficacy. In contrast, EDCas9 produced larger, directional deletions with a consistent profile across both models, effectively disrupting missplicing-inducing sequences and ensuring robust splicing correction. Off-target assessments revealed a safe profile for both Cas9 and EDCas9, with EDCas9 additionally preventing targeted translocations. Virus-like particles delivered EDCas9 and a lead gRNA, demonstrating suitability as a transient delivery system. In conclusion, EDCas9 emerges as a flexible and powerful editing approach for addressing the pathogenic <i>USH2A</i>:c.7595-2144A>G variant, paving the way for further therapeutic investigation.",CRISPR Gene Editing,missplicing transcripts frequent molecular mechanism wide range inherited genetic conditions therapeutic splicing correction achieved antisense oligonucleotides however enable permanent correction concurrently crisprcas approaches often rely dualguide rnainduced larger deletionsfor instance pseudoexons removalwhich raises concerns higher genotoxicity multiple doublestrand breaks therefore investigated singleguide rna crisprcas approaches address recurrent pathogenic iushaicag deepintronic variant using singleguide rnas either cas cas fused trex edcas restored correct splicing minigene assay patientderived fibroblasts cas singleguide rnas generated small indels frequency extent varied models resulting variable productivity respect splicing rescue efficacy contrast edcas produced larger directional deletions consistent profile across models effectively disrupting missplicinginducing sequences ensuring robust splicing correction offtarget assessments revealed safe profile cas edcas edcas additionally preventing targeted translocations viruslike particles delivered edcas lead grna demonstrating suitability transient delivery system conclusion edcas emerges flexible powerful editing approach addressing pathogenic iushaicag variant paving way therapeutic investigation,CRISPR Gene Editing

"ATAD3A, a nuclear gene encoding the ATAD3A protein, has diverse roles in mitochondrial processes, encompassing mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial DNA maintenance, metabolic pathways and inter-organellar interactions. Pathogenic variants in this gene cause neurological diseases in humans with recognizable genotype-phenotype correlations. Yet, gaps in knowledge remain regarding the underlying pathogenesis. To further investigate the gene function and its implication in health and disease, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate a knockout model of the zebrafish ortholog gene, atad3. We characterized the phenotype of the null model, performed mitochondrial and functional tests, and compared the transcriptome of null embryos to their healthy siblings. Analysis of atad3-null zebrafish embryos revealed microcephaly, small eyes, pericardial edema and musculature thinning, closely mirroring the human rare disease phenotype. Larvae exhibited delayed hatching and embryonic lethality by 13 days post-fertilization (dpf). Locomotor activity, ATP content, mitochondrial content, and mitochondrial activity were all reduced in the mutant embryos. Transcriptome analysis at 3 dpf via RNA-sequencing indicated decline in most mitochondrial pathways, accompanied by a global upregulation of cytosolic tRNA synthetases, presumably secondary to mitochondrial stress and possibly endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress. Differential expression of select genes was corroborated in fibroblasts from an affected individual. The atad3-null zebrafish model emerges as a reliable representation of human ATAD3A-associated disorders, with similarities in differentially expressed pathways and processes. Furthermore, our study underscores mitochondrial dysfunction as the primary underlying pathogenic mechanism in ATAD3A-associated disorders and identifies potential readouts for therapeutic studies.",CRISPR Gene Editing,atada nuclear gene encoding atada protein diverse roles mitochondrial processes encompassing mitochondrial dynamics mitochondrial dna maintenance metabolic pathways interorganellar interactions pathogenic variants gene cause neurological diseases humans recognizable genotypephenotype correlations yet gaps knowledge remain regarding underlying pathogenesis investigate gene function implication health disease utilized crisprcas genome editing generate knockout model zebrafish ortholog gene atad characterized phenotype null model performed mitochondrial functional tests compared transcriptome null embryos healthy siblings analysis atadnull zebrafish embryos revealed microcephaly small eyes pericardial edema musculature thinning closely mirroring human rare disease phenotype larvae exhibited delayed hatching embryonic lethality days postfertilization dpf locomotor activity atp content mitochondrial content mitochondrial activity reduced mutant embryos transcriptome analysis dpf via rnasequencing indicated decline mitochondrial pathways accompanied global upregulation cytosolic trna synthetases presumably secondary mitochondrial stress possibly endoplasmic reticulum erstress differential expression select genes corroborated fibroblasts affected individual atadnull zebrafish model emerges reliable representation human atadaassociated disorders similarities differentially expressed pathways processes furthermore study underscores mitochondrial dysfunction primary underlying pathogenic mechanism atadaassociated disorders identifies potential readouts therapeutic studies,CRISPR Gene Editing
"Widespread delivery of therapeutic proteins to the brain remains challenging. To determine whether human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-microglia (iMG) could enable brain-wide and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutic cargo, we utilized CRISPR gene editing to engineer iMG to express the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin under control of the plaque-responsive promoter, CD9. To further determine whether increased engraftment enhances efficacy, we utilized a CSF1R-inhibitor resistance approach. Interestingly, both localized and brain-wide engraftment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice reduced multiple biochemical measures of pathology. However, within the plaque-dense subiculum, reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis and preservation of neuronal density were only achieved following widespread microglial engraftment.

This study aimed to develop a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype and evaluate its therapeutic potential in an XLRS mouse model. A novel RS1 mouse model was established using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system and underwent phenotypic characterization. AAV.IVT18-scRS/CMV-RS1, comprising a rationally designed novel capsid (AAV.IVT18) and an optimized RS1 gene expression cassette, was then constructed and delivered via intravitreal injection into mutant and wild-type (WT) mice at 3 to 4 weeks of age. Retinal structure, function, and inflammation levels were evaluated after treatment. A novel mouse model harboring the patient-derived RS1 missense variant R213W was generated, accurately recapitulating the human phenotype. We developed a novel AAV serotype, AAV.IVT18, which efficiently transfected photoreceptor and bipolar cells by intravitreal injection, and optimized the expression cassettes of RS1. AAV.IVT18-mediated expression of RS1 ameliorated retinoschisis in the mouse model and normalized the b/a ratio of the mouse electroretinogram (ERG). Remarkably, the ERG b-wave amplitudes of the treated groups began to increase at 8 weeks post-injection and recovered to the WT mouse level by 16 weeks of injection. Inflammatory activation in Rs1R213W mice was alleviated by treatment. The novel AAV capsid-mediated RS1 gene therapy effectively improved retinal structure and function while downregulating inflammation in Rs1R213W mice.

"Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a condition caused by interstitial infiltration of misfolded proteins structured into amyloid fibrils. Transthyretin (ATTR) and immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis represent the most common forms of CA. CA was traditionally perceived as a rare and incurable disease, but diagnostic and therapeutic advances have undermined the conventional paradigm. The standard of care for ATTR-CA include agents capable of selectively stabilizing the precursor protein (e.g., tafamidis), whereas the plasma cell clone is the main target of chemotherapy for AL-CA. For long, tafamidis represented the only drug approved for patients with ATTR-CA. Recent data from ATTRibute-CM led to the approval of acoramidis, whereas patisiran received refusal based on the APOLLO-B trial. Novel CRISPR-Cas9-based drugs (i.e., NTLA-2001) hold great potential in the setting of ATTR-CA. Several hematological regimens are available to treat AL-CA. The main limit of current therapies is their inability to trigger removal of amyloid from tissues. However, the investigation of monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded ATTR (e.g., PRX004, NI301A) or AL (e.g., birtamimab, anselamimab) has led to encouraging results. Various cutting-edge strategies are being tested for treatment of CA and may change the prognostic landscape of this condition in the next years.",CRISPR Gene Editing,cardiac amyloidosis ca condition caused interstitial infiltration misfolded proteins structured amyloid fibrils transthyretin attr immunoglobulin light chain al amyloidosis represent common forms ca ca traditionally perceived rare incurable disease diagnostic therapeutic advances undermined conventional paradigm standard care attrca include agents capable selectively stabilizing precursor protein eg tafamidis whereas plasma cell clone main target chemotherapy alca long tafamidis represented drug approved patients attrca recent data attributecm led approval acoramidis whereas patisiran received refusal based apollob trial novel crisprcasbased drugs ie ntla hold great potential setting attrca several hematological regimens available treat alca main limit current therapies inability trigger removal amyloid tissues however investigation monoclonal antibodies targeting misfolded attr eg prx nia al eg birtamimab anselamimab led encouraging results various cuttingedge strategies tested treatment ca may change prognostic landscape condition next years,CRISPR Gene Editing
"The treatment of extensive burns requires rapid allogeneic skin transplantation, but HLA diversity poses a significant challenge in finding histocompatible donor-recipient matches. In this study, we developed a humanized skin graft model using HLA class I transgenic mice to closely examine the HLA-mediated immune response in skin transplantation. Additionally, this model was used to analyse the response against a human lymphoblastoid cell line, JY, with HLA-B and -C genes knocked out by a single-step CRISPR-Cas9 strategy, retaining the most common HLA class I allele, HLA-A*02:01. Mice expressing the HLA-A02:01 allele alone or in combination with HLA-B07:02 do not reject the skin of animals expressing only HLA-A02:01. However, skin from HLA-A02:01/B07:02 mice transplanted into HLA-A02:01 mice is rejected, triggering a strong specific CD8 T cell response mediated by the HLA-B*07:02 molecule. In these latter mice, unlike the parental JY cell line, the edited cells did not induce a CD8 T cell response in vitro, suggesting that the selective deletion of HLA-B and -C may contribute to improve skin graft compatibility. This genetic engineering approach, repeated without modification for the five HLA-A class I most common alleles known to be associated with HLA-B7 and -C7 in the same haplotype, would cover 83.4% of the world population.

"An ideal microbial gene expression system for industrial enzyme production should possess a function complementary selection marker, a cost-effective inducer, and the ability for extracellular protein secretion. In this study，we employed CRISPR-Cpf1 gene editing technology to construct an engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum host strain, C. glutamicum Δalr∷araE ΔmurI, by deleting the alanine racemase-encoding gene alr and the glutamate racemase-encoding gene murI, and by integrating the Bacillus subtilis arabinose-related compounds permease-encoding gene araE into the chromosome. The two secretion-type expression vectors pAU30S (Sec-type) and pAU30T (Tat-type) that both employ alr as selection marker, the T7 transcription system to transcribe target genes, and the B. subtilis AraR-OR<sub>A1</sub>/OR<sub>A2</sub> negative control system to control gene transcription, were constructed.

"Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas)-based genome editing has significantly advanced genetic engineering due to its precision, simplicity, and versatility. However, achieving precise spatial and temporal control remains challenging, restricting therapeutic and research applications. Herein, we introduce a novel class of star-shaped, multivalent crRNAs engineered for precise spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12a editing systems. These crRNAs are synthesized via single-site chemical modification and can be efficiently purified. By integrating distinct photo-responsive chemical linkages, we achieved selective activation of crRNA activity upon irradiation with specific wavelengths, enabling orthogonal regulation of multiple genetic targets simultaneously. This method demonstrated robust OFF-ON switching capabilities in vitro, characterized by minimal leakage and rapid activation. Importantly, the approach also proved highly effective for temporally controlled gene editing in mammalian cells in vivo, achieving considerable editing efficiency following brief photoactivation. Due to its target sequence-independent, single-site modification design, this strategy may serve as a universal solution for diverse CRISPR/Cas systems, eliminating cumbersome optimization processes.

"Spermatogenesis, the process by which male germ cells develop into mature spermatozoa, is a complex and highly regulated phenomenon crucial for male fertility. Various molecular pathways, including ubiquitination, play critical roles in this process. Ubiquitination regulates multiple stages of spermatogenesis by controlling cell remodeling and protein metabolism. SplA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 3 (SPSB3), a SOCS box protein, interacts with ElonginC/B and recruits Cullin5 to form the ECS E3 ligase complex, which is involved in cell development, proliferation, stress response, and apoptosis. However, the specific role of SPSB3 in spermatogenesis and male reproduction remains poorly understood. The distribution and expression of <i>Spsb3</i> were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches. <i>Spsb3</i>-knockout (KO, <i>Spsb3<sup>-/-</sup></i> ) mice were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Sperm quality was assessed using a computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system. Histological and immunostaining analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of <i>Spsb3</i> deletion on mouse testicular structure. Apoptotic cells were detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Our findings indicate that <i>Spsb3</i> is a testis-enriched gene in mice. However, no significant differences were observed in sperm quality, fertility, or testis histology between <i>Spsb3</i> <sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) adult mice.

"Rice <i>hoja blanca</i> virus (RHBV), transmitted by the insect vector <i>Tagosodes orizicolus</i>, poses a significant threat to rice cultivation. Here, we use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to produce specific mutations in the <i>AGO4</i> gene of <i>Oryza sativa</i>, using the Fedearroz 2000 variety, with the aim of elucidating the participation of the gene in resistance to RHBV. We obtained 14 edited plants that presented with deletions of one, two, and three nucleotides in the sequence of exon 23 of the <i>AGO4</i> gene. Phenotypic evaluations showed an increase in susceptibility to RHBV in the edited lines. We identified the presence of RHBV in the leaf tissue of infected plants by amplifying the nucleoprotein, <i>NS3</i>, and <i>NS4</i> genes of the virus. Using RT-qPCR, we analyzed the expression patterns of the <i>AGO4</i> gene, showing that in the edited lines, the expression profiles are similar to the susceptible control. Furthermore, modeling of the tertiary structure of the AGO4 protein and its mutant variant demonstrated changes in the PIWI domain and the presence of the DDH catalytic triad, confirming its role in mediating resistance to RHBV.

"Breeding strains without basidiospores is important for the mushroom industry. However, target genes for sporeless breeding remain limited. To identify a new gene essential for basidiospore production in Pleurotus ostreatus, the RNA sequencing data obtained in our previous study were re-analyzed. Among the 36 P. ostreatus genes that are exclusively expressed in the gills where basidiospores are formed and produced, candidate genes were narrowed down using transcriptome data during the fruiting stage of Coprinopsis cinerea, in which the meiotic steps progress synchronously. Three C. cinerea genes homologous to the gill-specific P. ostreatus genes were upregulated during meiosis. One of these three genes encodes a protein homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mek1p, a protein kinase important in the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Plasmids containing expression cassettes for hygromycin B-resistance screening, Cas9, and single-guide RNA targeting mek1 were introduced into the protoplasts of the dikaryotic P. ostreatus strain PC9×#64, which showed that the obtained dikaryotic gene disruptant produced no basidiospores. Microscopic analysis suggests that meiosis is suspended during telophase I. These results suggested that P. ostreatus Mek1 is essential for meiosis II progression and basidiospore production.

"CRISPR-Cas9 is a useful tool for inserting precise genetic alterations through homology-directed repair (HDR), although current methods largely rely on provision of an exogenous repair template. Here, we tested the possibility of interchanging heterozygous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using mutation-specific guide RNA, and the cell's own wild-type allele rather than an exogenous template. Using high-fidelity Cas9 to perform allele-specific CRISPR across multiple human leukemia cell lines as well as in primary hematopoietic cells from patients with leukemia, we find high levels of reversion to wild-type in the absence of exogenous template. Moreover, we demonstrate that bulk treatment to revert a truncating mutation in ASXL1 using CRISPR-mediated interallelic gene conversion (IGC) is sufficient to prolong survival in a human cell line-derived xenograft model (median survival 33 days vs 27.5 days; p = 0.0040). These results indicate that IGC is a useful laboratory tool which can be applied to numerous types of leukemia and can meaningfully alter cellular phenotypes at scale. Because our method targets single-base mutations, rather than larger variants targeted by IGC in prior studies, it greatly expands the pool of genetic lesions which could potentially be targeted by IGC. This technique may reduce cost and complexity for experiments modeling phenotypic consequences of SNVs.

"Functional U6 promoters are widely utilized in CRISPR gene editing systems for crops. The identification of endogenous U6 promoter activity and the establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems in various crops can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of gene editing in molecular breeding. In this study, four U6 snRNAs were identified in the genome of the oil flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i> L.) cultivar Longya 10, which exhibit high homology with the promoter regions of Arabidopsis thaliana U6 snRNA. We cloned and constructed fusion expression vectors with U6 promoter-driven dual-luciferase reporter genes.

"Plants constantly encounter a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses that adversely affect their growth, development, and productivity. Phytohormones such as abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene serve as crucial regulators, integrating internal and external signals to mediate stress responses while also coordinating key developmental processes, including seed germination, root and shoot growth, flowering, and senescence. Transcription factors (TFs) such as WRKY, NAC, MYB, and AP2/ERF play complementary roles by orchestrating complex transcriptional reprogramming, modulating stress-responsive genes, and facilitating physiological adaptations. Recent advances have deepened our understanding of hormonal networks and transcription factor families, revealing their intricate crosstalk in shaping plant resilience and development.

Here, we established a method for protoplast isolation, purification, and CRISPR-Cas ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery in <i>Pinus taeda</i> and <i>Abies fraseri</i> as a step towards accelerating the genetic improvement of these coniferous tree species. In this system, purified protoplasts could be isolated from somatic embryos with up to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> protoplasts/g of tissue and transfected with proteins and nucleotides, achieving delivery efficiencies up to 13.5%. The delivery of functional RNPs targeting <i>phenylalanine ammonia lyase</i> in <i>P. taeda</i> and <i>phytoene desaturase</i> in <i>A. fraseri</i> yielded gene editing efficiencies that reached 2.1% and 0.3%, respectively. This demonstration of RNP delivery for DNA-free genome editing in the protoplasts of <i>P. taeda</i> and <i>A. fraseri</i> illustrates the potential of CRISPR-Cas to enhance the traits of value in ecologically and economically important tree species.

"<i>Fel d1</i> is the most important allergen secreted by cats, which can trigger asthma in sensitive individuals. Our objective was to knock-out the <i>Fel d1</i> gene in the fetal fibroblasts of cats through CRISPR-Cas9 technology with two sgRNAs and to determine the impact of such mutations on the antigenicity of the <i>Fel d1</i> protein. DNA samples from 38 domestic cats were collected and amplified by PCR to obtain the complete sequence of the <i>Fel d1</i> gene. Throughout evolution, <i>Fel d1</i> polypeptide chain 1(<i>CH1</i>) has proven to be much more conserved than <i>Fel d1</i> polypeptide chain 2(<i>CH2</i>); therefore, we targeted <i>CH2</i> and designed two single-guide RNAs (<i>CH2</i>-sgRNA-1 and <i>CH2</i>-sgRNA-2) for this region. Using these constructed sgRNAs, we performed gene knock-out in fetal fibroblasts, resulting in two mutations within the target gene. Following this, DNA was extracted and the target site product was cloned using TA cloning via PCR, and a single colony from this process was sequenced to analyze the physicochemical properties, antigenic sites, and three-dimensional structure of the mutated protein. The results revealed that there were 12 and 51 polymorphic loci (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) found in the <i>CH1</i> and <i>CH2</i> sequences, respectively, with most loci located in the GC-rich intron 2, while others were found in exon 2, intron 3, and exon 3. These SNPs guided sgRNA design by identifying conserved regions in the <i>CH2</i> gene. The gene editing efficiency for the <i>CH2</i> region, with this dual CRISPR system, was 40%, with 35% attributed to Type 1 mutation and 5% to Type 2 mutation. In conclusion, <i>CH1</i> is significantly more conserved than <i>CH2</i>, and the antigenicity of the <i>Fel d1 CH2</i> gene in domestic cats can be effectively reduced through CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.",CRISPR Gene Editing,ifel di important allergen secreted cats trigger asthma sensitive individuals objective knockout ifel di gene fetal fibroblasts cats crisprcas technology two sgrnas determine impact mutations antigenicity ifel di protein dna samples domestic cats collected amplified pcr obtain complete sequence ifel di gene throughout evolution ifel di polypeptide chain ichi proven much conserved ifel di polypeptide chain ichi therefore targeted ichi designed two singleguide rnas ichisgrna ichisgrna region using constructed sgrnas performed gene knockout fetal fibroblasts resulting two mutations within target gene following dna extracted target site product cloned using ta cloning via pcr single colony process sequenced analyze physicochemical properties antigenic sites threedimensional structure mutated protein results revealed polymorphic loci singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps found ichi ichi sequences respectively loci located gcrich intron others found exon intron exon snps guided sgrna design identifying conserved regions ichi gene gene editing efficiency ichi region dual crispr system attributed type mutation type mutation conclusion ichi significantly conserved ichi antigenicity ifel chi gene domestic cats effectively reduced crisprcas gene editing,CRISPR Gene Editing

"Glycolytic metabolism has been identified as a facilitator of tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms by which the sperm-associated antigen 4 (SPAG4)/cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-Myc)/sulfotransferase 2B1 (SULT2B1) axis regulates glycolytic metabolism and influences the viability of HT29 cells. SPAG4, c-Myc, and SULT2B1 levels were assessed in HT29 cells using Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. Moreover, overexpression and knockdown in HT29 cell models were successfully established. Furthermore, cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Various key parameters such as glucose uptake, lactate production, Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)/Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) ratio, and the expression levels of Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were determined to examine glycolytic metabolism. Additionally, the relationship between SPAG4, c-Myc, SULT2B1, and glycolysis was assessed using the immunofluorescence staining approach and 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) therapy. The expression levels of SPAG4, c-Myc, and SULT2B1 were significantly elevated in HT29 cells (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, silencing SPAG4 and c-Myc substantially reduced glycolytic metabolism and suppressed HT29 cell viability and colony formation capability (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, elevated SULT2B1 expression effectively counteracted the glycolytic reduction induced by silencing SPAG4 and c-Myc, enhancing cellular viability and colony formation capability (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In summary, SPAG4 knockdown effectively suppresses HT29 cell proliferation and colony formation ability by decreasing SULT2B1 expression through the downregulation of c-Myc, leading to the reduction of glycolytic metabolism.",Cancer Metabolism,glycolytic metabolism identified facilitator tumor cell proliferation therefore study aims investigate mechanisms spermassociated antigen spagcellular myelocytomatosis oncogene cmycsulfotransferase b sultb axis regulates glycolytic metabolism influences viability ht cells spag cmyc sultb levels assessed ht cells using quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction qrtpcr western blot analyses moreover overexpression knockdown ht cell models successfully established furthermore cell viability proliferation evaluated using cell counting kit cck colony formation assays various key parameters glucose uptake lactate production adenosine triphosphate atpadenosine diphosphate adp ratio expression levels glucose transporter glut lactate dehydrogenase ldha determined examine glycolytic metabolism additionally relationship spag cmyc sultb glycolysis assessed using immunofluorescence staining approach deoxydglucose dg therapy expression levels spag cmyc sultb significantly elevated ht cells ipi moreover silencing spag cmyc substantially reduced glycolytic metabolism suppressed ht cell viability colony formation capability ipi additionally elevated sultb expression effectively counteracted glycolytic reduction induced silencing spag cmyc enhancing cellular viability colony formation capability ipi summary spag knockdown effectively suppresses ht cell proliferation colony formation ability decreasing sultb expression downregulation cmyc leading reduction glycolytic metabolism,Cancer Metabolism
"Celastrol has been shown to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (<i>FANCD2</i>), a ferroptosis inhibitor, promotes HCC proliferation and invasion. This study aims to investigate whether Celastrol exerts its effects by targeting <i>FANCD2</i>. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified differentially expressed genes in HCC utilizing Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2). <i>FANCD2</i> and Celastrol were analyzed for molecular docking using Autodock, which was based on geometric matching and energy matching. The correlation between <i>FANCD2</i> and survival rate was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier's estimates by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. HCC cell lines (SNU-423 and SNU-387) were overexpressed or silenced with <i>FANCD2</i> and treated with Celastrol. Autophagy and ferroptosis were evaluated by measuring oxidative stress and related markers, and cell function experiments were performed. High expression of <i>FANCD2</i> was correlated with poor survival in HCC patients. Celastrol targeted <i>FANCD2</i>, reducing its level in SNU-423 and SNU-387 cells. <i>FANCD2</i> overexpression resulted in increased SNU-423 cell viability, migration, invasion, and tube formation ability, as well as attenuated autophagy and ferroptosis, while <i>FANCD2</i> knockdown in SNU-387 cells showed opposite effects. Additionally, <i>FANCD2</i> overexpression reversed the ability of Celastrol to induce autophagy and ferroptosis and to inhibit SNU-423 cell survival <i>in vitro</i>, while <i>FANCD2</i> knockdown enhanced the effects of Celastrol in SNU-387 cells.

"Microbial-derived metabolites are important mediators of host-microbial interactions. In recent years, the role of intestinal microbial metabolites in colorectal cancer has attracted considerable attention. These metabolites, which can be derived from bacterial metabolism of dietary substrates, modification of host molecules such as bile acids, or directly from bacteria, strongly influence the progression of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) by regulating inflammation and immune response. Here, we review how microbiome metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), secondary bile acids, polyamines, microbial tryptophan metabolites, and polyphenols are involved in the tumorigenesis and development of CAC through inflammation and immunity. Given the heated debate on the metabolites of microbiota in maintaining gut homeostasis, serving as tumor molecular markers, and affecting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in recent years, strategies for the prevention and treatment of CAC by targeting intestinal microbial metabolites are also discussed in this review.",Cancer Metabolism,microbialderived metabolites important mediators hostmicrobial interactions recent years role intestinal microbial metabolites colorectal cancer attracted considerable attention metabolites derived bacterial metabolism dietary substrates modification host molecules bile acids directly bacteria strongly influence progression colitisassociated cancer cac regulating inflammation immune response review microbiome metabolites shortchain fatty acids scfas secondary bile acids polyamines microbial tryptophan metabolites polyphenols involved tumorigenesis development cac inflammation immunity given heated debate metabolites microbiota maintaining gut homeostasis serving tumor molecular markers affecting efficacy immune checkpoint inhibitors recent years strategies prevention treatment cac targeting intestinal microbial metabolites also discussed review,Cancer Metabolism
"YEATS2, an evolutionarily conserved reader of histone acylation marks (H3K27ac, H3K27cr, H3K27bz), functions as a central oncogenic driver in diverse cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its structurally plastic YEATS domain bridges acyl-CoA metabolism to chromatin remodeling, amplifying transcription of survival genes such as MYC, BCL2, and PD-L1. YEATS2 orchestrates malignancy-specific programs-sustaining ribosome biogenesis in NSCLC through ATAC complex recruitment, enhancing NF-κB-dependent immune evasion in PDAC, and activating PI3K/AKT-driven metabolic rewiring in HCC. Structural studies demonstrate a unique aromatic cage architecture that selectively engages diverse acylated histones. Although pyrazolopyridine-based inhibitors targeting the YEATS domain show preclinical efficacy, developing isoform-selective agents remains challenging. Clinically, YEATS2 overexpression correlates with therapy resistance and may synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. This review integrates mechanistic insights into the role of YEATS2 in epigenetic regulation, evaluates its therapeutic potential, and proposes future directions: elucidating full-length complex topologies, mapping synthetic lethal interactors, and optimizing selective inhibitors.

"While growing evidence highlights the role of gut microbiota and inflammatory proteins in cancer, with cancer-related inflammation now considered the seventh hallmark of cancer, the direct causal relationships between specific microbiota, cancer, and the potential mediating effects of inflammatory proteins have not been fully established. We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationships between gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins, and eighteen distinct cancers using data from extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The primary statistical method utilized was inverse variance weighting (IVW). We also investigated whether inflammatory proteins could mediate the effects of gut microbiota on cancer development. Our findings revealed 42 positive and 49 inverse causal impacts of gut microbiota on cancer risk (P < 0.05). Additionally, we identified 32 positive and 28 inverse causal relationships between inflammatory proteins and cancer risk. Moreover, genus Collinsella decreased the risk of lung cancer by decreasing levels of T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5 (mediating effect = 16.667%), while genus Ruminococcaceae UCG005 increased the risk of mesothelioma by increasing levels of CCL4 (mediating effect = 5.134%). Our study provides evidence for a causal association between gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins, and eighteen different cancer types.

"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is the master orchestrator of the heat shock response (HSR), a critical process for maintaining cellular health and protein homeostasis. These effects are achieved through rapid expression of molecular chaperones, the heat shock proteins (HSPs), which ensure correct protein folding, repair, degradation and stabilization of multiprotein complexes. In addition to its role in the HSR, HSF1 influences the cell cycle, including processes such as S phase progression and regulation of the p53 pathway, highlighting its importance in cellular protein synthesis and division. While HSF1 activity offers neuroprotective benefits in neurodegenerative diseases, its proteome-stabilizing function may also reinforce tumorigenic transformation. HSF1 overexpression in many types of cancer reportedly enhances cell growth enables survival, alters metabolism, weakens immune response and promotes angiogenesis or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as these cells enter a form of ""HSF1 addiction"". Furthermore, the client proteins of HSF1-regulated chaperones, particularly Hsp90, include numerous key players in classical tumorigenic pathways.

"Heterozygous histone H3.3K27M mutation is a primary oncogenic driver of Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG). H3.3K27M inhibits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase activity, leading to global reduction and redistribution of the repressive H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3). This epigenomic rewiring is thought to promote gliomagenesis, but the precise role of K27M in gene regulation and tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. We established isogenic DMG patient-derived cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to create H3.3 wild-type (WT), H3.3K27M, and combinations with EZH2 and EZH1 co-deletion, thereby eliminating PRC2 function and H3K27me3. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis revealed that K27M exerts a novel epigenetic effect independent of PRC2 inhibition. While PRC2 loss led to widespread gene induction including HOX gene clusters, and activation of biological pathways, K27M induced a balanced gene deregulation with an overall repressive effect on pathway activity. Genes uniquely affected by K27M, independent of PRC2 loss, showed concordant changes in chromatin accessibility, with upregulated genes becoming more accessible. Importantly, xenografts of H3.3K27M/EZH1/2 WT cells formed tumors, whereas /EZH1/2 knockout cells did not, demonstrating a PRC2-independent role of K27M in tumorigenesis. Our findings reveal that the H3.3K27M mutation alters chromatin accessibility and uniquely deregulates gene expression independent of H3K27 methylation loss. These PRC2-independent functions of K27M contribute to changes in biological pathway activity and are necessary for tumor development, highlighting novel mechanisms of K27M-driven gliomagenesis.",Cancer Metabolism,heterozygous histone hkm mutation primary oncogenic driver diffuse midline glioma dmg hkm inhibits polycomb repressive complex prc methyltransferase activity leading global reduction redistribution repressive h lysine trimethylation hkme epigenomic rewiring thought promote gliomagenesis precise role km gene regulation tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood established isogenic dmg patientderived cell lines using crisprcas editing create h wildtype wt hkm combinations ezh ezh codeletion thereby eliminating prc function hkme rnaseq atacseq analysis revealed km exerts novel epigenetic effect independent prc inhibition prc loss led widespread gene induction including hox gene clusters activation biological pathways km induced balanced gene deregulation overall repressive effect pathway activity genes uniquely affected km independent prc loss showed concordant changes chromatin accessibility upregulated genes becoming accessible importantly xenografts hkmezh wt cells formed tumors whereas ezh knockout cells demonstrating prcindependent role km tumorigenesis findings reveal hkm mutation alters chromatin accessibility uniquely deregulates gene expression independent hk methylation loss prcindependent functions km contribute changes biological pathway activity necessary tumor development highlighting novel mechanisms kmdriven gliomagenesis,Cancer Metabolism
"TYRO3, MERTK, and AXL receptor tyrosine kinases, collectively known as TAM receptors, play a vital role in maintaining lung tissue homeostasis by regulating integrity and self-renewal. These receptors activate signalling pathways that inhibit apoptosis, promote cell proliferation and differentiation, mediate cell adhesion and migration, and perform other essential biological functions. Additionally, TAM receptors are implicated in mechanisms that suppress anti-tumor immunity and confer resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Disruption of the homeostatic balances can lead to pathological conditions such as lung inflammation, fibrosis, or tumors. Recent studies highlight their significant role in COVID-19-induced lung injury. However, the exact mechanisms by which TAM receptors contribute to lung diseases remain unclear.

"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are clinically approved drugs for the treatment of hematological malignancies synergizing with chemotherapy. However, despite the long history of HDACi, the mechanistic underpinnings of this synergism have remained unclear. Using transmission electron microscopy, we identified autophagy and ER-stress in HDACi-treated cells. We quantified ER-phagy and ER-stress with reporter systems by using 3D-deconvolution microscopy and flow cytometry. We complemented these data with qPCR and Western blot results. Apoptosis rates were assessed using a caspase assay and flow cytometry, and large public datasets were utilized. HDAC blockade results in specific upregulation of the selective autophagy receptor FAM134B (RETREG1) and the induction of ER-phagy. Combined with the chemotherapeutic drug Gemcitabine, this results in subsequent elevated ER-stress levels and apoptosis. Inhibiting the distinct ER-stress branches fully rescues this process. Broadening the scope of these findings, certain non-HDAC-inhibitory and clinically approved compounds like Loperamide and Nelfinavir are able to induce FAM134B and could hence constitute novel Gemcitabine-synergizing molecules. Additionally, pancreatic cancer patients with high FAM134B expression have significantly longer survival rates under chemotherapy. In summary, we provide mechanistic evidence for ER-phagy playing a hitherto unknown central role in the clinical synergy between HDACi and chemotherapy.",Cancer Metabolism,histone deacetylase inhibitors hdaci clinically approved drugs treatment hematological malignancies synergizing chemotherapy however despite long history hdaci mechanistic underpinnings synergism remained unclear using transmission electron microscopy identified autophagy erstress hdacitreated cells quantified erphagy erstress reporter systems using ddeconvolution microscopy flow cytometry complemented data qpcr western blot results apoptosis rates assessed using caspase assay flow cytometry large public datasets utilized hdac blockade results specific upregulation selective autophagy receptor famb retreg induction erphagy combined chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine results subsequent elevated erstress levels apoptosis inhibiting distinct erstress branches fully rescues process broadening scope findings certain nonhdacinhibitory clinically approved compounds like loperamide nelfinavir able induce famb could hence constitute novel gemcitabinesynergizing molecules additionally pancreatic cancer patients high famb expression significantly longer survival rates chemotherapy summary provide mechanistic evidence erphagy playing hitherto unknown central role clinical synergy hdaci chemotherapy,Cancer Metabolism
"Analgesic treatment is the primary method for managing acute postoperative pain. Opioid analgesics are the main class of drugs used to treat moderate to severe pain, whether it is acute or chronic. These opioids differ in various ways, including their pharmacochemical properties, distribution and absorption rates, metabolism, and elimination pathways for the drug and its metabolites. These differences result in varying degrees of analgesic efficacy, which, in clinical practice, allows for the selection of the most effective drug that maximizes pain relief while ensuring safety. Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid with properties that are not yet fully understood. It has a wide range of applications in treating both acute and chronic pain, including non-cancer and cancer-related pain. One of the most significant clinical advantages of buprenorphine is its safety profile, which includes a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, no immunosuppressive effects, inhibition of hyperalgesia, no cumulative effects in patients with renal failure, and a low risk of constipation following its use. This study aims to analyze current reports on the use of intravenous buprenorphine as a first-line opioid analgesic for postoperative pain relief. The paper discusses the pharmacochemical properties of the drug and the mechanisms behind postoperative pain. Additionally, it presents the experiences of the pain management team at Copernicus Hospital in Gdansk regarding administering intravenous buprenorphine. The current literature on buprenorphine for treating moderate to severe acute pain has been reviewed, focusing on its effectiveness in managing postoperative pain following surgical procedures. Additionally, the experience of the Copernicus Hospital pain team with buprenorphine is summarized in a brief discussion.

"Understanding cellular diversity and disease mechanisms requires a global analysis of proteins and their modifications. While next-generation sequencing has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, it fails to capture downstream signalling networks. Ultrasensitive mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables unbiased protein-level analysis of low cell numbers, down to single cells. However, phosphoproteomics remains limited to high-input samples due to sample losses and poor reaction efficiencies associated with processing low cell numbers. Isobaric stable isotope labelling is a promising approach for reproducible and accurate quantification of low abundant phosphopeptides. Here, we introduce SPARCE (Streamlined Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Rare CElls) for multiplexed phosphoproteomic analysis of low cell numbers. SPARCE integrates cell isolation, water-based lysis, on-tip TMT labelling, and phosphopeptide enrichment. SPARCE outperforms traditional methods by enhancing labelling efficiency and phosphoproteome coverage. To demonstrate the utility of SPARCE, we analysed four patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell lines, reliably quantifying phosphosite changes from 1000 FACS-sorted cells. This workflow expands the possibilities for signalling analysis of rare cell populations.",Cancer Metabolism,understanding cellular diversity disease mechanisms requires global analysis proteins modifications nextgeneration sequencing advanced understanding cellular heterogeneity fails capture downstream signalling networks ultrasensitive mass spectrometrybased proteomics enables unbiased proteinlevel analysis low cell numbers single cells however phosphoproteomics remains limited highinput samples due sample losses poor reaction efficiencies associated processing low cell numbers isobaric stable isotope labelling promising approach reproducible accurate quantification low abundant phosphopeptides introduce sparce streamlined phosphoproteomic analysis rare cells multiplexed phosphoproteomic analysis low cell numbers sparce integrates cell isolation waterbased lysis ontip tmt labelling phosphopeptide enrichment sparce outperforms traditional methods enhancing labelling efficiency phosphoproteome coverage demonstrate utility sparce analysed four patientderived glioblastoma stem cell lines reliably quantifying phosphosite changes facssorted cells workflow expands possibilities signalling analysis rare cell populations,Cancer Metabolism
"Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common malignant tumor of digestive tract and lactate metabolism has been linked to tumor development and progression. In this study, we sought to investigate the influence of lactate metabolism-related genes (LRGs) prognosis. We also aimed to identify distinct LRG-related clusters and develop a risk signature for assessing patient prognosis, immunological characteristics, and response to therapy. We analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to reveal the expression and mutational features of LRGs in COAD patients. In the integrated TCGA and GSE39582 cohort, consensus clustering analysis was employed to classify patients into two distinct LRG-related clusters. Using differentially expressed genes (DRGs) from these two clusters, we established a LRG-related gene cluster and prognostic signature which was used to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. An validation cohort was used to validate the predictive ability of risk signature and expression of 6 candidate LRGs was confirmed through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Nomograms were created to visually represent the clinical value of LRG-related signature. Furthermore, we extensively examined differences in immune cell infiltration, tumor mutational load (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) and drug sensitivity between two risk groups. Analysis of the integrated TCGA and GSE39582 cohorts revealed two distinct LRG-related clusters and gene clusters with significant differences in overall survival (OS) and tumor microenvironment. We developed a LRG-related signature comprising 6 candidate LRGs that reliably predicted OS and qRT-PCR validation confirmed the expression of LRGs. Based on the median risk score, patients were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups, with low-risk group showing better survival. Furthermore, patients in high-risk group were more sensitive to chemotherapy and associated with higher TMB, higher proportion of MSI-H.

"Accurate and early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical for improving patient outcomes. Current biomarkers like AFP have limited sensitivity, necessitating novel diagnostic markers. A novel semi-nested RT-PCR assay was developed to quantify circulating Ceruloplasmin (CP) mRNA in peripheral blood. This method co-amplifies CP mRNA and an internal control (IC) gene, followed by DNA melting analysis to distinguish and quantify CP mRNA. CP mRNA levels were significantly higher in the HCC group (median: 3.37) compared to both the CLD group (0.24, p = 0.0066) and the HD group (0.17, p < 0.0001). Further analysis using ROC curves highlighted the diagnostic performance of the assay. For differentiating HCC from CLD, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.704, with 50.98% sensitivity and 95.24% specificity. In comparison to HD, the AUC was 0.812, with 74.51% sensitivity and 80.65% specificity. Against the combined control group (CLD and HD), the AUC was 0.768, with 50.98% sensitivity and 96.15% specificity. Additionally, in 59.1% of HCC cases with AFP levels below 20 ng/mL, CP mRNA levels were elevated, indicating that CP mRNA could help detect a substantial proportion of AFP-negative HCC cases. This study, the first comprehensive clinical investigation of cell-free CP mRNA for HCC diagnosis, demonstrates its potential as a sensitive and specific non-invasive biomarker.

"One of the main characteristics of tumor metabolite reprogramming is enhanced glycolysis, and Pyruvate Kinase M2(PKM2) is a crucial enzyme that limits the pace of glycometabolism. Although PKM2 has been proven to affect the development of some cancers, a pan-cancer analysis of PKM2 has not yet been performed. We analyzed the expression and prognosis of PKM2 in pan-cancer using multiple databases. We performed epigenetic, functional enrichment, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint, and drug sensitivity analyses of PKM2. PKM2 was found to be significantly upregulated in most malignancies and associated with a bad prognosis. In some cancers, the PKM2 DNA promoter was hypomethylated. The expression of PKM2 was positively linked with most m6A-methylation-related genes in pan-cancer. The functions of PKM2 were primarily associated with the regulation of the immune system, glycolysis, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PKM2 was favorably associated with neutrophils and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment of most cancers. Importantly, PKM2 showed a strikingly high correlation with CD274 (PD-L1), CD276, TGF-β1, VEGFA, and HAVCR2 in most cancers. Finally, using experiments, it was confirmed that silencing PKM2 could increase the sensitivity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to cisplatin by regulating autophagy.

"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a multifactorial disease characterized by hepatic steatosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in the incomplete digestion of surplus fat is one of the key factors that lead to hepatic steatosis but the reason for this remains unclear. We investigated the role of neurotensin (NTS), a gut hormone, in inducing maladaptive fat metabolism in steatotic liver. We identify CD36 and PGC1α, two critical drivers of MASLD, as direct NTS signaling targets in the liver. NTS upregulates CD36, a free fatty acid receptor, in hepatocytes and promotes long chain lipid uptake. Conversely, NTS inhibits PGC1α, which acts as a lipid sensor and translocates to the nucleus to activate lipid catabolism-related genes in an AMPK-dependent manner. Thus, a high fat diet decreases the fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation capacity of the liver and hepatocytes from NTS or NTS receptor 1 (NTSR1) wild type mice; whereas NTS deficiency preserves the lipid metabolism capacity of the liver. NTS signaling is significantly upregulated in MASLD and in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) human liver samples when compared to normal livers, which correlates with the expression of CD36 and oxidative phosphorylation proteins. These findings provide critical mechanistic insights into the maladaptive fat metabolism noted with steatosis in mice and humans and suggest novel strategies for therapeutic intervention of MASLD, which affects nearly one-quarter of the global population.",Cancer Metabolism,metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease masld multifactorial disease characterized hepatic steatosis mitochondrial dysfunction resulting incomplete digestion surplus fat one key factors lead hepatic steatosis reason remains unclear investigated role neurotensin nts gut hormone inducing maladaptive fat metabolism steatotic liver identify cd pgc two critical drivers masld direct nts signaling targets liver nts upregulates cd free fatty acid receptor hepatocytes promotes long chain lipid uptake conversely nts inhibits pgc acts lipid sensor translocates nucleus activate lipid catabolismrelated genes ampkdependent manner thus high fat diet decreases fatty acid oxidation oxidative phosphorylation capacity liver hepatocytes nts nts receptor ntsr wild type mice whereas nts deficiency preserves lipid metabolism capacity liver nts signaling significantly upregulated masld metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis mash human liver samples compared normal livers correlates expression cd oxidative phosphorylation proteins findings provide critical mechanistic insights maladaptive fat metabolism noted steatosis mice humans suggest novel strategies therapeutic intervention masld affects nearly onequarter global population,Cancer Metabolism
"Incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing likely due to different mechanisms driving initiation and progression. The initial model proposed by Fearon and Vogelstein posits it as a multi-hit neoplasia, originating from adenomatous-polyps induced by WNT activation, ultimately progressing to aggressiveness through p53 loss. Integrating human data with mouse genetics, we redefine this paradigm, highlighting pivotal roles of MYC, oncogenic URI and p53 degradation to initiate CRC. Early APC loss activates MYC to transcriptionally upregulate URI, which modulates MDM2 activity, triggering p53 proteasomal degradation, essential for tumour initiation and mutation burden accrual in CRC mice. Remarkably, reinstating p53 levels via genetic URI depletion or p53 super-expression in CRC mice with WNT pathway activation prevents tumour initiation and extends lifespan. Our data reveal a ""two-hit"" genetic model central to APC loss-driven CRC initiation, wherein MYC/URI axis intricately controls p53 degradation, offering mechanistic insights into transitional mutation acquisition essential for CRC progression.",Cancer Metabolism,incidence colorectal cancer crc increasing likely due different mechanisms driving initiation progression initial model proposed fearon vogelstein posits multihit neoplasia originating adenomatouspolyps induced wnt activation ultimately progressing aggressiveness p loss integrating human data mouse genetics redefine paradigm highlighting pivotal roles myc oncogenic uri p degradation initiate crc early apc loss activates myc transcriptionally upregulate uri modulates mdm activity triggering p proteasomal degradation essential tumour initiation mutation burden accrual crc mice remarkably reinstating p levels via genetic uri depletion p superexpression crc mice wnt pathway activation prevents tumour initiation extends lifespan data reveal twohit genetic model central apc lossdriven crc initiation wherein mycuri axis intricately controls p degradation offering mechanistic insights transitional mutation acquisition essential crc progression,Cancer Metabolism
"Members of the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play critical roles in processes like hemostasis, thrombosis, development, wound healing, inflammation, and cancer progression. Comprising PAR1-PAR4, these receptors are specifically activated by protease cleavage at their extracellular amino terminus, revealing a 'tethered ligand' that self-activates the receptor. This triggers complex intracellular signaling via G proteins and beta-arrestins, linking external protease signals to cellular functions. To date, direct structural visualization of these ligand-receptor complexes has been limited. Here, we present structural snapshots of activated PAR1 and PAR2 bound to their endogenous tethered ligands, revealing a shallow and constricted orthosteric binding pocket. Comparisons with antagonist-bound structures show minimal conformational changes in the TM6 helix and larger movements of TM7 upon activation. These findings reveal a common activation mechanism for PAR1 and PAR2, highlighting critical residues involved in ligand recognition. Additionally, the structure of PAR2 bound to a pathway selective antagonist, GB88, demonstrates how potent orthosteric engagement can be achieved by a small molecule mimicking the endogenous tethered ligand's interactions.",Cancer Metabolism,members proteinaseactivated receptor par subfamily g proteincoupled receptors gpcrs play critical roles processes like hemostasis thrombosis development wound healing inflammation cancer progression comprising parpar receptors specifically activated protease cleavage extracellular amino terminus revealing tethered ligand selfactivates receptor triggers complex intracellular signaling via g proteins betaarrestins linking external protease signals cellular functions date direct structural visualization ligandreceptor complexes limited present structural snapshots activated par par bound endogenous tethered ligands revealing shallow constricted orthosteric binding pocket comparisons antagonistbound structures show minimal conformational changes tm helix larger movements tm upon activation findings reveal common activation mechanism par par highlighting critical residues involved ligand recognition additionally structure par bound pathway selective antagonist gb demonstrates potent orthosteric engagement achieved small molecule mimicking endogenous tethered ligands interactions,Cancer Metabolism
"Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), shows promise in the treatment of breast cancer (BC); however, drug resistance limits its clinical application. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), which is overexpressed in many tumor types, plays a key role in tumor metastasis and drug resistance. The involvement of MMP1 in SG resistance in metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR + ) BC has not been previously reported. In this study, we employed various in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of MMP1 in SG resistance in BC. MMP1 expression was manipulated in different BC cell lines through lentiviral transfection and small interfering RNA techniques. Key methodologies included Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and RNA sequencing to assess marker expression and identify differentially expressed genes. Functional assays were conducted to evaluate cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and migration. In vivo, a cell-derived xenograft model in nude mice was utilized to assess tumor growth and drug response. Bioinformatics analyses further explored MMP1 expression and its clinical relevance across different cancer types. Our findings indicate that MMP1 is overexpressed by approximately 30-fold in HR + BC tissues and is associated with poorer prognosis among HR + BC patients. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that HR + BC with high MMP1 expression displays resistance to SG, supporting the hypothesis that MMP1 plays a key role in regulating ADC resistance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MMP1 can activate the NF-κB pathway, which subsequently influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to SG resistance. Ultimately, our research underscores the potential of MMP1 as a therapeutic target and biomarker, facilitating personalized treatment strategies that could enhance patient outcomes in BC therapy.",Cancer Metabolism,sacituzumab govitecan sg novel antibodydrug conjugate adc shows promise treatment breast cancer bc however drug resistance limits clinical application matrix metalloproteinase mmp overexpressed many tumor types plays key role tumor metastasis drug resistance involvement mmp sg resistance metastatic hormone receptorpositive hr bc previously reported study employed various vitro vivo approaches investigate role mmp sg resistance bc mmp expression manipulated different bc cell lines lentiviral transfection small interfering rna techniques key methodologies included western blot quantitative reverse transcription pcr rna sequencing assess marker expression identify differentially expressed genes functional assays conducted evaluate cell viability proliferation invasion migration vivo cellderived xenograft model nude mice utilized assess tumor growth drug response bioinformatics analyses explored mmp expression clinical relevance across different cancer types findings indicate mmp overexpressed approximately fold hr bc tissues associated poorer prognosis among hr bc patients furthermore analysis reveals hr bc high mmp expression displays resistance sg supporting hypothesis mmp plays key role regulating adc resistance mechanistic studies demonstrate mmp activate nfb pathway subsequently influences epithelialmesenchymal transition thereby contributing sg resistance ultimately research underscores potential mmp therapeutic target biomarker facilitating personalized treatment strategies could enhance patient outcomes bc therapy,Cancer Metabolism
"Selective inheritance of sub-cellular components has emerged as a mechanism guiding stem cell fate after asymmetric cell divisions. Peroxisomes play a crucial role in multiple metabolic processes such as fatty acid metabolism and reactive oxygen species detoxification, but the apportioning of peroxisomes during stem cell division remains understudied. Here, we develop a mouse model and labeling technique to follow the dynamics of distinct peroxisome age-classes, and find that old peroxisomes are inherited by the daughter cell retaining full stem cell potency in mammary and epidermal stem cell divisions. Old peroxisomes carry Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, whose specific location on the peroxisomal membrane promotes stem cell function by facilitating peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis. Our study demonstrates age-selective apportioning of peroxisomes in vivo, and unveils how functional heterogeneity of peroxisomes is utilized by asymmetrically dividing cells to metabolically divert the fate of the two daughter cells.",Cancer Metabolism,selective inheritance subcellular components emerged mechanism guiding stem cell fate asymmetric cell divisions peroxisomes play crucial role multiple metabolic processes fatty acid metabolism reactive oxygen species detoxification apportioning peroxisomes stem cell division remains understudied develop mouse model labeling technique follow dynamics distinct peroxisome ageclasses find old peroxisomes inherited daughter cell retaining full stem cell potency mammary epidermal stem cell divisions old peroxisomes carry glucosephosphatedehydrogenase whose specific location peroxisomal membrane promotes stem cell function facilitating peroxisomal ether lipid synthesis study demonstrates ageselective apportioning peroxisomes vivo unveils functional heterogeneity peroxisomes utilized asymmetrically dividing cells metabolically divert fate two daughter cells,Cancer Metabolism
"Metastasis is a lethal disease of cancer, spreading from primary tumors to the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which disseminate to distant organs at low efficiency for secondary tumor regeneration, thereby contributing to unfavorable patient outcomes. The detection of dynamic CTC alterations can be indicative of cancer progression (residual cancer, aggressiveness, therapy resistance) or regression (therapy response), serving as biomarkers for diagnoses and prognoses. CTC heterogeneity is impacted by both intrinsic oncogenic changes and extrinsic microenvironmental factors (e.g. the immune system and circadian rhythm), altering the genomic/genetic, epigenomic/epigenetic, proteomic, post-translational, and metabolomic landscapes. In addition to homeostatic dynamics, regenerative stemness, and metabolic plasticity, a newly discovered feature of CTCs that influences metastatic outcomes is its intercellular clustering. While the dogma suggests that CTCs play solo as single cells in the circulation, CTCs can orchestrate with other CTCs or white blood cells to form homotypic or heterotypic multi-cellular clusters, with 20-100 times enhanced metastatic potential than single CTCs. CTC clusters promote cell survival and stemness through DNA hypomethylation and signaling pathways activated by clustering-driving proteins (CD44, CD81, ICAM1, Podocalyxin, etc). Heterotypic CTC clusters may protect CTCs from immune cell attacks if not being cleared by cytotoxic immune cells. This chapter mainly focused on CTC biology related to multi-omic features and metastatic outcomes. We speculate that CTCs could guide therapeutic targeting and be targeted specifically by anti-CTC therapeutics to reduce or eliminate cancer and cancer metastasis.",Cancer Metabolism,metastasis lethal disease cancer spreading primary tumors bloodstream circulating tumor cells ctcs disseminate distant organs low efficiency secondary tumor regeneration thereby contributing unfavorable patient outcomes detection dynamic ctc alterations indicative cancer progression residual cancer aggressiveness therapy resistance regression therapy response serving biomarkers diagnoses prognoses ctc heterogeneity impacted intrinsic oncogenic changes extrinsic microenvironmental factors eg immune system circadian rhythm altering genomicgenetic epigenomicepigenetic proteomic posttranslational metabolomic landscapes addition homeostatic dynamics regenerative stemness metabolic plasticity newly discovered feature ctcs influences metastatic outcomes intercellular clustering dogma suggests ctcs play solo single cells circulation ctcs orchestrate ctcs white blood cells form homotypic heterotypic multicellular clusters times enhanced metastatic potential single ctcs ctc clusters promote cell survival stemness dna hypomethylation signaling pathways activated clusteringdriving proteins cd cd icam podocalyxin etc heterotypic ctc clusters may protect ctcs immune cell attacks cleared cytotoxic immune cells chapter mainly focused ctc biology related multiomic features metastatic outcomes speculate ctcs could guide therapeutic targeting targeted specifically antictc therapeutics reduce eliminate cancer cancer metastasis,Cancer Metabolism
"DNA methylation is one of the best-known epigenetic markers and plays a critical role in the control of gene activity and the architecture of the nucleus of the cell. Epigenetic alterations and especially DNA methylation have a high potential to provide valuable and innovative cancer biomarkers. Liquid biopsy is a unique minimally invasive tool for the management of cancer patients based on the extraction of information through detailed molecular analysis of circulating genetic material in peripheral blood and allows us to characterize the evolution of a solid tumor in real time. DNA methylation in combination with liquid biopsy is very powerful when it comes to providing circulating epigenetic biomarkers of clinical importance. Numerous DNA methylation markers are now being tested in liquid biopsies as potential biomarkers in various types of cancer. DNA methylation is mostly being studied in ctDNA but there are also a small number of studies up to now performed in gDNA isolated from CTCs. A highly important dimension of the combination of liquid biopsy/DNA methylation analysis is its high potential for early cancer detection since alterations in DNA methylation in plasma can be detected very early during cancer pathogenesis. Methylated DNA, modified nucleosomes and noncoding RNAs can be used as blood circulating epigenetic biomarkers for real-time and minimally-invasive cancer monitoring. DNA methylation is very promising and powerful in providing novel biomarkers for improving cancer diagnostics, while another important dimension in this field is the use of DNA methylation inhibitors in cancer treatment.

"Circulating tumor cells (CTC), released by primary tumors into the bloodstream, represent a valuable source to inform on cancer heterogeneity, cancer progression, metastatic disease and therapy efficacy without the need of invasive tumor biopsies. However, the extreme rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs, occurring at genotypic, phenotypic and functional levels, poses a major challenge for the study of this population and explains the lack of standardized strategies of CTC isolation. Lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, is a paradigmatic example of how CTC heterogeneity can undermine the clinical utility of this biomarker, since contrasting data have been reported using different isolation technologies. Some evidences suggest that only a fraction of CTC, characterized by stem-like feature and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, can sustain metastasis initiation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the potential to maintain primary tumors, initiate metastasis and escape both chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments. Moreover, a close connection has been reported in several tumor types among hybrid phenotype, characterized by retention of epithelial and mesenchymal traits, acquisition of CSC feature and increased metastatic potential. This review focuses on the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of CTCs and the resulting implications for their isolation and clinical validation, especially in the setting of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we discuss the most relevant studies providing evidence for the presence and prognostic/predictive value of CTC subsets characterized by stem-like and hybrid EMT phenotype. Despite technical and conceptual issues, tracking circulating CSCs has the potential to improve the prognostic/predictive value of CTCs in NSCLC setting and could provide novel insights into the comprehension of the metastatic process and identification of novel therapeutic targets.",Cancer Metabolism,circulating tumor cells ctc released primary tumors bloodstream represent valuable source inform cancer heterogeneity cancer progression metastatic disease therapy efficacy without need invasive tumor biopsies however extreme rarity heterogeneity ctcs occurring genotypic phenotypic functional levels poses major challenge study population explains lack standardized strategies ctc isolation lung cancer leading causes cancerrelated death worldwide paradigmatic example ctc heterogeneity undermine clinical utility biomarker since contrasting data reported using different isolation technologies evidences suggest fraction ctc characterized stemlike feature partial epithelialmesenchymal transition emt phenotype sustain metastasis initiation cancer stem cells cscs potential maintain primary tumors initiate metastasis escape chemotherapy immunotherapy treatments moreover close connection reported several tumor types among hybrid phenotype characterized retention epithelial mesenchymal traits acquisition csc feature increased metastatic potential review focuses phenotypic functional heterogeneity ctcs resulting implications isolation clinical validation especially setting nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc particular discuss relevant studies providing evidence presence prognosticpredictive value ctc subsets characterized stemlike hybrid emt phenotype despite technical conceptual issues tracking circulating cscs potential improve prognosticpredictive value ctcs nsclc setting could provide novel insights comprehension metastatic process identification novel therapeutic targets,Cancer Metabolism

"Environmental stressors in the modern world can fundamentally affect human physiology and health. Exposure to stressors like air pollution, heat, and traffic noise has been linked to a pronounced increase in non-communicable diseases. Specifically, aircraft noise has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, heart failure, stroke, and diabetes. Noise stress leads to neuronal activation with subsequent stress hormone release that ultimately activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases inflammation and oxidative stress thus substantially affecting the cardiovascular system. However, despite the epidemiological evidence of a link between noise stress and metabolic dysfunction, the consequences of exposure at the molecular, metabolic level of the cardiovascular system are largely unknown. Here, we use a murine model system of short-term aircraft noise exposure to show that noise stress profoundly alters heart metabolism. Within 4 days of noise exposure, the heart proteome and metabolome bear the hallmarks of reduced potential for generating ATP from fatty-acid beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. This is accompanied by the increased expression of glycolytic metabolites, including the end-product, lactate, suggesting a compensatory shift of energy production towards anaerobic glycolysis. Intriguingly, the metabolic shift is reminiscent of what is observed in failing and ischaemic hearts. Mechanistically, we further show that the metabolic rewiring is likely driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS), as we can rescue the phenotype by knocking out NOX-2/gp91phox, a ROS inducer, in mice. Our results suggest that within a short exposure time, the cardiovascular system undergoes a fundamental metabolic shift that bears the hallmarks of cardiovascular disease. These findings underscore the urgent need to comprehend the molecular consequences of environmental stressors, paving the way for targeted interventions to mitigate health risks associated with chronic noise exposure in modern, environments heavily disturbed by noise pollution.",Cancer Metabolism,environmental stressors modern world fundamentally affect human physiology health exposure stressors like air pollution heat traffic noise linked pronounced increase noncommunicable diseases specifically aircraft noise identified risk factor cardiovascular metabolic diseases arteriosclerosis heart failure stroke diabetes noise stress leads neuronal activation subsequent stress hormone release ultimately activates reninangiotensinaldosterone system increases inflammation oxidative stress thus substantially affecting cardiovascular system however despite epidemiological evidence link noise stress metabolic dysfunction consequences exposure molecular metabolic level cardiovascular system largely unknown use murine model system shortterm aircraft noise exposure show noise stress profoundly alters heart metabolism within days noise exposure heart proteome metabolome bear hallmarks reduced potential generating atp fattyacid betaoxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle electron transport chain accompanied increased expression glycolytic metabolites including endproduct lactate suggesting compensatory shift energy production towards anaerobic glycolysis intriguingly metabolic shift reminiscent observed failing ischaemic hearts mechanistically show metabolic rewiring likely driven reactive oxygen species ros rescue phenotype knocking noxgpphox ros inducer mice results suggest within short exposure time cardiovascular system undergoes fundamental metabolic shift bears hallmarks cardiovascular disease findings underscore urgent need comprehend molecular consequences environmental stressors paving way targeted interventions mitigate health risks associated chronic noise exposure modern environments heavily disturbed noise pollution,Cancer Metabolism
"Cerebral microdialysis in rodents represents a robust and versatile technique for quantifying the pharmacologically relevant unbound fraction of drugs in the brain. When this unbound fraction is simultaneously determined in plasma, it facilitates the calculation of the corresponding unbound plasma-to-brain partition coefficient (K<sub>p,uu</sub>) for a given compound in vivo. This coefficient is critical for understanding the penetration and distribution of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, obtaining valid and accurate microdialysis data can be particularly challenging for hydrophobic drugs due to their pronounced non-specific interactions with the components of the microdialysis system. The present study reports the outcomes of comprehensive microdialysis investigations in rodents, focusing on three hydrophobic compounds: actinomycin D, selinexor, and ulixertinib. These compounds exhibited varying degrees of non-specific binding to the surfaces of the microdialysis apparatus, leading to low recovery rates and substantial carry-over effects. To diminish these limitations, strategies such as surface coating and the use of optimized materials were employed to enhance the reliability of the microdialysis system. To ensure the robustness and reproducibility of microdialysis-related research outcomes, our experimental findings were supplemented with a narrative literature review. This review encompassed keyword-driven PubMed-indexed publications on microdialysis from 1970 to 2024, providing a broader context for the challenges and solutions associated with the technique. By integrating empirical results with practical recommendations, this study offers a comprehensive resource aimed at advancing the application of cerebral microdialysis in preclinical drug development, particularly for compounds with challenging physicochemical properties.",Cancer Metabolism,cerebral microdialysis rodents represents robust versatile technique quantifying pharmacologically relevant unbound fraction drugs brain unbound fraction simultaneously determined plasma facilitates calculation corresponding unbound plasmatobrain partition coefficient ksubpuusub given compound vivo coefficient critical understanding penetration distribution drugs across bloodbrain barrier bbb however obtaining valid accurate microdialysis data particularly challenging hydrophobic drugs due pronounced nonspecific interactions components microdialysis system present study reports outcomes comprehensive microdialysis investigations rodents focusing three hydrophobic compounds actinomycin selinexor ulixertinib compounds exhibited varying degrees nonspecific binding surfaces microdialysis apparatus leading low recovery rates substantial carryover effects diminish limitations strategies surface coating use optimized materials employed enhance reliability microdialysis system ensure robustness reproducibility microdialysisrelated research outcomes experimental findings supplemented narrative literature review review encompassed keyworddriven pubmedindexed publications microdialysis providing broader context challenges solutions associated technique integrating empirical results practical recommendations study offers comprehensive resource aimed advancing application cerebral microdialysis preclinical drug development particularly compounds challenging physicochemical properties,Cancer Metabolism
"Endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer is important for cancer cell survival, but the role of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake through the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is poorly understood. Here, we show that increased MCU expression is associated with malignancy and poorer outcomes in patients with PDAC. In isogenic murine PDAC models, Mcu deletion (Mcu<sup>KO</sup>) ablated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, which reduced proliferation and inhibited self-renewal. Orthotopic implantation of MCU-null tumor cells reduced primary tumor growth and metastasis. Mcu deletion reduced the cellular plasticity of tumor cells by inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which contributes to metastatic competency in PDAC. Mechanistically, the loss of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake reduced the expression of the key EMT transcription factor Snail and secretion of the EMT-inducing ligand TGF-β. Snail re-expression and TGF-β treatment rescued deficits in Mcu<sup>KO</sup> cells and restored their metastatic ability. Thus, MCU may present a therapeutic target in PDAC to limit cancer-cell-induced EMT and metastasis.",Cancer Metabolism,endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria casupsup transfer important cancer cell survival role mitochondrial casupsup uptake mitochondrial casupsup uniporter mcu pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac poorly understood show increased mcu expression associated malignancy poorer outcomes patients pdac isogenic murine pdac models mcu deletion mcusupkosup ablated mitochondrial casupsup uptake reduced proliferation inhibited selfrenewal orthotopic implantation mcunull tumor cells reduced primary tumor growth metastasis mcu deletion reduced cellular plasticity tumor cells inhibiting epithelialtomesenchymal transition emt contributes metastatic competency pdac mechanistically loss mitochondrial casupsup uptake reduced expression key emt transcription factor snail secretion emtinducing ligand tgf snail reexpression tgf treatment rescued deficits mcusupkosup cells restored metastatic ability thus mcu may present therapeutic target pdac limit cancercellinduced emt metastasis,Cancer Metabolism
"The histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase KMT2D (also called MLL4) is one of the most frequently mutated epigenetic modifiers in many cancers, including medulloblastoma (MB). Notably, heterozygous KMT2D loss frequently occurs in MB and other cancers. However, its oncogenic role remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that heterozygous Kmt2d loss in murine cerebellar regions promotes MB genesis driven by heterozygous loss of the MB-suppressor gene Ptch via the upregulation of tumor-promoting programs (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]). Downregulation of the transcription-repressive tumor suppressor NCOR2 by heterozygous Kmt2d loss, along with Ptch<sup>+/-</sup>-increased MYCN, upregulated tumor-promoting genes. Heterozygous Kmt2d loss substantially diminished enhancer marks (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) and the H3K4me3 signature, including those for Ncor2. Combinatory pharmacological inhibition of the enhancer-decommissioning H3K4 demethylase LSD1 and OXPHOS significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of MB cells bearing heterozygous Kmt2d loss.

"Oleacein (Olea) and Oleocanthal (Oleo) are two phenolic compounds found in olive oil. Cell and animal studies have shown these two compounds can modulate inflammation, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, the study of the pharmacokinetics of these two compounds appears difficult due to their high reactivity with primary amines. Indeed, the presence of primary amines in culture media and biological fluids raises the question as to whether the observed biological effects are attributable to the parent compounds or to their amine derivatives. In the present work, we investigated the adduct formation between Olea or Oleo and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), a well-known primary amine used primarily as a buffer system, showing that the reaction kinetics were extremely rapid. In addition, we assessed whether the newly formed Tris adducts, i.e., Olea-Tris and Oleo-Tris, retained their antioxidant capacity by means of the ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging assays, showing that their activity was partially maintained. Finally, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of these adducts on murine BV-2 microglial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and kept in an amine-free culture medium, showing how the biological response varied as the compound was degraded. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the biological effects reported in the literature are mainly due to the amino-derivatives of Olea and Oleo rather than the polyphenols derived from their breakdown (tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol).",Cancer Metabolism,oleacein olea oleocanthal oleo two phenolic compounds found olive oil cell animal studies shown two compounds modulate inflammation cancer neurodegenerative diseases unfortunately study pharmacokinetics two compounds appears difficult due high reactivity primary amines indeed presence primary amines culture media biological fluids raises question whether observed biological effects attributable parent compounds amine derivatives present work investigated adduct formation olea oleo trishydroxymethylaminomethane tris wellknown primary amine used primarily buffer system showing reaction kinetics extremely rapid addition assessed whether newly formed tris adducts ie oleatris oleotris retained antioxidant capacity means abts dpph radical scavenging assays showing activity partially maintained finally evaluated antiinflammatory activity adducts murine bv microglial cells stimulated lipopolysaccharide lps kept aminefree culture medium showing biological response varied compound degraded taken together data demonstrate biological effects reported literature mainly due aminoderivatives olea oleo rather polyphenols derived breakdown tyrosol hydroxytyrosol,Cancer Metabolism
"Current breast cancer therapies are unable to positively impact the lives of a significant proportion of diagnosed patients (24% based on 10-year survival rate). Breast cancer relapse and metastasis, the leading cause of breast cancer-associated deaths, is linked to the existence of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). Redox-modulating metal complexes have been used to perturb the redox balance in breast CSCs and effect cell death. Here, we sought to expand this promising class of anti-breast CSC agents. Specifically, we report the synthesis, and anti-breast CSC properties of a series of copper(II) complexes bearing regioisomeric vanillin Schiff base ligands (<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>). X-ray crystallography studies show that the copper(II) complexes <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> adopt square planar geometries with the copper(II) centre coordinated to two vanillin Schiff base ligands. The most effective copper(II) complex within the series <b>4</b> displays low micromolar potency towards breast CSCs, up to 4.6-fold higher than salinomycin and cisplatin. Mechanistic studies indicate that copper(II) complex <b>4</b> elevates reactive oxygen species levels in breast CSCs, leading to activation of the JNK/p38 pathway and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Overall, this work expands the library of anti-breast CSC copper(II) complexes and provides insight into their mode of action.",Cancer Metabolism,current breast cancer therapies unable positively impact lives significant proportion diagnosed patients based year survival rate breast cancer relapse metastasis leading cause breast cancerassociated deaths linked existence breast cancer stem cells cscs redoxmodulating metal complexes used perturb redox balance breast cscs effect cell death sought expand promising class antibreast csc agents specifically report synthesis antibreast csc properties series copperii complexes bearing regioisomeric vanillin schiff base ligands bbbb xray crystallography studies show copperii complexes bbbb adopt square planar geometries copperii centre coordinated two vanillin schiff base ligands effective copperii complex within series bb displays low micromolar potency towards breast cscs fold higher salinomycin cisplatin mechanistic studies indicate copperii complex bb elevates reactive oxygen species levels breast cscs leading activation jnkp pathway caspasedependent apoptosis overall work expands library antibreast csc copperii complexes provides insight mode action,Cancer Metabolism
"Ultrasound (US)-based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) presents a promising and secure approach to treating cancer with the advantage of enhanced tissue penetration, making it a favorable option compared with traditional photodynamic therapy. However, the search for innovative sonosensitizers that exhibit both high sonosensitizing efficacy and good biocompatibility poses a formidable challenge. In this research, we prepared a novel BODIPY-Zn complex (<b>BSS-Zn</b>) incorporating a hydrophilic short polyethylene glycol unit and explored its feasibility as a sonosensitizer. <b>BSS-Zn</b> exhibited enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation behavior upon US irradiation, outperforming a control sensitizer, <b>BSS</b> (an analog lacking the Zn complex), and a commercial sonosensitizer, ZnPc (currently undergoing clinical testing), with regard to sonosensitizing properties. The enhanced effect of <b>BSS-Zn</b> was attributed to increased levels of ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and superoxide, mediated by US exposure in aqueous media. The SDT effect of <b>BSS-Zn</b> on MDA-MB-231 cells was verified by confirming the intracellular types of generated ROS and evaluating the cytotoxicity to MDA-MB-231 cancer cells.

"Cancer is a global health challenge, and its development is closely linked to iron metabolism. Cancer cells have an increased demand for this element, which promotes their proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Excess iron catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can both induce ferroptosis and initiate oncogenic signaling pathways. The deregulation of iron metabolism in cancer patients leads to anemia or toxic iron overload and also affects the gut microbiota. Lactoferrin (LF), a glycoprotein with strong iron chelating properties, can regulate its availability to cancer cells, thereby limiting their growth and progression. By chelating free Fe ions, LF reduces oxidative stress and inhibits the mechanisms that promote carcinogenesis. Additionally, it exhibits immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and may enhance the body's anti-tumor response. This review analyses the mechanisms of action of lactoferrin in the context of cancer, with a particular focus on its chelating, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. The multidirectional effects of LF make it a promising component of preventive and therapeutic strategies, requiring further clinical studies.",Cancer Metabolism,cancer global health challenge development closely linked iron metabolism cancer cells increased demand element promotes proliferation invasion metastasis excess iron catalyzes formation reactive oxygen species ros induce ferroptosis initiate oncogenic signaling pathways deregulation iron metabolism cancer patients leads anemia toxic iron overload also affects gut microbiota lactoferrin lf glycoprotein strong iron chelating properties regulate availability cancer cells thereby limiting growth progression chelating free fe ions lf reduces oxidative stress inhibits mechanisms promote carcinogenesis additionally exhibits immunomodulatory antiinflammatory effects may enhance bodys antitumor response review analyses mechanisms action lactoferrin context cancer particular focus chelating antioxidant immunomodulatory properties multidirectional effects lf make promising component preventive therapeutic strategies requiring clinical studies,Cancer Metabolism
"This study investigates the synthesis, characterization, and cytotoxicity of dinuclear palladium(II) complexes with glycine (Pd1), alanine (Pd2), and methionine (Pd3) as ligands. UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to investigate the complexes' interactions with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) and bovine serum albumin. The obtained measurements demonstrate that Pd1 and Pd2 have stronger binding affinities for CT-DNA compared to Pd3, with Pd3 exhibiting the most significant cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line. The binding behavior was quantified by calculating intrinsic binding constants (K<sub>b</sub>) and Stern-Volmer constants (K<sub>sv</sub>), showing that Pd1 and Pd2 interact more effectively with DNA, possibly due to less steric hindrance in their chelation. Cytotoxic activity was evaluated using an MTT assay, and the results confirm that Pd3, with methionine as the ligand, exhibited superior antitumor effects, inducing apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. The complexes also showed a strong affinity for BSA, indicating their potential for biological interaction. These discoveries shed light on the processes of palladium(II) complexes in biological systems, highlighting their DNA and protein-binding capabilities, as well as their anticancer potential.

"Neuropilin-1 is henceforth a relevant target in cancer treatment; however, its way of action remains partly elusive, and the development of small inhibitory molecules is therefore required for its study. Here, we report that two small-sized neuropilin antagonists (NRPa-47 and NRPa-48), VEGF-A<sub>165</sub>/NRP-1 binding inhibitors, are able to decrease VEGF-Rs phosphorylation and to modulate their downstream cascades in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). Nevertheless, NRPas exert a divergent pathway regulation of MAPK phosphorylation, such as JNK-1/-2/-3, ERK-1/-2, and p38β/γ/δ-kinases, as well as their respective downstream targets. However, NRPa-47 and NRPa-48 apply a common down-regulation of the p38α-kinase phosphorylation and their downstream targets, emphasising its central regulating role. More importantly, none of the 40 selected kinases, including SAPK2a/p38α, are affected in vitro by NRPas, strengthening their specificity. Taken together, NRPas induced cell death by the down-modulation of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, cell death receptors and adaptors, heat shock proteins (HSP-27/-60/-70), cell cycle proteins (p21, p27, phospho-RAD17), and transcription factors (p53, HIF-1α). In conclusion, we showed for the first time how NRPas may alter tumour cell signalling and contribute to the down-modulation of the cancer therapeutic key factor p38α-kinase phosphorylation. Thus, the efficient association of NRPas and p38α-kinase inhibitor strengthened this hypothesis.",Cancer Metabolism,neuropilin henceforth relevant target cancer treatment however way action remains partly elusive development small inhibitory molecules therefore required study report two smallsized neuropilin antagonists nrpa nrpa vegfasubsubnrp binding inhibitors able decrease vegfrs phosphorylation modulate downstream cascades triplenegative breast cancer cell line mdamb nevertheless nrpas exert divergent pathway regulation mapk phosphorylation jnk erk pkinases well respective downstream targets however nrpa nrpa apply common downregulation pkinase phosphorylation downstream targets emphasising central regulating role importantly none selected kinases including sapkap affected vitro nrpas strengthening specificity taken together nrpas induced cell death downmodulation proapoptotic antiapoptotic proteins cell death receptors adaptors heat shock proteins hsp cell cycle proteins p p phosphorad transcription factors p hif conclusion showed first time nrpas may alter tumour cell signalling contribute downmodulation cancer therapeutic key factor pkinase phosphorylation thus efficient association nrpas pkinase inhibitor strengthened hypothesis,Cancer Metabolism

"Exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor prescribed for post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, is associated with debilitating musculoskeletal side effects and exhibits considerable interindividual variability in systemic exposure. Although exemestane is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P-450 3A4, the contribution of this metabolic pathway to the elimination of exemestane and its drug-drug interaction liabilities remains uncertain. Here, we developed a novel quantification method for exemestane and applied it to evaluate the role of CYP3A-mediated metabolism in the pharmacokinetics of exemestane using wild-type and <i>Cyp3a</i>-deficient mice. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify exemestane in selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, in which precursor ion and fragment ion data were obtained simultaneously. Validation results demonstrated that the developed method was accurate and precise, and sufficiently sensitive to be applied to murine pharmacokinetic studies involving serial blood sampling strategies. Although in vitro studies indicate that exemestane undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver to inactive metabolites by CYP3A4, complete <i>Cyp3a</i> deficiency in mice did not influence the systemic exposure to exemestane. This unequivocal evidence from genetic approaches using preclinical mouse models confirms that the potential for such DDI liabilities is very low.

"This review explores the potential role of androgens in human breast cancer and female canine mammary tumors. Human breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women globally, while female canine mammary tumors provide a natural model for the study of human breast cancer due to their similar histopathologies and molecular features. Androgen receptors, typically linked to male sex hormones, are present in up to 90% of human breast tumors. These receptors interact with estrogen-receptor signaling, suggesting their involvement in a complex mechanism in cancer progression. Androgen receptors have become key players in breast cancer biology, offering new targets for therapeutic strategies. The presence of these receptors in both human and canine tumors raises important questions about their role in the development of these malignancies. While the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, research suggests that targeting androgen-receptor signaling could be a novel therapeutic approach for both humans and canines. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the implications of androgen-receptor expression and to develop more effective targeted therapies for these cancers.",Cancer Metabolism,review explores potential role androgens human breast cancer female canine mammary tumors human breast cancer one common cancers affecting women globally female canine mammary tumors provide natural model study human breast cancer due similar histopathologies molecular features androgen receptors typically linked male sex hormones present human breast tumors receptors interact estrogenreceptor signaling suggesting involvement complex mechanism cancer progression androgen receptors become key players breast cancer biology offering new targets therapeutic strategies presence receptors human canine tumors raises important questions role development malignancies exact mechanisms remain fully elucidated research suggests targeting androgenreceptor signaling could novel therapeutic approach humans canines studies necessary fully understand implications androgenreceptor expression develop effective targeted therapies cancers,Cancer Metabolism

"Nineteen potential mimics of 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (8,9-EET), a natural bioactive oxylipin, were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to protect renal mesangial cells against sorafenib-induced cell death in a water-soluble tetrazolium (WST-8) assay. All compounds were also evaluated as inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase. As expected of a potent pan-kinase inhibitor the drug sorafenib caused a significant decrease in cell viability in HRMCs. Several analogs containing amide and oxamide groups in place of the epoxide showed efficacy in reducing sorafenib induced human renal mesangial cell (HRMC) death. Oxamide containing analogs proved particularly effective, with the most promising analog increasing cell viability five-fold over control at 1 µM. These analogs, containing an oxamide group as a bioisostere for the epoxide in 8,9-EET, did not display significant inhibitory activity towards soluble epoxide hydrolase. This preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis reveals the oxamide group as a promising bioisostere for the epoxide in the 8,9-position of the fatty acid chain, producing protective effects against sorafenib-induced cell death in HRMCs.

"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) are considered to be one of the most effective methods for treating cancer due to their noninvasive nature, high effectiveness, and fewer side effects compared to standard therapeutic modalities for cancer. However, conventional always-on types of PDT and PTT agents have basic drawbacks in their in vivo applications, which include the unwanted generation of strong fluorescence signals and phototoxicity in normal tissues, including blood vessels, when exposed to light, resulting in poor imaging contrast and unwanted phototoxicity. Here, we propose indocyanine green-loaded quenched nanoliposomes (Q-ICG-NLs) as an activatable nanotheranostics. Q-ICG-NLs showed significant quenching in near-infrared fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen generation upon light irradiation. The photothermal effect of Q-ICG-NLs was 1.3 times greater than free indocyanine green. Its fluorescence and singlet oxygen generation were largely restored when taken up into cancer cells, enabling the selective detection and phototherapy of cancer cells. These results suggest that Q-ICG-NLs can be effectively used for selective near-infrared fluorescence imaging and the subsequent image-guided PDT and PTT of cancers.",Cancer Metabolism,photodynamic therapy pdt photothermal therapy ptt considered one effective methods treating cancer due noninvasive nature high effectiveness fewer side effects compared standard therapeutic modalities cancer however conventional alwayson types pdt ptt agents basic drawbacks vivo applications include unwanted generation strong fluorescence signals phototoxicity normal tissues including blood vessels exposed light resulting poor imaging contrast unwanted phototoxicity propose indocyanine greenloaded quenched nanoliposomes qicgnls activatable nanotheranostics qicgnls showed significant quenching nearinfrared fluorescence emission singlet oxygen generation upon light irradiation photothermal effect qicgnls times greater free indocyanine green fluorescence singlet oxygen generation largely restored taken cancer cells enabling selective detection phototherapy cancer cells results suggest qicgnls effectively used selective nearinfrared fluorescence imaging subsequent imageguided pdt ptt cancers,Cancer Metabolism
"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy, and perineural invasion (PNI) is a common pathological feature that significantly contributes to poor prognosis. Our research identified TGFBI as a key player in PNI development. The expression of TGFBI in tissue and cancer cells were detected by RT-qPCR, Western blot, Immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. The localization of TGFBI in cells was analyzed by Immunofluorescence staining (IF). The neural invasion ability of cancer cells were assessed by in vitro neural invasion model. Moreover, Western blot was used to investigate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and PI3K/AKT pathway markers to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Finally, an in vivo neural invasion model was used to verify the tumorigenic ability of the cancer cells in the sciatic nerve. Our findings highlight that TGFBI is up-regulated in PNI tissue and significantly correlates with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Based on in vitro experiments, knockdown of TGFBI reduced neural invasion, as well as EMT, whereas rTGFBI exhibited the reverse effect. Knockdown of TGFBI reduced PI3K/AKT phosphorylation in Capan-2 and CFPAC-1. Moreover, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was observed to counteract the effects of TGFBI on neural invasion, and EMT in Capan-2 and CFPAC-1.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most prevalent form of dementia, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and chronic neuroinflammation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 and anti-PD-L1, signify a revolutionary advancement in cancer treatment by preventing T-cell exhaustion; however, their therapeutic application in AD presents a conundrum. Hypothesis: Recent preclinical studies indicate that PD-1 inhibition in AD mouse models induces an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-mediated response, leading to increased recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain, enhanced clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and improved cognitive performance. Nonetheless, this therapeutic effect is counterbalanced by the potential for exacerbated neuroinflammation, as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may potentiate pro-inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 responses. In this review, we critically discuss the pertinent pro-inflammatory and neuroprotective facets of T cell biology in the pathogenesis of AD, emphasizing the potential for modulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis to influence both Aβ clearance and the dynamics of neuroinflammatory processes. In summary, we determine that ICIs are promising tools for reducing AD pathology and improving cognition. However, it is essential to refine treatment protocols and carefully select patients to optimize neuroprotective effects while adequately considering inflammatory risks.",Cancer Metabolism,alzheimers disease ad represents prevalent form dementia characterized progressive cognitive impairment chronic neuroinflammation immune checkpoint inhibitors icis including antiprogrammed cell death pd antipdl signify revolutionary advancement cancer treatment preventing tcell exhaustion however therapeutic application ad presents conundrum hypothesis recent preclinical studies indicate pd inhibition ad mouse models induces interferongamma ifnmediated response leading increased recruitment monocytederived macrophages brain enhanced clearance amyloidbeta plaques improved cognitive performance nonetheless therapeutic effect counterbalanced potential exacerbated neuroinflammation pdpdl blockade may potentiate proinflammatory helper th th responses review critically discuss pertinent proinflammatory neuroprotective facets cell biology pathogenesis ad emphasizing potential modulation pdpdl axis influence clearance dynamics neuroinflammatory processes summary determine icis promising tools reducing ad pathology improving cognition however essential refine treatment protocols carefully select patients optimize neuroprotective effects adequately considering inflammatory risks,Cancer Metabolism
"Addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor to endocrine therapy (ET) prolongs survival in HR + /HER2-metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Gastrointestinal side effects, predominantly diarrhoea and abdominal pain, are common in patients receiving abemaciclib. This can potentially increase symptom burden, reduce quality of life (QoL) and affect treatment adherence. This longitudinal mixed-methods study with a 6-month follow-up explored patients' outcomes and experiences. Participants (n = 44) completed validated QoL measures at study-entry and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Weekly diarrhoea diaries with free-text response options assessed bowel movements and self-management strategies. Optional interviews gathered insight in patients' experiences. Forty-two participants completed study measures at study-entry and 24 at 6 months. 17/42 reported no gastrointestinal side-effects. Above threshold diarrhoea (≥ 3 loose/liquid stools daily) was reported at least once by 25/42, with 3/42 having persistent symptoms. Strategies to control diarrhoea, employed by 28/42, included dietary modifications, non-prescribed medication-use and nonadherence (dose interruption or reduction). Meaningful decline on the QoL diarrhoea subscale was observed in 12/37 at 1 month, 13/28 at 3 months and 8/23 at 6 months. Free-text analysis showed that diarrhoea disrupted everyday life in those affected. A proportion of this small sample of MBC patients treated with abemaciclib and ET-reported diarrhoea which affected symptom burden and QoL.

"Lung cancer remains the most prevalent carcinoma with a high mortality rate, yet the underlying mechanisms driving pulmonary neoplasia and disease progression are not fully understood. In our study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome profiles and clinicopathological characteristics of 515 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the TCGA database. We identified a significant upregulation of centromere protein M (CENPM) in NSCLC tissues, which was positively correlated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, overexpression of CENPM markedly promoted cell proliferation and increased the tumorigenic potential of NSCLC cell lines (A549/NCI-H1299), leading to accelerated tumor progression and reduced survival time in tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CENPM activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway via the cell division cycle 20 (CDC20)/MYB proto-oncogene-like 2 (MYBL2) axis. Inhibition of either Wnt signaling or the CDC20/MYBL2 axis attenuated the tumorigenic potential and proliferative effects induced by CENPM. Our findings underscore the critical role of CENPM in driving NSCLC development and suggest that CENPM could serve as a novel biomarker for predicting NSCLC progression in clinical settings.",Cancer Metabolism,lung cancer remains prevalent carcinoma high mortality rate yet underlying mechanisms driving pulmonary neoplasia disease progression fully understood study conducted comprehensive analysis transcriptome profiles clinicopathological characteristics patients diagnosed nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc tcga database identified significant upregulation centromere protein cenpm nsclc tissues positively correlated poor prognosis furthermore overexpression cenpm markedly promoted cell proliferation increased tumorigenic potential nsclc cell lines ancih leading accelerated tumor progression reduced survival time tumorbearing mice mechanistically cenpm activated wntcatenin signaling pathway via cell division cycle cdcmyb protooncogenelike mybl axis inhibition either wnt signaling cdcmybl axis attenuated tumorigenic potential proliferative effects induced cenpm findings underscore critical role cenpm driving nsclc development suggest cenpm could serve novel biomarker predicting nsclc progression clinical settings,Cancer Metabolism
"The IMPACTOR study (IMPact of AbemaCiclib on patienTs' rOles and Responsibilities-ISRCTN17281696) was developed to capture experiences of women with MBC being treated with abemaciclib in a real-world setting. The primary aim was to explore changes to quality of life over time and our secondary aim was to understand these changes in detail via qualitative interviews, as presented here. A singular interview was offered to participants who had expressed an interest at the point of consent. These were all conducted remotely using a semi-structured interview topic guide. Twenty interviews were completed and analysed using a framework approach to thematic analysis. Eight themes were developed-COVID-19, experience of MBC, side effects, side effect management, treatment information and support, relationship impacts, impact on daily life, and finances and employment. It was apparent that participants faced side effects from treatment but undertook steps to manage these as much as possible. Adaptations were often led by a belief about the benefits of remaining on treatment. Adjustments ranged from modifying routines to carrying personal hygiene supplies when out in public in case of diarrhoea. While this was anticipated, other side effects were less well known with variable clinical support and available information. Family support was raised frequently, predominantly in relation to the impact MBC had on roles and relationships. Themes from this work can be thought of via theories about treatment belief and adherence, such as the common-sense and self-regulation models, as participants reflected on both emotional and cognitive coping strategies.

"Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), considered as the linkage between tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and electron transport chain, plays a vital role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and cell physiology. SDH deficiency is a notable characteristic in many cancers. Recent studies have pinpointed the dysregulation of SDH can directly result its decreased catalytic activity and the accumulation of oncometabolite succinate, promoting tumor progression in different perspectives. This article expounds the various types of SDH deficiency in tumors and the corresponding pathological features. In addition, we discuss the mechanisms through which defective SDH fosters carcinogenesis, pioneering a categorization of these mechanisms as being either succinate-dependent or independent. Since SDH-deficient and cumulative succinate are regarded as the typical features of some cancers, like gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, we summarize the presented medical management of SDH-deficient tumor patients in clinical and preclinical, identifying the potential strategies for future cancer therapeutics.",Cancer Metabolism,succinate dehydrogenase sdh considered linkage tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle electron transport chain plays vital role adenosine triphosphate atp production cell physiology sdh deficiency notable characteristic many cancers recent studies pinpointed dysregulation sdh directly result decreased catalytic activity accumulation oncometabolite succinate promoting tumor progression different perspectives article expounds various types sdh deficiency tumors corresponding pathological features addition discuss mechanisms defective sdh fosters carcinogenesis pioneering categorization mechanisms either succinatedependent independent since sdhdeficient cumulative succinate regarded typical features cancers like gastrointestinal stromal tumors pheochromocytomas paragangliomas summarize presented medical management sdhdeficient tumor patients clinical preclinical identifying potential strategies future cancer therapeutics,Cancer Metabolism
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and activated T cells rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. The TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits glycolysis and protects AML cells from apoptosis. Preliminary studies suggest that combining TIGAR inhibition with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) may offer a therapeutic strategy for AML. However, it remains unclear whether silencing TIGAR can enhance T cell function and thereby improve AML prognosis. This study aims to investigate whether TIGAR silencing in host can eliminate AML cells and rejuvenate dysfunctional T cells with mouse models. TIGAR knockout mice on the C57BL/6J background were generated and AML mouse models were established through intravenous injection of C1498 cells. We found that TIGAR depletion enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and raised CD4/CD8 ratio, downregulating CD44 and immune checkpoints CTLA-4, LAG-3, PD-1 on cell surface of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. TIGAR depletion boosted cytokine secretion (IFN-γ, perforin, granzyme B, TNF-α) by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-2, TNF-α by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, improving cytotoxicity against AML cells, proliferation, and reducing apoptosis. TIGAR suppression in host with 2-DG prolonged AML mouse survival, decreased tumor burden, and leukemic infiltration. TIGAR suppression restored thymic T cell development and peripheral immune balance. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis also revealed that high TIGAR expression influences the glycolysis pathway, and correlates with markers of T cell exhaustion.

"The vulnerability of tumor cells to lipid peroxidation, driven by redox imbalance and lipid overabundance within the tumor microenvironment (TME), has become a focal point for novel antitumor strategies. Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death predicated on lipid peroxidation, is emerging as a promising approach. Beyond their role in directly eliminating tumor cells, lipid peroxidation and its products, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), exert an additional influence by damaging DNA and shaping an environment conducive to tumor growth and metastasis. This process polarizes macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype, dampens the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells (DCs), and undermines the cytotoxic functions of T and NK cells. Furthermore, it transforms neutrophils into pro-tumorigenic polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). The lipid peroxidation of stroma cells also contributes to tumor progression. Although advanced nanotherapies have shown the ability to target tumor cells precisely, they often overlook the nuanced effects of lipid peroxidation products. In this review, we highlight a synergistic mechanism in which lipid peroxidation products and ferroptosis contribute to an immunosuppressive state that is temporally distinct from cell death. This insight broadens our understanding of ferroptosis-derived immunosuppression, encompassing all types of immune cells within the TME. This review aims to catalyze further research in this underexplored area, emphasizing the potential of lipid peroxidation products to hinder the clinical translation of ferroptosis-based therapies.",Cancer Metabolism,vulnerability tumor cells lipid peroxidation driven redox imbalance lipid overabundance within tumor microenvironment tme become focal point novel antitumor strategies ferroptosis form regulated cell death predicated lipid peroxidation emerging promising approach beyond role directly eliminating tumor cells lipid peroxidation products hydroxynonenal hne exert additional influence damaging dna shaping environment conducive tumor growth metastasis process polarizes macrophages towards proinflammatory phenotype dampens antigenpresenting capacity dendritic cells dcs undermines cytotoxic functions nk cells furthermore transforms neutrophils protumorigenic polymorphonuclear myeloidderived suppressor cells pmnmdscs lipid peroxidation stroma cells also contributes tumor progression although advanced nanotherapies shown ability target tumor cells precisely often overlook nuanced effects lipid peroxidation products review highlight synergistic mechanism lipid peroxidation products ferroptosis contribute immunosuppressive state temporally distinct cell death insight broadens understanding ferroptosisderived immunosuppression encompassing types immune cells within tme review aims catalyze research underexplored area emphasizing potential lipid peroxidation products hinder clinical translation ferroptosisbased therapies,Cancer Metabolism
"The inhibitory effects of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antibody infliximab (IFX) on colitis are well established. Since IFX dosing is weight-based and associated with various side effects, there is a growing interest in identifying combination therapies that can enhance its efficacy, particularly in overweight inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, to maximize the anti-inflammatory effect while minimizing the required dose. Our research revealed that overweight IBD patients present decreased vitamin D levels in the intestinal epithelium alongside elevated TNF-α levels. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for four weeks, treatment with the vitamin D analog palicalcitol (PAL) reduced lipid synthesis and TNF-α production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitis model, PAL treatment mitigated TNF-α-induced damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier and reduced the activation of Th1 and Th17 cells in the lamina propria, thereby reducing colitis development in HFD-fed mice. Notably, the combination of IFX and PAL was more effective than IFX alone in treating colitis in these mice. Overall, our findings suggest that vitamin D inhibits TNF-α production by reducing lipid synthesis in IECs, thereby enhancing IFX therapy in overweight IBD patients.",Cancer Metabolism,inhibitory effects tumor necrosis factor tnf antibody infliximab ifx colitis well established since ifx dosing weightbased associated various side effects growing interest identifying combination therapies enhance efficacy particularly overweight inflammatory bowel disease ibd patients maximize antiinflammatory effect minimizing required dose research revealed overweight ibd patients present decreased vitamin levels intestinal epithelium alongside elevated tnf levels mice fed highfat diet hfd four weeks treatment vitamin analog palicalcitol pal reduced lipid synthesis tnf production intestinal epithelial cells iecs trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid tnbsinduced experimental colitis model pal treatment mitigated tnfinduced damage intestinal epithelial barrier reduced activation th th cells lamina propria thereby reducing colitis development hfdfed mice notably combination ifx pal effective ifx alone treating colitis mice overall findings suggest vitamin inhibits tnf production reducing lipid synthesis iecs thereby enhancing ifx therapy overweight ibd patients,Cancer Metabolism
"To evaluate the diagnostic yield of thyroid CT in patients with post-treatment differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) stratified by treatment response. This retrospective study included DTC patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation, followed by thyroid CT. Patients were categorized into response assessment groups according to the American Thyroid Association guidelines: excellent response (ER), biochemical incomplete response (BIR), indeterminate response (IR), and structural incomplete response (SIR). Diagnostic yield was defined as the proportion of patients with recurrent tumors among all patients. The yields of ER, BIR, and IR were compared. For IR, subgroup analyses were performed based on the presence of indeterminate lesions on ultrasound (US). Chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction were used to compare the diagnostic yields between groups. A total of 450 patients (mean age, 44.9 ± 13.4 years; 164 men) were included. The overall diagnostic yield of thyroid CT was 15.3% (69/450; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.3-19%). Yields for the ER, BIR, and IR groups were 2% (4/201; 95% CI: 0.6-5.2%), 23.1% (12/52; 95% CI: 13.6-36.3%), and 26.9% (53/197; 95% CI: 21.2-33.5%), respectively. Among IR patients, the yield was significantly lower in US-negative patients (7.5%, 7/93; 95% CI: 3.5-15%) compared to those with indeterminate US lesions (44.2%, 46/104; 95% CI: 35.1-53.8%) (p < 0.001).

"Recent studies have revealed the critical role of exosomes in cancer progression, particularly aggressive breast cancers. These findings underscore the requirement for further investigation into the mechanisms of exosome-mediated cancer and emphasize the urgency and critical nature of such studies. In the present study, exosomes of MDA-MB-231 cells were isolated from serum-free media using differential ultracentrifugation. Size distribution was assessed using dynamic light scattering, and exosome morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy. Flow cytometry analysis showed considerable expression of the metastatic markers CD105 and CD133, although cancer cells exhibited low expression of these markers. Exosomes were labeled with Aco-490 and internalized by MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. The results indicated that post-sorting, CD133-positive exosomes considerably increased the phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, although they did not have a notable influence on cyclin D1 levels.

"There is a progressive decline in physiological function with age, and aging is associated with increased susceptibility to injury and infection. However, several reports have indicated that the agility of youth is characterized by transferable rejuvenating molecular factors, as was observed previously in heterochronic parabiosis experiments. These experiments demonstrated a rejuvenating effect of young blood in old animals. There have been several efforts to characterize these youthful or maturation-associated factors in the young blood. In this report, we demonstrate the resilience of young mice, at or before puberty, to polymicrobial sepsis and show an age-dependent effect of small extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma on the outcome following sepsis. The EVs from the young mice were cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and reduced cellular senescence markers. MicroRNA sequencing of the EVs showed an age-associated signature and identified miR-296-5p and miR-541-5p to progressively reduce their levels in the blood plasma with increasing age. We further show that the levels of these miRNAs decline with age in multiple organs. The miRNAs miR-296-5p and miR-541-5p showed a reparatory effect in an in vitro wound healing model and the miR-296-5p, when given intraperitoneally, reduced mortality in the mouse model of sepsis. In summary, our studies demonstrate that EVs from very young mice have a reparative effect on sepsis, and the reparative factors are likely maturation-dependent. Our observation that miR-296-5p and miR-541-5p are plasma EV constituents that significantly reduce with age and can reduce inflammation suggests a therapeutic potential for these miRNAs in inflammation and age-associated diseases.",Cancer Metabolism,progressive decline physiological function age aging associated increased susceptibility injury infection however several reports indicated agility youth characterized transferable rejuvenating molecular factors observed previously heterochronic parabiosis experiments experiments demonstrated rejuvenating effect young blood old animals several efforts characterize youthful maturationassociated factors young blood report demonstrate resilience young mice puberty polymicrobial sepsis show agedependent effect small extracellular vesicles evs plasma outcome following sepsis evs young mice cytoprotective antiinflammatory reduced cellular senescence markers microrna sequencing evs showed ageassociated signature identified mirp mirp progressively reduce levels blood plasma increasing age show levels mirnas decline age multiple organs mirnas mirp mirp showed reparatory effect vitro wound healing model mirp given intraperitoneally reduced mortality mouse model sepsis summary studies demonstrate evs young mice reparative effect sepsis reparative factors likely maturationdependent observation mirp mirp plasma ev constituents significantly reduce age reduce inflammation suggests therapeutic potential mirnas inflammation ageassociated diseases,Cancer Metabolism
"FET proteins are large multifunctional proteins that have several key roles in biology. The FET family of proteins, including FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15, play critical roles in transcription regulation, RNA processing, and DNA damage repair. These multifunctional RNA- and DNA-binding proteins are ubiquitously expressed and conserved across vertebrate species. They contain low-complexity (LC) domains that allow them to assemble and phase separate but also makes the proteins prone to aggregation. Aberrations in FET proteins, such as point mutations, aggregation, or translocations leading to fusion proteins, have been implicated in several pathologies, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Ewing sarcoma. In vitro study of FET proteins is hampered by their propensity to aggregate, their disordered structure, and their susceptibility to proteolysis, making high-yield production difficult. Here, we present optimized methods for the purification of full-length FUS, EWSR1, and their fusion proteins.

"Despite numerous studies focusing on the folding mechanism of globular proteins as well as ligand-induced folding of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), a unified framework for understanding both types of folding mechanisms has remained elusive. To explore the similarities and differences in the structural dynamics of spontaneous versus ligand-dependent folding, we investigated the folding dynamics of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in the presence and absence of the substrate analog adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate (prAp). We employed equilibrium and kinetic measurements, using fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, to study the folding of SNase coupled with the binding of prAp as a function of ligand and urea concentrations, including conditions favoring either conformational selection (CS; folding before binding) or induced fit (IF; binding before folding) scenarios. Our findings revealed that during ligand-induced folding under IF conditions, the N-terminal β-barrel domain is formed first, followed by the α-helical domain. In contrast, under CS conditions, the α-helical domain forms before the β-barrel domain. Additionally, the dynamics of ligand-induced folding mirrors the sequence of events encountered along the minor of the two parallel pathways governing the spontaneous folding process. Therefore, some of the apparent mechanistic differences between spontaneous versus ligand-induced folding can be attributed to the fact that interactions with a nucleotide ligand result in a shift in flux from the major to the minor folding pathway.",Cancer Metabolism,despite numerous studies focusing folding mechanism globular proteins well ligandinduced folding intrinsically disordered proteins idps unified framework understanding types folding mechanisms remained elusive explore similarities differences structural dynamics spontaneous versus liganddependent folding investigated folding dynamics staphylococcal nuclease snase presence absence substrate analog adenosine diphosphate prap employed equilibrium kinetic measurements using fluorescence nmr spectroscopy study folding snase coupled binding prap function ligand urea concentrations including conditions favoring either conformational selection cs folding binding induced fit binding folding scenarios findings revealed ligandinduced folding conditions nterminal barrel domain formed first followed helical domain contrast cs conditions helical domain forms barrel domain additionally dynamics ligandinduced folding mirrors sequence events encountered along minor two parallel pathways governing spontaneous folding process therefore apparent mechanistic differences spontaneous versus ligandinduced folding attributed fact interactions nucleotide ligand result shift flux major minor folding pathway,Cancer Metabolism

"Chemoresistance poses a significant clinical challenge in managing glioblastoma (GBM), limiting the long-term success of traditional treatments. Here, a 3D tumoroid model is used to investigate the metabolic sensitivity of temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM cells to iron chelation by deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP). This work shows that TMZ-resistant GBM cells acquire stem-like characteristics, higher intracellular iron levels, higher expression of aconitase, and elevated reliance on oxidative phosphorylation and proteins associated with iron metabolism. Using a microphysiological model of GBM-on-a-chip consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM)-incorporated tumoroids, this work demonstrates that the combination of iron chelators with TMZ induces a synergistic effect on an in vitro tumoroid model of newly diagnosed and recurrent chemo-resistant patient-derived GBM and reduced their size and invasion. Investigating downstream metabolic variations reveal reduced intracellular iron, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, reduced viability, increased autophagy, upregulated ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2), arrested proliferation, and induced cell death in normoxic TMZ-resistant cells.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is driven by complex metabolic alterations, including aberrant N-glycosylation patterns that critically influence tumor development. However, the metabolic and functional roles of N-glycosylation in CRC remain poorly understood. Herein, comprehensive proteomic and N-linked intact glycoproteomics analyses are performed on 45 CRC tumors, and normal adjacent tissues (NATs) are matched, identifying 7125 intact N-glycopeptides from 704 glycoproteins. Through analysis of glycoform expression profiles and structural characteristics, a glycosylation site-protein function association network is constructed to uncover metabolic dysregulation driven by N-glycosylation in CRC. Moreover, an arithmetic model is developed that integrates N-glycan expression patterns, which effectively distinguishes tumors from NATs, reflecting metabolic reprogramming in cancer. These findings identify Chloride Channel Accessory 1 (CLCA1) and Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) as potential metabolic biomarkers for CRC diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry and Cox regression analyses validated the prognostic power of these markers. Notably, the critical role of specific N-glycosylation at N196 of Adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) is highlighted, a key player in tumor metabolism and CRC progression, providing a potential target for therapeutic intervention. These findings offer valuable insights into the metabolic roles of N-glycosylation in CRC, advancing biomarker discovery, enhancing metabolic-based diagnostic precision, and improving personalized treatment strategies targeting cancer metabolism.",Cancer Metabolism,colorectal cancer crc progression driven complex metabolic alterations including aberrant nglycosylation patterns critically influence tumor development however metabolic functional roles nglycosylation crc remain poorly understood herein comprehensive proteomic nlinked intact glycoproteomics analyses performed crc tumors normal adjacent tissues nats matched identifying intact nglycopeptides glycoproteins analysis glycoform expression profiles structural characteristics glycosylation siteprotein function association network constructed uncover metabolic dysregulation driven nglycosylation crc moreover arithmetic model developed integrates nglycan expression patterns effectively distinguishes tumors nats reflecting metabolic reprogramming cancer findings identify chloride channel accessory clca olfactomedin olfm potential metabolic biomarkers crc diagnosis immunohistochemistry cox regression analyses validated prognostic power markers notably critical role specific nglycosylation n adipocyte plasma membraneassociated protein apmap highlighted key player tumor metabolism crc progression providing potential target therapeutic intervention findings offer valuable insights metabolic roles nglycosylation crc advancing biomarker discovery enhancing metabolicbased diagnostic precision improving personalized treatment strategies targeting cancer metabolism,Cancer Metabolism
"Prostate cancer frequently progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) following androgen deprivation therapy, presenting a significant clinical challenge. Targeting tumor metabolism, particularly mitochondrial pathways, offers a promising strategy for overcoming CRPC. The modification of melatonin (Mel) to a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation-targeted mitochondria-melatonin (Mito-Mel) significantly increases its potency by over 1000-fold. Mito-Mel selectively targets mitochondria, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and causing mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. This leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which, in turn, suppresses CRPC survival metabolic adaptations, such as glycolysis. In vitro and in vivo experiments reveal for the first time that natural small molecule compound with mitochondrial targeting via TPP exhibits excellent anticancer efficacy by inducing tumor cellular pyroptosis and facilitating the immune response, underlining the encouraging promise of this strategy for the effective treatment of CRPC.",Cancer Metabolism,prostate cancer frequently progresses castrationresistant prostate cancer crpc following androgen deprivation therapy presenting significant clinical challenge targeting tumor metabolism particularly mitochondrial pathways offers promising strategy overcoming crpc modification melatonin mel triphenylphosphonium tpp cationtargeted mitochondriamelatonin mitomel significantly increases potency fold mitomel selectively targets mitochondria enhancing reactive oxygen species ros generation causing mitochondrial membrane potential disruption leads inhibition mitochondrial respiration including tricarboxylic acid tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation oxphos turn suppresses crpc survival metabolic adaptations glycolysis vitro vivo experiments reveal first time natural small molecule compound mitochondrial targeting via tpp exhibits excellent anticancer efficacy inducing tumor cellular pyroptosis facilitating immune response underlining encouraging promise strategy effective treatment crpc,Cancer Metabolism
"Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a derivative of artemisinin, which affects inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune regulation. However, the mechanism underlying its effects remains largely unknown. This study aims to explore the mechanism by which DHA affects radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), providing new insights for lung radiotherapy. To elucidate its mechanism of action, C57BL/6 J mice were irradiated with 15 Gy whole chest. RILI was evaluated by qRT-PCR, ELISA, histology, Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and RILI signaling cascade studies. In addition, small interfering RNAs were employed to knockdown cGAS proteins in the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the human bronchial epithelium cell line (BEAS-2B). Both In Vivo and Vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the specific mechanism by which DHA alleviated RILI. We observed the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, along with the phosphorylation of the downstream target NF-κB and an increase in inflammatory factor levels in the mouse model following radiation exposure. In the cell model, irradiation also triggered the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and its downstream targets, leading to elevated levels of inflammatory factors. Notably, knocking down the cGAS using small interfering RNA in the BEAS-2B cells significantly alleviated RILI in the cell model. Our study elucidated the mechanism of DHA reducing RILI through the cGAS/STING/NF-κB signaling pathway, and revealed that the GAS/STING/NF-κB axis may be a potential therapeutic target for RILI.",Cancer Metabolism,dihydroartemisinin dha derivative artemisinin affects inflammation oxidative stress immune regulation however mechanism underlying effects remains largely unknown study aims explore mechanism dha affects radiationinduced lung injury rili providing new insights lung radiotherapy elucidate mechanism action cbl j mice irradiated gy whole chest rili evaluated qrtpcr elisa histology western blot analysis immunohistochemistry rili signaling cascade studies addition small interfering rnas employed knockdown cgas proteins cgassting signaling pathway human bronchial epithelium cell line beasb vivo vitro experiments conducted investigate specific mechanism dha alleviated rili observed activation cgassting pathway along phosphorylation downstream target nfb increase inflammatory factor levels mouse model following radiation exposure cell model irradiation also triggered activation cgassting signaling pathway downstream targets leading elevated levels inflammatory factors notably knocking cgas using small interfering rna beasb cells significantly alleviated rili cell model study elucidated mechanism dha reducing rili cgasstingnfb signaling pathway revealed gasstingnfb axis may potential therapeutic target rili,Cancer Metabolism
"Oxidative stress plays a role in vascular dysfunction and cardiometabolic health. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training on antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma/FRAP) and hemodynamic measures: systolic blood pressure (∆SBP), diastolic blood pressure (∆DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (∆MAP), large arterial elasticity index (∆LAEI), and small arterial elasticity index (∆SAEI) in a cohort of healthy women. This was a secondary data analysis of a study designed to evaluate cardiometabolic outcomes. Participants performed supervised aerobic exercise 3 times/week on a stationary cycle ergometer. FRAP and hemodynamic measures were measured baseline and post-training. The analysis included 15 African American and 14 Caucasian women aged 32.2 ± 5.5 years. No significant changes were observed for FRAP or hemodynamic measures. However, significant negative correlations between ∆FRAP and ∆SBP, ∆DBP, and MAP, as well as a positive correlation with ∆SAEI and ∆LAEI were observed. ∆SBP, ∆DBP, and ∆MAP were each modeled with three multiple regression models: (1) ∆FRAP, ∆SAEI, and ∆LAEI as independent variables. All models had significant R<sup>2</sup>. ∆FRAP was significantly related to ∆DBP and ∆MAP after adjusting for ∆SAEI and ∆LAEI (partial R -0.38 and -0.32 respectively). ∆SAEI was independently related to ∆SBP (partial -0.32) and ∆MAP (partial -0.34). ∆LAEI was independently related to ∆SBP (partial -0.36) and ∆MAP (partial -0.40). ∆FRAP is significantly associated with lowered blood pressure and elevated arterial elasticity. While multiple regression analysis suggests that at least some of the lowered blood pressure is achieved through processes associated with increased arterial elasticity.",Cancer Metabolism,oxidative stress plays role vascular dysfunction cardiometabolic health purpose study assess effects aerobic exercise training antioxidant capacity ferric reducing ability plasmafrap hemodynamic measures systolic blood pressure sbp diastolic blood pressure dbp mean arterial blood pressure map large arterial elasticity index laei small arterial elasticity index saei cohort healthy women secondary data analysis study designed evaluate cardiometabolic outcomes participants performed supervised aerobic exercise timesweek stationary cycle ergometer frap hemodynamic measures measured baseline posttraining analysis included african american caucasian women aged years significant changes observed frap hemodynamic measures however significant negative correlations frap sbp dbp map well positive correlation saei laei observed sbp dbp map modeled three multiple regression models frap saei laei independent variables models significant rsupsup frap significantly related dbp map adjusting saei laei partial r respectively saei independently related sbp partial map partial laei independently related sbp partial map partial frap significantly associated lowered blood pressure elevated arterial elasticity multiple regression analysis suggests least lowered blood pressure achieved processes associated increased arterial elasticity,Cancer Metabolism
"A rapidly increasing proportion of the population in the United State is taking Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) or weight loss. Consequently, an increasing number of patients presenting with new cases of cancer also have a current prescription for GLP-1RAs. The impact of GLP-1RAs on metabolism is quite profound, and it is entirely reasonable to assume these agents are also very impactful on the metabolism of cancer cells, in addition to the general metabolism of the patient. Although these drugs are relatively recent on the market, the study of metabolism in cancer is a well-established field and we can make predictions about how GLP-1RAs will interface with cancer treatments. In fact, some evidence points to a possible neoadjuvant effect of these drugs for cancer patients that would justify the initiation of GLP-1RAs to support therapy in a subset of patients. At the same time, there is a very present concern that drugs that induce weight loss may also precipitate the loss of muscle mass -cachexia- in patients. Here, we will provide an overview the existing literature around diabetes and metabolism in the context of cancer and cachexia.",Cancer Metabolism,rapidly increasing proportion population united state taking glucagonlike peptide receptor agonists glpras type diabetes td weight loss consequently increasing number patients presenting new cases cancer also current prescription glpras impact glpras metabolism quite profound entirely reasonable assume agents also impactful metabolism cancer cells addition general metabolism patient although drugs relatively recent market study metabolism cancer wellestablished field make predictions glpras interface cancer treatments fact evidence points possible neoadjuvant effect drugs cancer patients would justify initiation glpras support therapy subset patients time present concern drugs induce weight loss may also precipitate loss muscle mass cachexia patients provide overview existing literature around diabetes metabolism context cancer cachexia,Cancer Metabolism
"The intake of dietary fiber can reduce the risk of several major chronic diseases, including colorectal cancer, obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Endogenous dietary fibers such as arabinoxylan (AX) and (1,3)(1,4)-β-glucan (BG), which have good palatability, are more suitable for addition to cereal foods. We studied starch digestion in the gelatinized AX/BG-starch complexes. To clarify the synergistic role of AX and BG in the starch digestion process and explore the effect of cell wall polysaccharides on the activity of digestive enzymes, the mechanism of action between cell wall polysaccharides and digestive enzymes was analyzed through fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The results of the interaction between cell wall polysaccharides and digestive enzymes showed that the higher the proportion of AX, the stronger the quenching effect on digestive enzymes and the lower the enzyme activity. During the digestion of the AX/BG-starch complexes, in addition to binding to the active sites of enzymes to reduce enzyme activity, AX and BG played a dominant role as barriers. On one hand, they prevented some water molecules from entering the interior of starch granules to inhibit gelatinization. On the other hand, they effectively reduced the bioaccessibility of digestive enzymes.",Cancer Metabolism,intake dietary fiber reduce risk several major chronic diseases including colorectal cancer obesity type ii diabetes cardiovascular diseases endogenous dietary fibers arabinoxylan ax glucan bg good palatability suitable addition cereal foods studied starch digestion gelatinized axbgstarch complexes clarify synergistic role ax bg starch digestion process explore effect cell wall polysaccharides activity digestive enzymes mechanism action cell wall polysaccharides digestive enzymes analyzed fluorescence spectroscopy uvvisible absorption spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy results interaction cell wall polysaccharides digestive enzymes showed higher proportion ax stronger quenching effect digestive enzymes lower enzyme activity digestion axbgstarch complexes addition binding active sites enzymes reduce enzyme activity ax bg played dominant role barriers one hand prevented water molecules entering interior starch granules inhibit gelatinization hand effectively reduced bioaccessibility digestive enzymes,Cancer Metabolism
"Methionine restriction (MR) has been found to alleviate the progression of diseases such as cognitive disorders and cancer, but it is not clear whether regulating methionine availability can have a beneficial effect on wheat gluten-induced celiac disease. We aimed to excavate the effects of MR on the celiac toxic effects of p31-43 gliadin peptide. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of MR on p31-43 gliadin peptide-induced oxidative damage, the elevation of tissue transglutaminase enzyme activity, the overexpression of inflammatory factors, the increase of permeability, and T-lymphocyte dysfunction by utilizing Caco-2 epithelial cells and lymphocytes derived from mouse mesenteric lymph nodes to elucidate the effectiveness of MR. Moreover, the potential mechanism of MR on innate and adaptive immune regulation was explored with the help of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), a critical metabolic intermediate in methionine cycle. We discovered that MR effectively suppressed the celiac toxic effects of p31-43 gliadin peptide. Furthermore, we illustrated the controlling role of SAM in MR to regulate the toxic effects of gliadin in terms of both gliadin-induced innate and adaptive immune responses and found that SAM could directly affect the effectiveness of MR.

"Hedyotis diffusa, a famous Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been extensively used clinically for thousands of years. Although the therapeutic effect of Hedyotis diffusa on tumors has attracted wide attention, components, and mechanisms against breast cancer (BRCA) have not been fully understood. The study aims to explore the active components and molecular mechanisms of Hedyotis diffusa against BRCA using network pharmacology combined with experimental validation. The results of network pharmacology indicated that quercetin was the most core component of Hedyotis diffusa. BIRC5, CDK1, FOS, and HSP90AA1 were considered candidate key targets of Hedyotis diffusa against BRCA. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that multiple cancer-related pathways are enriched, including pathways in cancer, estrogen signaling pathway, and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and the like. The results of in vitro experiments showed that quercetin inhibited the proliferation of both MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the experimental data demonstrated quercetin may decrease the expression level of BIRC5, CDK1, and HSP90AA1 in MCF-7 cells. Overall, results of the study indicated that quercetin may play a vital role in the anti-BRCA effect of Hedyotis diffusa, and quercetin can affect the expression of BIRC5, CDK1, and HSP90AA1 in MCF-7 cells.

"The rapidly emerging large-scale data in diverse biological research fields present valuable opportunities to explore the underlying mechanisms of tissue development and disease progression. However, few existing methods can simultaneously capture common and condition-specific association between different types of features across different biological conditions, such as cancer types or cell populations. Therefore, we developed the sparse tensor-based partial least squares (sTPLS) method, which integrates multiple pairs of datasets containing two types of features but derived from different biological conditions. We demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of sTPLS through simulation study and three biological applications. By integrating the pairwise pharmacogenomic data, sTPLS identified 11 gene-drug comodules with high biological functional relevance specific for seven cancer types and two comodules that shared across multi-type cancers, such as breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. When applied to single-cell data, it uncovered nine gene-peak comodules representing transcriptional regulatory relationships specific for five cell types and three comodules shared across similar cell types, such as intermediate and naïve B cells. Furthermore, sTPLS can be directly applied to tensor-structured data, successfully revealing shared and distinct cell communication patterns mediated by the MK signaling pathway in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and healthy controls. These results highlight the effectiveness of sTPLS in identifying biologically meaningful relationships across diverse conditions, making it useful for multi-omics integrative analysis.",Cancer Metabolism,rapidly emerging largescale data diverse biological research fields present valuable opportunities explore underlying mechanisms tissue development disease progression however existing methods simultaneously capture common conditionspecific association different types features across different biological conditions cancer types cell populations therefore developed sparse tensorbased partial least squares stpls method integrates multiple pairs datasets containing two types features derived different biological conditions demonstrated effectiveness versatility stpls simulation study three biological applications integrating pairwise pharmacogenomic data stpls identified genedrug comodules high biological functional relevance specific seven cancer types two comodules shared across multitype cancers breast ovarian colorectal cancers applied singlecell data uncovered nine genepeak comodules representing transcriptional regulatory relationships specific five cell types three comodules shared across similar cell types intermediate nave b cells furthermore stpls directly applied tensorstructured data successfully revealing shared distinct cell communication patterns mediated mk signaling pathway coronavirus disease patients healthy controls results highlight effectiveness stpls identifying biologically meaningful relationships across diverse conditions making useful multiomics integrative analysis,Cancer Metabolism
"During retrovirus assembly, Gag packages unspliced viral RNA as the virion genome. Genome packaging is usually specific with occasional exceptions of cross-packaging RNA from distantly related retroviruses. For example, HIV-1 Gag can efficiently package HIV-2 RNA. To better understand how HIV-1 Gag selects packaging substrates, we defined elements in the HIV-2 5' untranslated region (UTR) that are important for this process. Although sharing little homology, both HIV-1 and HIV-2 5' UTRs have unpaired guanosines essential for packaging by their own Gag. Simultaneously substituting guanosines of nine sites in the HIV-2 5' UTR caused severe defects in HIV-1 Gag-mediated packaging. Two of the nine sites are particularly important, mutating each one impaired HIV-1 Gag-mediated packaging, whereas the other sites required mutations in multiple sites to produce similar effects. Additionally, we identified one site that impacts HIV-1 Gag but is dispensable for HIV-2 Gag selective packaging. Furthermore, combining mutations has an additive effect on packaging defects for HIV-1 Gag, in contrast to the previously reported synergistic effects for HIV-2 Gag. Our study demonstrates that Gag proteins from two different retroviruses recognize and use mostly the same set of cis-acting elements to mediate RNA packaging and provide the mechanistic basis for genome cross-packaging.",Cancer Metabolism,retrovirus assembly gag packages unspliced viral rna virion genome genome packaging usually specific occasional exceptions crosspackaging rna distantly related retroviruses example hiv gag efficiently package hiv rna better understand hiv gag selects packaging substrates defined elements hiv untranslated region utr important process although sharing little homology hiv hiv utrs unpaired guanosines essential packaging gag simultaneously substituting guanosines nine sites hiv utr caused severe defects hiv gagmediated packaging two nine sites particularly important mutating one impaired hiv gagmediated packaging whereas sites required mutations multiple sites produce similar effects additionally identified one site impacts hiv gag dispensable hiv gag selective packaging furthermore combining mutations additive effect packaging defects hiv gag contrast previously reported synergistic effects hiv gag study demonstrates gag proteins two different retroviruses recognize use mostly set cisacting elements mediate rna packaging provide mechanistic basis genome crosspackaging,Cancer Metabolism
"Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) is an etiological agent of human cancers that requires endocytosis to initiate infection. HPV16 entry into epithelial cells occurs through a non-canonical endocytic pathway that is actin-driven, but it is not well understood how HPV16-cell surface interactions trigger actin reorganization in a way that facilitates entry. This study provides evidence that Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous proteins 1 and 2 (WAVE1 and WAVE2) are molecular mediators of actin protrusions that occur at the cellular surface upon HPV addition to cells, and that this stimulation is a key step prior to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. We demonstrate through post-transcriptional gene silencing and genome editing that WAVE1 and WAVE2 are critical for efficient HPV16 infection, and that restoration of each in knockout cells rescues HPV16 infection. Cells lacking WAVE1, WAVE2, or both internalize HPV16 at a significantly reduced rate. Microscopic analysis of fluorescently labeled cells revealed that HPV16, WAVE1, WAVE2, and actin are all colocalized at the cellular dorsal surface within a timeframe that precedes endocytosis. Within that same timeframe, we also found that HPV16-treated cells express cellular dorsal surface filopodia, which does not occur in cells lacking WAVE1 and WAVE2. Taken together, this study provides evidence that WAVE1 and WAVE2 mediate a key step prior to HPV entry into cells that involves actin reorganization in the form of cellular dorsal surface protrusions.",Cancer Metabolism,human papillomavirus type hpv etiological agent human cancers requires endocytosis initiate infection hpv entry epithelial cells occurs noncanonical endocytic pathway actindriven well understood hpvcell surface interactions trigger actin reorganization way facilitates entry study provides evidence wiskottaldrich syndrome protein family verprolinhomologous proteins wave wave molecular mediators actin protrusions occur cellular surface upon hpv addition cells stimulation key step prior endocytosis intracellular trafficking demonstrate posttranscriptional gene silencing genome editing wave wave critical efficient hpv infection restoration knockout cells rescues hpv infection cells lacking wave wave internalize hpv significantly reduced rate microscopic analysis fluorescently labeled cells revealed hpv wave wave actin colocalized cellular dorsal surface within timeframe precedes endocytosis within timeframe also found hpvtreated cells express cellular dorsal surface filopodia occur cells lacking wave wave taken together study provides evidence wave wave mediate key step prior hpv entry cells involves actin reorganization form cellular dorsal surface protrusions,Cancer Metabolism
"The cytoplasmic human Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3 or A3) cytidine deaminases G and F (A3G and A3F) can block the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV counteracts this cell-intrinsic defense through a viral protein called viral infectivity factor (Vif). Vif causes proteasomal degradation of A3G and A3F proteins (A3G/F) in HIV-producing cells to ensure infectivity of virions subsequently released from these cells. Here, we optimized a lead compound reported previously to boost cellular levels of A3G. The modified analogs designed, synthesized, and evaluated here inhibit cell-mediated post-translational degradation of A3G/F, whether Vif is present or not. This increases A3G/F incorporation into Vif-positive virions to decrease viral infectivity.

"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the sixth most prevalent type of cancer worldwide and is associated with low five-year survival rates.

In these cases, patients with HPV-positive HNC exhibit a better clinical prognosis; however, resistance to chemotherapy has been frequently reported. The carcinogenic activity of HPV is related to the viral oncoproteins E5, E6, and E7. E5 has been associated with immune evasion mechanisms and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, which appears to be linked to the virus's resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments.

"The human T-cell leukemia type-1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus establishes chronic life-long infection in a fraction of infected individuals associated with severe pathological conditions. Although the mechanism driving disease development is not fully understood, current evidence indicates the essential functions of viral regulatory proteins. Among these, the p13 protein has previously been shown to localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane in T cells, altering mitochondrial biology and T-cell function. While CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the primary cell target of HTLV-1 infection, genomic viral DNA has also been detected in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity and play a critical role in protecting against virus-induce diseases by establishing the appropriate balance of pro and anti-inflammatory responses. Given the central role of mitochondria in monocyte differentiation, we investigated the effect of p13 in monocytes/macrophages and found that by localizing to mitochondria, p13 affects mitochondrial respiration.

"Persistent infection with HPV causes nearly 5% of all cancers worldwide, including cervical and oropharyngeal cancers. Compared to HPV-negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), HPV-positive (HPV+) HNSCCs exhibit a significantly improved treatment response; however, established treatment regimens were largely developed for HPV- disease. Effectively de-escalating therapy and optimizing treatment protocols to minimize toxicity for both HPV+ and HPV- tumors has been variably successful, in part due to the heterogeneity of cellular subpopulations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has primarily been used to define immune cell populations rather than the cell type of origin, epithelial cells. To address this, we analyzed published scRNAseq data of HPV+ and HPV- HNSCCs to distinguish epithelial tumor cell populations as a function of HPV status. We identified the transcriptome signatures, ontologies, and candidate biomarkers of newly identified epithelial subpopulations with attention to those that are shared or enriched in HPV+ or HPV- HNSCCs. We hypothesize that distinct epithelial cell populations and reprogramming in HPV- versus HPV+ HNSCC represent important components of the pro-tumor environment. These are described here as a foundation for the identification of new epithelial-cell-specific biomarkers, effectors, and candidate targets for optimizing the treatment of HNSCC.",Cancer Metabolism,persistent infection hpv causes nearly cancers worldwide including cervical oropharyngeal cancers compared hpvnegative hpv head neck squamous cell carcinomas hnsccs hpvpositive hpv hnsccs exhibit significantly improved treatment response however established treatment regimens largely developed hpv disease effectively deescalating therapy optimizing treatment protocols minimize toxicity hpv hpv tumors variably successful part due heterogeneity cellular subpopulations singlecell rna sequencing scrnaseq primarily used define immune cell populations rather cell type origin epithelial cells address analyzed published scrnaseq data hpv hpv hnsccs distinguish epithelial tumor cell populations function hpv status identified transcriptome signatures ontologies candidate biomarkers newly identified epithelial subpopulations attention shared enriched hpv hpv hnsccs hypothesize distinct epithelial cell populations reprogramming hpv versus hpv hnscc represent important components protumor environment described foundation identification new epithelialcellspecific biomarkers effectors candidate targets optimizing treatment hnscc,Cancer Metabolism

"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths among women. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a critical role in tumor development, and targeting this pathway may provide new therapeutic opportunities for TNBC. TPB15 is a novel smoothened inhibitor of the Hh pathway, showing promising tumor reduction and low-toxicity properties in vivo/vitro. This study aims to evaluate TPB15's protein binding rates, metabolic stability, and metabolism across different species, including mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. <b>Methods</b>: TPB15 was synthesized, and its pharmacokinetic profile was assessed. Plasma protein binding was determined using ultrafiltration across multiple species. Stability studies were conducted in plasma and liver microsomes from each species. Additionally, metabolic enzymes in human liver microsomes were characterized with selective CYP450 inhibitors, and high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to identify metabolites. <b>Results</b>: Plasma protein binding of TPB15 was consistent across species, ranging from 81.5% to 82.4% in humans and rats. After 120 min, TPB15 remained stable in plasma, with retention rates of 97.2-98.3%. The elimination half-life (<i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>) varied from 88 min in monkeys to 630 min in dogs. In human liver microsomes, metabolism was significantly inhibited by sulfaphenazole and ketoconazole, indicating the involvement of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes. TPB15 underwent phase I metabolism, producing a major metabolite with a molecular weight of 468.9. <b>Conclusions</b>: TPB15 demonstrates stable pharmacokinetic properties across species, with consistent protein binding and significant variability in half-life.

"<b>Background</b>: Diet is one of the most significant modifiable lifestyle factors influencing human health, contributing to both morbidity and mortality. Genetic variations in the pleiotropic 9p21 risk locus further shape premature aging, disease susceptibility, and have been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic disorders, certain cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. However, given that this region was discovered based on Genome-Wide Association Studies, the mechanisms by which 9p21 exerts its effects remain poorly understood and its interactions with diet and biomarkers are insufficiently explored. <b>Methods</b>: This study investigated the association between the rs2383206 SNP in 9p21, dietary patterns, and plasma proteomic biomarkers in a multi-ethnic cohort of 1280 young adults from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. Participants' dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were categorized using principal component analysis. Plasma proteomics analyses quantified 54 abundant proteins involved in the cardiometabolic and inflammatory pathways. Genotyping identified individuals who were homozygous for the 9p21 risk allele (GG), known to confer the highest susceptibility risk to premature aging and multiple chronic diseases. <b>Results</b>: A significant interaction was observed between the 9p21 genotype and adherence to a micronutrient-rich Prudent dietary pattern for eight plasma proteins (α<sub>1</sub> Antichymotrypsin, Complement C4 β chain, Complement C4 γ chain, Complement C9, Fibrinogen α chain, Hemopexin, and Serum amyloid P-component). However, only Complement C4-γ showed a pattern consistent with the risks associated with the 9p21 genotype and adherence to a Prudent diet. Individuals with the high-risk GG genotype had significantly higher concentrations of Complement C4-γ, but only among those with a low adherence to a Prudent diet. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that Prudent dietary patterns rich in micronutrients may counteract genetic-mediated proinflammatory susceptibility by modulating key proteomic biomarkers in young adults, highlighting the potential for tailored dietary interventions to mitigate disease risk. This study also introduces a novel framework for post hoc micronutrient resolution within dietary pattern analysis, offering a new lens to interpret nutrient synergies in gene-diet interaction research.",Cancer Metabolism,bbackgroundb diet one significant modifiable lifestyle factors influencing human health contributing morbidity mortality genetic variations pleiotropic p risk locus shape premature aging disease susceptibility strongly linked cardiovascular disease cvd metabolic disorders certain cancers neurodegenerative conditions however given region discovered based genomewide association studies mechanisms p exerts effects remain poorly understood interactions diet biomarkers insufficiently explored bmethodsb study investigated association rs snp p dietary patterns plasma proteomic biomarkers multiethnic cohort young adults toronto nutrigenomics health study participants dietary intake assessed using validated food frequency questionnaire dietary patterns categorized using principal component analysis plasma proteomics analyses quantified abundant proteins involved cardiometabolic inflammatory pathways genotyping identified individuals homozygous p risk allele gg known confer highest susceptibility risk premature aging multiple chronic diseases bresultsb significant interaction observed p genotype adherence micronutrientrich prudent dietary pattern eight plasma proteins subsub antichymotrypsin complement c chain complement c chain complement c fibrinogen chain hemopexin serum amyloid pcomponent however complement c showed pattern consistent risks associated p genotype adherence prudent diet individuals highrisk gg genotype significantly higher concentrations complement c among low adherence prudent diet bconclusionsb findings suggest prudent dietary patterns rich micronutrients may counteract geneticmediated proinflammatory susceptibility modulating key proteomic biomarkers young adults highlighting potential tailored dietary interventions mitigate disease risk study also introduces novel framework post hoc micronutrient resolution within dietary pattern analysis offering new lens interpret nutrient synergies genediet interaction research,Cancer Metabolism
"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Phosphorus plays a fundamental role in cellular and extracellular metabolism, contributing to nucleic acid synthesis, enzymatic activity, neurologic function, and skeletal mineralization. Despite its significance, non-severe hypophosphatemia (HP) remains largely asymptomatic and underdiagnosed, with limited data on its prevalence in the general population. Most studies focus on specific subgroups, such as critically ill or dialysis patients, while the impact of mild HP in older adults, a potentially vulnerable demographic, is not well understood. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the prevalence and clinical implications of non-severe HP in older adults. <b>Methods:</b> The study followed PRISMA guidelines to assess HP in patients aged ≥ 65 years without critical illnesses or genetic disorders. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus (March 2024). Eligible studies included RCTs and prospective/retrospective studies, excluding cancer-related studies or insufficient phosphate data. <b>Results:</b> We identified 1350 articles, with 26 meeting eligibility criteria. Ultimately, eight studies involving 26,548 patients were included, with an HP prevalence of 12.5%. Studies reveal a higher prevalence of HP in frail individuals, particularly those with increased frailty scores, and an association between HP and cognitive decline, depressed mood, falls, and chronic comorbidities. HP was also prevalent in infectious diseases, especially bacterial pneumonia, with longer hospital stays and increased mortality rates. Malnutrition was significantly more common in HP patients, characterized by weight loss and poor nutritional status. Furthermore, HP increased fall risk during hospitalization and worsened outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, including higher mortality and graft failure rates, underscoring its clinical importance. <b>Discussion:</b> This review identified that non-severe hypophosphatemia (HP) is associated with conditions such as frailty, cognitive decline, and an increased risk of falls. The evidence suggests that low phosphate levels may negatively impact health, increasing mortality and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Despite limitations in diagnostic criteria and sample variability, the findings indicate that HP can be a useful marker for identifying patients at risk of health deterioration. Further research is needed to clearly define the management and treatment of HP in this vulnerable population.",Cancer Metabolism,bbackgroundobjectivesb phosphorus plays fundamental role cellular extracellular metabolism contributing nucleic acid synthesis enzymatic activity neurologic function skeletal mineralization despite significance nonsevere hypophosphatemia hp remains largely asymptomatic underdiagnosed limited data prevalence general population studies focus specific subgroups critically ill dialysis patients impact mild hp older adults potentially vulnerable demographic well understood objective systematic review investigate prevalence clinical implications nonsevere hp older adults bmethodsb study followed prisma guidelines assess hp patients aged years without critical illnesses genetic disorders systematic search conducted pubmed web science scopus march eligible studies included rcts prospectiveretrospective studies excluding cancerrelated studies insufficient phosphate data bresultsb identified articles meeting eligibility criteria ultimately eight studies involving patients included hp prevalence studies reveal higher prevalence hp frail individuals particularly increased frailty scores association hp cognitive decline depressed mood falls chronic comorbidities hp also prevalent infectious diseases especially bacterial pneumonia longer hospital stays increased mortality rates malnutrition significantly common hp patients characterized weight loss poor nutritional status furthermore hp increased fall risk hospitalization worsened outcomes coronary artery bypass graft surgery including higher mortality graft failure rates underscoring clinical importance bdiscussionb review identified nonsevere hypophosphatemia hp associated conditions frailty cognitive decline increased risk falls evidence suggests low phosphate levels may negatively impact health increasing mortality risk adverse clinical outcomes despite limitations diagnostic criteria sample variability findings indicate hp useful marker identifying patients risk health deterioration research needed clearly define management treatment hp vulnerable population,Cancer Metabolism
"Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune system, with immunomodulatory effects that are key in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). Over the past decades, research has shown that this steroid hormone impacts much more than bone health, significantly influencing immune responses. Vitamin D enhances immune organ functions such as the spleen and lymph nodes, and boosts T-cell activity, which is essential in defending the body against tumors. Additionally, vitamin D mitigates inflammatory responses closely linked to cancer development, reducing the inflammation that contributes to CRC. It acts via vitamin D receptors (VDRs) expressed on immune cells, modulating immune responses. Adequate vitamin D levels influence gene expression related to inflammation and cell proliferation, inhibiting tumor development. Vitamin D also activates mechanisms that suppress cancer cell survival, proliferation, migration, and metastasis. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of CRC, with deficiency correlating with higher disease incidence. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in red meat and calories but low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, as well as physical inactivity, contribute significantly to CRC risk. Insufficient calcium and vitamin D intake are also linked to disease occurrence and poorer clinical outcomes. Maintaining optimal vitamin D levels and adequate dietary intake is crucial in preventing CRC and improving patient prognosis. This review explores the role of vitamin D in immune regulation and summarizes findings from randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation on CRC outcomes.",Cancer Metabolism,vitamin plays crucial role regulation immune system immunomodulatory effects key prevention colorectal cancer crc past decades research shown steroid hormone impacts much bone health significantly influencing immune responses vitamin enhances immune organ functions spleen lymph nodes boosts tcell activity essential defending body tumors additionally vitamin mitigates inflammatory responses closely linked cancer development reducing inflammation contributes crc acts via vitamin receptors vdrs expressed immune cells modulating immune responses adequate vitamin levels influence gene expression related inflammation cell proliferation inhibiting tumor development vitamin also activates mechanisms suppress cancer cell survival proliferation migration metastasis low levels vitamin associated increased risk crc deficiency correlating higher disease incidence lifestyle factors diet high red meat calories low fiber fruits vegetables well physical inactivity contribute significantly crc risk insufficient calcium vitamin intake also linked disease occurrence poorer clinical outcomes maintaining optimal vitamin levels adequate dietary intake crucial preventing crc improving patient prognosis review explores role vitamin immune regulation summarizes findings randomized clinical trials assessing effects vitamin supplementation crc outcomes,Cancer Metabolism
"Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is an intermediate product during the metabolism of methionine, a vital amino acid. An elevated concentration of homocysteine in the plasma, named hyperhomocysteinemia, has been significantly related to the onset of several diseases, including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An interaction between metabolic pathways of homocysteine and gut microbiota has been reported, and specific microbial signatures have been found in individuals experiencing hyperhomocysteinemia. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that gut microbial modulation may exert an influence on homocysteine levels and related disease progression. Conventional approaches for managing hyperhomocysteinemia typically involve dietary interventions alongside the administration of supplements such as B vitamins and betaine. The present review aims to synthesize recent advancements in understanding interventions targeted at mitigating hyperhomocysteinemia, with a particular emphasis on the role of gut microbiota in these strategies. The emerging therapeutic potential of gut microbiota has been reported for several diseases. Indeed, a better understanding of the complex interaction between microbial species and homocysteine metabolism may help in finding novel therapeutic strategies to counteract hyperhomocysteinemia.",Cancer Metabolism,homocysteine sulfurcontaining amino acid intermediate product metabolism methionine vital amino acid elevated concentration homocysteine plasma named hyperhomocysteinemia significantly related onset several diseases including diabetes multiple sclerosis osteoporosis cancer neurodegenerative disorders dementia alzheimers parkinsons diseases interaction metabolic pathways homocysteine gut microbiota reported specific microbial signatures found individuals experiencing hyperhomocysteinemia furthermore evidence suggests gut microbial modulation may exert influence homocysteine levels related disease progression conventional approaches managing hyperhomocysteinemia typically involve dietary interventions alongside administration supplements b vitamins betaine present review aims synthesize recent advancements understanding interventions targeted mitigating hyperhomocysteinemia particular emphasis role gut microbiota strategies emerging therapeutic potential gut microbiota reported several diseases indeed better understanding complex interaction microbial species homocysteine metabolism may help finding novel therapeutic strategies counteract hyperhomocysteinemia,Cancer Metabolism
"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The kinase p38α, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, is activated by external stimuli and plays a crucial role in inflammation, tumor growth, and metabolic disorders. In particular, p38α is involved in thermogenesis and the metabolism of glucose in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and it contributes to the suppression of obesity and diabetes. The noninvasive imaging of activated p38α could help elucidate diverse pathological processes, including metabolic and inflammatory conditions. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a novel fluorine-18-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) probe for imaging activated p38α in vivo. <b>Methods:</b> We designed 6-(4-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-2-fluorophenoxy)-8-methyl-2-(tetrahydro-2<i>H</i>-pyran-4-ylamino)-pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>]pyrimidin-7(8<i>H</i>)-one ([<sup>18</sup>F]R1487) by replacing a fluorine atom in R1487, which is a highly selective p38α inhibitor, with <sup>18</sup>F.

"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Curcumin has well-established efficacy in a variety of disorders due to its prominent antioxidant, antiaging, anti-inflammatory, chemosensitizing, and anticancer activities. Despite its numerous benefits, curcumin exhibits low bioavailability mainly due to its poor solubility, poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and quick excretion, consequently limiting its clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the most convenient ingredients in SLNs to enhance curcumin's solubility by examining the effects of multiple independent variables simultaneously using an experimental design. <b>Methods</b>: After curcumin's saturation solubility was investigated, SLN formulations were produced. The optimum formulation was determined with the help of experimental design. The SLNs were characterized in terms of the particle size and distribution, zeta potential, shape, entrapment efficiency, drug loading capacity, and drug release. The cell viability and cell internalization were also evaluated. <b>Results</b>: An impressive synergistic effect was achieved with the combination of Brij and Gelucire 48/16, which increased curcumin's solubility in water by 452.5 times. Curcumin-loaded SLNs were successfully produced with a spherical shape and particle size of 389.3 ± 9.95 nm. The encapsulation efficiency was directly proportionate to the amount of curcumin and the stirring speed. Curcumin in the SLNs entered the cancer cells more easily than curcumin alone. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our results demonstrate that the quantity of surfactant is a significant factor influencing the efficiency of drug loading. Finally, the 3:1 (Brij-Gelucire48/16) ratio markedly enhanced the loading efficiency. The cellular internalization and, consequently, the anticancer efficacy against adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells were improved with SLNs.

"Physical stimulation, which is a key factor affecting the metabolism of osteoblasts and their precursor cells, plays an important role in bone remodeling; however, the role of micro-vibrations in osteoblast differentiation is unclear. In the present study, we determined the effects of frequency-regulated repeated micro-vibration (FRMV) on cell proliferation and established a method to induce osteoblast differentiation through FRMV using the mouse pre-osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1, which is widely used in bone metabolism research. The results indicated that FRMV significantly influenced the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells in a normal growth medium. FRMV at 42.2 Hz significantly promoted proliferation, whereas FRMV at 92.1 Hz showed no effect on the proliferation rate. Moreover, FRMV at 42.2 Hz significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity and ALP gene expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Treatment with LDN193189, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling inhibitor, revealed that the FRMV-induced upregulation in ALP enzyme activity and ALP gene expression were significantly suppressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. The results suggest that the FRMV protocol developed in the present study induces osteoblast differentiation through the BMP signaling pathway. Thus, FRMV may contribute to the development of effective bone regeneration technologies.",Cancer Metabolism,physical stimulation key factor affecting metabolism osteoblasts precursor cells plays important role bone remodeling however role microvibrations osteoblast differentiation unclear present study determined effects frequencyregulated repeated microvibration frmv cell proliferation established method induce osteoblast differentiation frmv using mouse preosteoblastlike cell line mcte widely used bone metabolism research results indicated frmv significantly influenced proliferation mcte cells normal growth medium frmv hz significantly promoted proliferation whereas frmv hz showed effect proliferation rate moreover frmv hz significantly increased alkaline phosphatase alp enzyme activity alp gene expression mcte cells treatment ldn bone morphogenetic protein bmp signaling inhibitor revealed frmvinduced upregulation alp enzyme activity alp gene expression significantly suppressed mcte cells results suggest frmv protocol developed present study induces osteoblast differentiation bmp signaling pathway thus frmv may contribute development effective bone regeneration technologies,Cancer Metabolism
"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Glucose Transporter-1 (GLUT1) is the key target gene for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which helps cells uptake glucose during cell division, malignant transformation, and nutrient depletion. Cancer hypoxia is a well-known condition caused by an oxygen imbalance in the cancer microenvironment. During chronic hypoxia, certain cancer cells can survive and adapt. These cellular alterations can make cancer more aggressive, causing invasion and metastasis. The study investigated the presence of GLUT1 in oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) and various histopathological grades of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to assess the significance of GLUT1 as a prognostic indicator. <i>Material and Methods</i>: A total of 40 samples of tissue blocks, including 5 cases of normal oral mucosa, 5 cases of epithelial dysplasia, and 30 cases of OSCC with 10 cases each of well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated OSCCs, these cases were diagnosed using the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining technique. GLUT1 expression was assessed using immunohistochemical staining, which involved evaluating the location of the stain and the percentage of staining. <i>Results</i>: The mean area percent was highest in poorly differentiated cases (47.37) and lowest in well-differentiated cases (13.42). In poorly differentiated cases, diffuse expression was observed in almost all malignant cells, exhibiting membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. A significant difference (<i>p</i> < 0.001) between all groups in regard to immunostaining was detected. <i>Conclusions:</i> GLUT1 expression increased from oral epithelial dysplasia to oral squamous cell carcinoma histological grades.

"Tumor diameter may not reflect tumor burden accurately in all cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between tumor volume (TV) and aggressive features and prognosis in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Patients diagnosed with single foci PTC were recruited for the study. The largest tumor diameter was considered as the primary tumor diameter. TV was calculated using the formula for an ellipsoid shape, considering the three pathologically specified dimensions. Primary tumor diameter and TV were compared in terms of aggressive tumor characteristics and prognosis. The data of 118 patients were analyzed. There was no significant relationship between primary tumor diameter and lymph node metastasis (LNM), extrathyroidal extension (ETE), and vascular invasion (<i>p</i> > 0.05 for each). In patients with tumor diameter >2 cm, TV was negatively associated with LNM (<i>p</i> = 0.015). One-unit increase in TV was associated with 1.629 times greater likelihood of absence of LNM (95% CI: 1.099-2.415). When the TV was ≤5.26 cm<sup>3</sup>, the sensitivity and specificity for the presence of LNM were 88.9% and 75.8%, respectively. Again in this group, the sensitivity for the occurrence of ETE was 100.0% and specificity was 45.7% when the TV was ≤9.49 cm<sup>3</sup>. There was no significant difference in the five-year disease-free survival between tumor diameter and TV. In contrary to studies with other cancer types in the literature, there was a significant but negative relationship between TV and LNM.

"Paclitaxel is a type of small molecule chemotherapy widely used for breast cancer, but its clinical efficacy is often hindered by dose-limiting toxicities such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia. Traditional dosing based on body surface area does not account for variations in body composition, which may influence paclitaxel metabolism, toxicity, and treatment outcomes. This review explores the interplay between body composition, physical activity, and paclitaxel pharmacokinetics, emphasizing the potential for personalized dosing strategies. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted by analyzing the literature on body composition, small molecule chemotherapy-related toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and exercise oncology. Studies examining the role of skeletal muscle mass, adipose tissue, and physical activity in modulating paclitaxel metabolism and side effects were included. Evidence suggests that patients with low skeletal muscle mass are at a higher risk of paclitaxel-induced toxicities due to altered drug distribution and clearance. Sarcopenic obesity, characterized by low muscle and high-fat levels, further exacerbates these risks. Exercise, particularly resistance and aerobic training, has been shown to improve muscle mass, mitigate toxicities, and enhance chemotherapy tolerance. However, the precise mechanisms by which exercise influences paclitaxel pharmacokinetics remain underexplored. Personalized chemotherapy dosing, considering body composition and physical activity, may optimize paclitaxel treatment outcomes. Future research should focus on integrating exercise interventions into oncology care and refining dosing models that account for interindividual differences in drug metabolism. These advancements could improve treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicities in breast cancer patients.",Cancer Metabolism,paclitaxel type small molecule chemotherapy widely used breast cancer clinical efficacy often hindered doselimiting toxicities chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy neutropenia traditional dosing based body surface area account variations body composition may influence paclitaxel metabolism toxicity treatment outcomes review explores interplay body composition physical activity paclitaxel pharmacokinetics emphasizing potential personalized dosing strategies comprehensive narrative review conducted analyzing literature body composition small molecule chemotherapyrelated toxicities pharmacokinetics exercise oncology studies examining role skeletal muscle mass adipose tissue physical activity modulating paclitaxel metabolism side effects included evidence suggests patients low skeletal muscle mass higher risk paclitaxelinduced toxicities due altered drug distribution clearance sarcopenic obesity characterized low muscle highfat levels exacerbates risks exercise particularly resistance aerobic training shown improve muscle mass mitigate toxicities enhance chemotherapy tolerance however precise mechanisms exercise influences paclitaxel pharmacokinetics remain underexplored personalized chemotherapy dosing considering body composition physical activity may optimize paclitaxel treatment outcomes future research focus integrating exercise interventions oncology care refining dosing models account interindividual differences drug metabolism advancements could improve treatment efficacy minimizing toxicities breast cancer patients,Cancer Metabolism
"Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), including CAR-T and TCR-T therapies, shows promise for cancer treatment, depending on infused T cell expansion, persistence and activity.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a challenging and malignant cancer, primarily originates from the exocrine cells of the pancreas. The superfamily of solute carrier (SLC) transporters, consisting of more than 450 proteins divided into 65 families, is integral to various cellular processes and represents a promising target in precision oncology. As therapeutic targets, SLC transporters are explored through an integrative analysis. The expression profiles of SLCs were systematically analyzed using mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and protein data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). Survival analysis was examined to evaluate the prognostic significance of SLC transporters for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Genetic alterations were examined using cBioPortal, while structural studies were performed with AlphaFold and AlphaMissense to predict functional impacts. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was carried out to identify oncogenic pathways linked to SLC transporter expression. SLC transporters were significantly upregulated in tumors relative to normal tissues. Higher expression levels of SLC39A10 (HR = 1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.0026), SLC22B5 (HR = 1.84, <i>p</i> = 0.0042), SLC55A2 (HR = 2.15, <i>p</i> = 0.00023), and SLC30A6 (HR = 1.90, <i>p</i> = 0.003) were strongly associated with unfavorable OS, highlighting their connection to poor prognosis in PDAC. GSEA highlighted that these four transporters are significantly involved in key oncogenic pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), TNF-α signaling, and angiogenesis. The study identifies four SLCs as therapeutic targets in PDAC, highlighting their crucial role in essential metabolic pathways.

"Quercetin, a dietary flavonoid and a widely used supplement, has hepatoprotective properties. Given its urate-lowering effects and epidemiological evidence linking elevated serum urate levels to liver cancer risk, we tested whether quercetin reduces liver cancer risk via modulation of urate levels by bioinformatics methods. We employed drug-target Mendelian randomization using genome-wide association study summary statistics from public databases (e.g., MRC-IEU) to assess genetic associations, and integrated these findings with GEO datasets (such as GSE138709 and GSE179443) and immune infiltration analyses using tools like xCell, TIMER. Our analyses identified <i>ABCG2</i>-mediated urate elevation as a causal risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 1.001, <i>p</i> < 0.01), cholangiocarcinoma (OR = 3.424, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and liver fibrosis (OR = 2.528, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed elevated <i>ABCG2</i> expression in cholangiocarcinoma endothelial cells, while immune infiltration analysis showed significant associations between <i>ABCG2</i> expression and both endothelial cell and macrophage infiltration. Survival analysis further indicated that <i>ABCG2</i> was not associated with poor prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma.

"<b>Background:</b> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and highly lethal form of liver cancer, with limited effective treatment options, particularly in the advanced stages. Immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has emerged as a promising treatment modality, yet a substantial proportion of patients exhibit resistance or fail to respond to such therapies. This study aimed to elucidate the role of G0/G1 Switch 2 (G0S2) in regulating PD-L1 expression in monocytes within the HCC tumor microenvironment and to investigate its impact on the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors. <b>Methods:</b> Gene expression data among HCC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors were obtained from the HCC single-cell sequencing database; immunohistochemistry was performed to detect G0S2 expression in liver cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues of HCC patients; flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the expression of G0S2, PD-L1, CD206, and CD14 in PBMCs from HCC patients; and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion were used to evaluate the impact of G0S2 knockdown. <b>Results:</b> Utilizing single-cell sequencing data from HCC patients, we identified that G0S2 expression was significantly elevated in the non-responders (NR) compared to responders (R) to PD-1 inhibitor therapy. The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels of G0S2 in HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues, while the flow cytometry revealed the increased expression of G0S2, PD-L1, and CD206 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from NR patients compared to R patients and healthy controls. The functional experiments involving the knockdown of G0S2 in the THP-1 monocyte cell line resulted in a significant reduction in PD-L1 expression and a concomitant increase in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings indicate that G0S2 facilitates the upregulation of PD-L1 in monocytes, thereby suppressing T cell activity and contributing to resistance against PD-1 inhibitors in HCC. The high expression of G0S2 in peripheral blood monocytes offers a non-invasive and easily detectable biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Consequently, targeting G0S2 may enhance the responsiveness to immunotherapy in HCC patients, providing a new avenue for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.",Cancer Metabolism,bbackgroundb hepatocellular carcinoma hcc prevalent highly lethal form liver cancer limited effective treatment options particularly advanced stages immunotherapy using pd inhibitors emerged promising treatment modality yet substantial proportion patients exhibit resistance fail respond therapies study aimed elucidate role gg switch gs regulating pdl expression monocytes within hcc tumor microenvironment investigate impact efficacy pd inhibitors bmethodsb gene expression data among hcc patients treated pd inhibitors obtained hcc singlecell sequencing database immunohistochemistry performed detect gs expression liver cancer tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues hcc patients flow cytometry utilized analyze expression gs pdl cd cd pbmcs hcc patients cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn secretion used evaluate impact gs knockdown bresultsb utilizing singlecell sequencing data hcc patients identified gs expression significantly elevated nonresponders nr compared responders r pd inhibitor therapy immunohistochemical analysis confirmed higher levels gs hcc tumor tissues adjacent nontumorous tissues flow cytometry revealed increased expression gs pdl cd peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs nr patients compared r patients healthy controls functional experiments involving knockdown gs thp monocyte cell line resulted significant reduction pdl expression concomitant increase cdsupsupt cell proliferation ifn production bconclusionsb findings indicate gs facilitates upregulation pdl monocytes thereby suppressing cell activity contributing resistance pd inhibitors hcc high expression gs peripheral blood monocytes offers noninvasive easily detectable biomarker predicting efficacy pd inhibitor therapy consequently targeting gs may enhance responsiveness immunotherapy hcc patients providing new avenue optimizing treatment strategies improving patient outcomes,Cancer Metabolism

"<b>Background:</b> RNA alternative splicing represents a pivotal regulatory mechanism of eukaryotic gene expression, wherein splicing factors (SFs) serve as key regulators. Aberrant SF expression drives oncogenic splice variant production, thereby promoting tumorigenesis and malignant progression. However, the biological functions and potential targets of SFs remain largely underexplored. <b>Methods:</b> Through multi-omics analysis, we identified survival-related splicing factors (SFs) in esophageal cancer and elucidated their biological regulatory networks. To further investigate their downstream splicing targets, we combined alternative splicing events resulting from SF knockdown with those specific to esophageal cancer. Finally, these splicing events were validated through full-length RNA sequencing and confirmed in cancer cells and clinical specimens. <b>Result:</b> We identified six SFs that are highly expressed in esophageal cancer and correlate with poor prognosis. Further analysis revealed that these factors are significantly associated with immune infiltration, cancer stemness, tumor heterogeneity, and drug resistance. <i>CRNKL1</i> was identified as a hub SFs. The target genes and pathways regulated by these SFs showed substantial overlap, suggesting their coordinated roles in promoting cancer stemness and metastasis. Specifically, alternative splicing of key markers, such as CD44 and <i>CTTN</i>, was regulated by most of these SFs and correlated with poor prognosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study unveils six survival-related SFs that contribute to the aggressiveness of esophageal cancer and <i>CTTN</i> and <i>CD44</i> alternative splicing may act as common downstream effectors of survival-related SFs.

"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic approaches. This study analyzed gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in breast cancer. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was then employed using publicly available eQTL databases to evaluate potential causal relationships between these DEGs and breast cancer. Enrichment analyses were further conducted to explore their functional significance. Furthermore, external validation of co-expressed genes was conducted using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In vitro functional assays and drug sensitivity analyses were performed on selected target genes to validate their roles in breast cancer pathogenesis and treatment. A total of 1052 upregulated and 1380 downregulated genes were identified in breast cancer. Additionally, MR analysis revealed 12 significant co-expressed genes potentially contributing to breast cancer pathogenesis. These genes were primarily enriched in lipid metabolism and immune responses via regulating microRNA functions and AMPK signaling. Validation through the TCGA database confirmed differential expression of these genes in breast cancer tissues. Strikingly, functional assays of the less-reported genes DNASE2 and ATOH8 demonstrated their involvement in breast cancer pathogenesis through modulating proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Notably, several commonly used clinical drugs for breast cancer management, such as 5-Fluorouracil, exhibited dramatically increased sensitivity to DNASE2 and ATOH8 expression.

"High-fat diets (HFDs) have become increasingly prevalent in modern societies, driving rising rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Concurrently, radiation exposure from medical treatments and environmental sources poses health risks shaped by both biological and environmental factors. This review explores the intersection between HFDs and radiation sensitivity/susceptibility, focusing on how diet-induced metabolic alterations influence the body's response to radiation. Evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that HFDs significantly alter metabolism, leading to increased oxidative stress and immune system dysregulation. These metabolic changes can exacerbate radiation-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, potentially increasing radiation sensitivity in normal tissues. Conversely, obesity and HFD-induced metabolic disruptions may activate cellular pathways involved in DNA repair, cell survival, and inflammatory responses, fostering tumor resistance and modifying the tumor microenvironment, which may impair the efficacy of radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Understanding the interplay between diet and radiation exposure is critical for optimizing public health guidelines and improving therapeutic outcomes. These findings underscore the need for further research into dietary interventions that may mitigate radiation-associated risks.",Cancer Metabolism,highfat diets hfds become increasingly prevalent modern societies driving rising rates obesity metabolic syndrome concurrently radiation exposure medical treatments environmental sources poses health risks shaped biological environmental factors review explores intersection hfds radiation sensitivitysusceptibility focusing dietinduced metabolic alterations influence bodys response radiation evidence preclinical clinical studies indicates hfds significantly alter metabolism leading increased oxidative stress immune system dysregulation metabolic changes exacerbate radiationinduced oxidative stress inflammation dna damage potentially increasing radiation sensitivity normal tissues conversely obesity hfdinduced metabolic disruptions may activate cellular pathways involved dna repair cell survival inflammatory responses fostering tumor resistance modifying tumor microenvironment may impair efficacy radiation therapy cancer treatment understanding interplay diet radiation exposure critical optimizing public health guidelines improving therapeutic outcomes findings underscore need research dietary interventions may mitigate radiationassociated risks,Cancer Metabolism
"The peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) family plays a crucial role in balancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor cells. However, its potential role in prognosis and therapy response of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. In this study, we utilized 2 public single-cell RNA datasets and 8 bulk-RNA datasets to investigate the clinical value of six PRDXs family members in PCa. Expression comparison, biochemical recurrence analysis, and therapy response analysis were measured. Pathway enrichments were utilized to predict the potential down-stream pathway it may involve. In vitro experiments were used to validate the function of PRDX5 in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines. Among the PRDXs family, PRDX5 was most related to the advancement of prostate cancer. A nomogram integrating the expression of PRDX5 with clinical features was developed to better predict clinical outcomes in PCa patients compared to 30 published signatures. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify that PRDX5 expression was higher in advanced levels of PCa tissue. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and pathway predictive analysis revealed that the PRDX5 related genes were mainly relevant to ROS Pathway, Mitochondria-related functions, cellular respiration, and oxidative phosphorylation. In vitro cell proliferation assays, ROS determination assay, and apoptosis assay together revealed that depletion of PRDX5 induces apoptosis via ROS accumulation in CRPC cells. Moreover, the expression of PRDX5 in CRPC cells also affects the sensitivity to the ARSI therapy. This study offers new evidence for determining that the expression of PRDX5 is associated with advanced tumor grade, poor prognosis, and suboptimal response to multiple therapies in PCa within the PRDXs family.

"Chronic inhalation of titanium dioxide or carbon black can lead, at high exposure, to lung overload, and can induce chronic inflammation and lung cancer in rats. Whether this rat adverse response is predictive for humans has been questioned for more than 40 years. Currently, these particles are conservatively considered as possible human carcinogens. To clarify the mechanisms of the adverse rat response to lung overload and its human relevance. Primary rat and human alveolar macrophages were exposed in vitro to control, non-overload or overload doses of titanium dioxide (P25) or carbon black (Printex 90) particles, and their activation profile was examined by untargeted transcriptomics. Rat macrophages were largely the most responsive to particle overload. In particular, eighteen genes were identified as robust markers of P25 and Printex 90 overload in rat cells. The known functions of these genes can be related to the potential mechanisms of the adverse outcomes recorded in rats in vivo. Most of these 18 genes were similarly modulated in human macrophages, but with a markedly lower magnitude. In addition, a 16 gene signature was observed upon overload in human macrophages, but not in rat macrophages. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of lung overload and inflammation in rats, and highlight similarities and differences in transcriptomic responses of rat and human alveolar macrophages.",Cancer Metabolism,chronic inhalation titanium dioxide carbon black lead high exposure lung overload induce chronic inflammation lung cancer rats whether rat adverse response predictive humans questioned years currently particles conservatively considered possible human carcinogens clarify mechanisms adverse rat response lung overload human relevance primary rat human alveolar macrophages exposed vitro control nonoverload overload doses titanium dioxide p carbon black printex particles activation profile examined untargeted transcriptomics rat macrophages largely responsive particle overload particular eighteen genes identified robust markers p printex overload rat cells known functions genes related potential mechanisms adverse outcomes recorded rats vivo genes similarly modulated human macrophages markedly lower magnitude addition gene signature observed upon overload human macrophages rat macrophages findings provide insights mechanisms lung overload inflammation rats highlight similarities differences transcriptomic responses rat human alveolar macrophages,Cancer Metabolism
"Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) catalyzes the first two steps of the pentose-phosphate-pathway (PPP) within the endoplasmic reticulum, generating NADPH. H6PD modulates essential physiological processes, including energy and redox metabolism. Its sole reported interacting partner is 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1), utilizing NADPH to reactivate glucocorticoids, linking energy status with hormonal response. Previous studies showed that loss of H6PD affects breast cancer cell properties, independent of 11β-HSD1. It remains unknown whether this is due to impaired concentrations of NADPH or PPP products downstream of H6PD. To gain insight into novel roles and pathways influenced by this enzyme, we aimed to assess the H6PD interactome. We adapted the proximity-dependent Biotin Identification (BioID) method to identify novel H6PD interacting partners. First, we validated the method and confirmed the known interaction between H6PD and 11β-HSD1. Next, we constructed a triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell clone stably expressing a H6PD-biotin ligase fusion protein. Enriched biotinylated proteins were analyzed by mass-spectrometry and potential candidates assessed further by co-immunoprecipitation and functional assays. The resulting interactome revealed proteins of the calreticulin/calnexin cycle, unfolded-protein response (UPR) and chaperone activation pathways. Due to its known association with breast cancer, we examined the PDI Anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2) as H6PD interacting partner. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed multiple overlapping pathways enriched in breast cancer tissues with relatively high H6PD and AGR2 expression. These included glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, hypoxia, angiogenesis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) from MCF7 cells confirmed a physical interaction between H6PD and AGR2. ARG2 knockdown in these cells increased H6PD protein levels but decreased activity. Coexpression with AGR2 in HEK-293 cells did not affect expression but enhanced H6PD activity. BioID was successfully applied in the endoplasmic reticulum to identify AGR2 as H6PD interactor. This was confirmed using Co-IP from MCF7 cells endogenously expressing both proteins. The results indicate that AGR2 controls H6PD protein expression and enhances its activity. Whether higher H6PD activity due to increased AGR2 expression promotes a more aggressive cancer cell phenotype, for example by altering energy metabolism, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related processes or UPR and chaperone activation pathways, warrants further investigations.",Cancer Metabolism,hexosephosphate dehydrogenase hpd catalyzes first two steps pentosephosphatepathway ppp within endoplasmic reticulum generating nadph hpd modulates essential physiological processes including energy redox metabolism sole reported interacting partner hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase hsd utilizing nadph reactivate glucocorticoids linking energy status hormonal response previous studies showed loss hpd affects breast cancer cell properties independent hsd remains unknown whether due impaired concentrations nadph ppp products downstream hpd gain insight novel roles pathways influenced enzyme aimed assess hpd interactome adapted proximitydependent biotin identification bioid method identify novel hpd interacting partners first validated method confirmed known interaction hpd hsd next constructed triplenegative breast cancer mdamb cell clone stably expressing hpdbiotin ligase fusion protein enriched biotinylated proteins analyzed massspectrometry potential candidates assessed coimmunoprecipitation functional assays resulting interactome revealed proteins calreticulincalnexin cycle unfoldedprotein response upr chaperone activation pathways due known association breast cancer examined pdi anterior gradient protein agr hpd interacting partner gene set enrichment analysis revealed multiple overlapping pathways enriched breast cancer tissues relatively high hpd agr expression included glycolysis fatty acid metabolism hypoxia angiogenesis epithelial mesenchymal transition coimmunoprecipitation coip mcf cells confirmed physical interaction hpd agr arg knockdown cells increased hpd protein levels decreased activity coexpression agr hek cells affect expression enhanced hpd activity bioid successfully applied endoplasmic reticulum identify agr hpd interactor confirmed using coip mcf cells endogenously expressing proteins results indicate agr controls hpd protein expression enhances activity whether higher hpd activity due increased agr expression promotes aggressive cancer cell phenotype example altering energy metabolism casupsuprelated processes upr chaperone activation pathways warrants investigations,Cancer Metabolism
"Dengue virus (DENV) infection imposes a significant global health burden, driven by its ability to manipulate host cellular processes to facilitate replication and evade immune defenses. This review explores the complex interplay between DENV, host immunometabolism, and signaling pathways. DENV induces metabolic reprogramming, including glycolytic upregulation, lipid droplet utilization through lipophagy, and alterations in amino acid metabolism, to fulfill its energy and biosynthetic needs. The virus also disrupts mitochondrial dynamics, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which modulates immune responses but may also contribute to oxidative stress and severe pathology. Concurrently, DENV hijacks host signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT, to suppress apoptosis, evade type I interferon responses, and drive pro-inflammatory cytokine production. The interplay between these signaling and metabolic pathways highlights a dual role of host processes: enabling viral replication while activating antiviral immune responses. The review also examines potential therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic and signaling pathways to combat DENV infection, including glycolysis inhibitors, lipid metabolism modulators, and host-directed therapies.

"Clinical trials have shown that neoadjuvant anlotinib combined with PD-1 blockade therapy can prolong the survival of patients with driver gene negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but some patients fail to benefit from the combination therapy. To explore the potential drug resistance mechanism and predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in NSCLC patients, we used scRNA-seq to observe and analyze the dynamic changes of immune cells, stromal cells and cancer cells in NSCLC patients who received neoadjuvant combination therapy. We analyzed transcriptome data of ~ 47,000 single cells from 9 NSCLC patients, including 3 treatment naïve patients, 3 post-treatment patients with major pathological response (MPR), and 3 Non-MPR patients. Subsequently, the infiltration of immune cells was detected by immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence in NSCLC. In MPR patients, we found that neoadjuvant therapy reduced the expression of the T cell exhausted signature, reduced the transition of T_THEMIS cells to Tregs, and enhanced the positive feedback between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and PAX5<sup>+</sup> memory B cells. In Non-MPR patients, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dampen therapeutic efficiency by being the hub of cell communication. TAMs and fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via VEGF, endothelial ZEB1 may up-regulate FLT1 (VEGFR) expression in response to anlotinib, and VEGFR<sup>+</sup> endothelial cell signature can predict survival of NSCLC cohort in TCGA. In addition, PLA2G4A, the key enzyme in the VEGF pathway, was highly expressed in the tumor cells of Non-MPR patients after anlotinib treatment. In 135 NSCLC patients, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that PLA2G4A was positively correlated with poor prognosis and Tregs infiltration. In conclusion, VEGF signaling dependent dynamic changes in endothelial and epithelial cells are deeply involved in the formation of anlotinib resistance and immunosuppression phenotypes in NSCLC patients.",Cancer Metabolism,clinical trials shown neoadjuvant anlotinib combined pd blockade therapy prolong survival patients driver gene negative nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc patients fail benefit combination therapy explore potential drug resistance mechanism predict efficacy neoadjuvant therapy nsclc patients used scrnaseq observe analyze dynamic changes immune cells stromal cells cancer cells nsclc patients received neoadjuvant combination therapy analyzed transcriptome data single cells nsclc patients including treatment nave patients posttreatment patients major pathological response mpr nonmpr patients subsequently infiltration immune cells detected immunohistochemistry multiplex immunofluorescence nsclc mpr patients found neoadjuvant therapy reduced expression cell exhausted signature reduced transition tthemis cells tregs enhanced positive feedback cdsupsup cells paxsupsup memory b cells nonmpr patients tumorassociated macrophages tams dampen therapeutic efficiency hub cell communication tams fibroblasts stimulate endothelial cells via vegf endothelial zeb may upregulate flt vegfr expression response anlotinib vegfrsupsup endothelial cell signature predict survival nsclc cohort tcga addition plaga key enzyme vegf pathway highly expressed tumor cells nonmpr patients anlotinib treatment nsclc patients confirmed immunohistochemistry plaga positively correlated poor prognosis tregs infiltration conclusion vegf signaling dependent dynamic changes endothelial epithelial cells deeply involved formation anlotinib resistance immunosuppression phenotypes nsclc patients,Cancer Metabolism
"This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts-such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia-is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules-such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT-are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression-through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation-the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.",Cancer Metabolism,review discusses reprogramming breast tumor immune microenvironment immunosuppressive cold state immunologically active hot state complex interplay revealed accumulation metabolic byproductssuch lactate reactive oxygen species ros ammoniais shown impair tcell function promote tumor immune escape demonstrated tumor microenvironment tme dominated immunosuppressive cytokines including interleukin il transforming growth factor tgf il notably il produced regulatory cells breast cancer cells conversion conventional cells ilproducing induced regulatory cells along inhibition proinflammatory cytokine secretion contributes suppression antitumor immunity demonstrated key immune checkpoint moleculessuch pd pdl ctla tim lag tigitare upregulated within tme leading tcell exhaustion diminished immune responses blockade checkpoints shown restore tcell functionality proposed strategy convert cold tumors hot ones robust effector cell infiltration therapeutic potential chimeric antigen receptor cart cell therapy also explored targeting specific tumorassociated antigens glycoproteins receptor tyrosine kinases highlighted suggested cart cell efficacy enhanced combining cells immune checkpoint inhibitors immunomodulatory agents thereby overcoming barriers imposed immunosuppressive tme moreover role microbiome regulating estrogen metabolism systemic inflammation reviewed alterations gut microbiota shown affect tme microbiomebased interventions proposed additional means facilitate coldtohot transition concluded targeting metabolic immunological pathways underpin immune suppressionthrough combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade cart cell therapies microbiome modulationthe conversion breast tme cold hot achieved reprogramming anticipated enhance immune cell infiltration function thereby improving overall efficacy immunotherapies leading better clinical outcomes breast cancer patients,Cancer Metabolism
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a ""cold"" immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored ""hot"" inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.",Cancer Metabolism,immune checkpoint inhibitors icis present clinical benefits many cancer patients invariably fail glioblastoma gbm common deadly primary brain tumor lack icis efficacy gbm attributed accumulation tumorreprogrammed gliomaassociated myeloid cells gams create cold immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment tme impeding infiltration activation effector cells gbmderived vvintegrin ligands including spp shown mediate emergence gams hypothesized combination strategy aiming block reprogramming gams using synthetic aargd peptide targets sppintegrin signaling might overcome resistance icis reinvigorate antitumor immunity matrigel invasion assay used test efficacy aargd gliomamicroglia cocultures determined impact aargd administered monotherapy combined pd blockade tumor growth gams accumulation phenotypes arginase levels neovasculature experimental gliomas effects treatments tumor immune landscape dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry immunocytochemistry cytokine profiling rnaseq analysis sorted gams followed citeseq based data deconvolution aargd efficiently blocked microgliadependent invasion human mouse glioma cells vitro intratumorally delivered aargd alone reduce tumor growth orthotopic gliomas prevented emergence immunosuppressive gams led normalization peritumoral blood vessels combining aargd antipd antibody resulted reduced tumor growth increase number proliferating interferon producing cdsupsupt cells depletion regulatory cells transcriptomic profiles myeloid cells altered combined treatment reflecting restored hot inflammatory tme boosted immunotherapy responses intratumoral administration aargd similarly modified phenotypes gams human umg gliomas immunocompromised mice exploration transcriptomic datasets revealed high expression integrin receptor coding genes pretreatment biopsies associated poorer response immune checkpoint blockade patients several types cancers demonstrate combining blockade sppintegrin signaling icis modifies innate immunity reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses paves way improve immunotherapy outcomes gbm,Cancer Metabolism
"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common malignancies, characterized by high heterogeneity and poor outcomes. Effective classification for patient stratification and identifying reliable markers for prognosis prediction and treatment choice are crucial. Integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq analyses were used to characterize ESCC. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering was performed to stratify the ESCC patients into different subtypes and the clinical and pathological features of the ESCC subtypes were compared. Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were used to select key genes and construct a risk model for ESCC. The associations of the key genes with anti-cancer drug sensitivities in ESCC cell lines were investigated. RT-qRCR experiments, proteomics analysis, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) experiments were used to validate the results. Furthermore, one identified gene was selected to investigate its correlation with EGFR expression and the gene effect scores of various potential gene targets across pan-cancer. The study identified the dysregulated distributions of epithelial cells and fibroblasts as characteristic of ESCC. ESCC patients could be classified into four distinct subtypes with unique cell type features and prognoses. With the gene makers of the cell type features, a four-gene prognostic signature for ESCC was constructed. The CCND1-PKP1-JUP-ANKRD12 model could effectively discriminate the survival status of ESCC patients, independent of various pathological and clinical features. The risk score for the samples was correlated with the expression levels of immunoregulatory genes. The prognostic effects of CCND1, PKP1, and JUP were confirmed at the protein level. The phosphorylation levels of PKP1, JUP, and ANKRD12 were found to be dysregulated in ESCC tumors. Their expression dysregulation and heterogeneity were demonstrated in ESCC cell lines. All four genes were significantly correlated with at least one of the anti-cancer drug sensitivities in ESCC cell lines. PKP1 expression was significantly correlated with EGFR expression and gene effect scores in multiple cancers. We conclude that the CCND1-PKP1-JUP-ANKRD12 signature may serve as a novel indicator for ESCC prognosis and diagnosis. PKP1 expression might provide new clues for gene therapy efficacy in multiple cancers.",Cancer Metabolism,esophageal squamous cell carcinoma escc one common malignancies characterized high heterogeneity poor outcomes effective classification patient stratification identifying reliable markers prognosis prediction treatment choice crucial integration singlecell rnasequencing rnaseq bulk rnaseq analyses used characterize escc nonnegative matrix factorization nmf clustering performed stratify escc patients different subtypes clinical pathological features escc subtypes compared cox regression analysis lasso regression analysis used select key genes construct risk model escc associations key genes anticancer drug sensitivities escc cell lines investigated rtqrcr experiments proteomics analysis multiplex immunohistochemistry mihc experiments used validate results furthermore one identified gene selected investigate correlation egfr expression gene effect scores various potential gene targets across pancancer study identified dysregulated distributions epithelial cells fibroblasts characteristic escc escc patients could classified four distinct subtypes unique cell type features prognoses gene makers cell type features fourgene prognostic signature escc constructed ccndpkpjupankrd model could effectively discriminate survival status escc patients independent various pathological clinical features risk score samples correlated expression levels immunoregulatory genes prognostic effects ccnd pkp jup confirmed protein level phosphorylation levels pkp jup ankrd found dysregulated escc tumors expression dysregulation heterogeneity demonstrated escc cell lines four genes significantly correlated least one anticancer drug sensitivities escc cell lines pkp expression significantly correlated egfr expression gene effect scores multiple cancers conclude ccndpkpjupankrd signature may serve novel indicator escc prognosis diagnosis pkp expression might provide new clues gene therapy efficacy multiple cancers,Cancer Metabolism
"The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family genes were involved in the carcinogenesis and prognosis of multiple human tumors. The impact of MEF2s on the occurrences, progression, and clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer (PAAD) remains unknown. This study used the CCLE, HPA, EMBL-EBI, and GEPIA2 databases to study MEF2s expression in PAAD patients. We also investigated the relationship between MEF2s expression and methylation through the DiseaseMeth database, and used MEXPRESS to verify the association. Then we utilized the Kaplan-Meier Plotter and GEPIA2 databases to evaluate the prognostic value of MEF2s in PAAD. The cBioPortal database was used to explore the alteration features of MEF2s in PAAD. We then investigated the association between MEF2s expression, immune cells infiltration, and immune infiltration markers using the TIMER database. Finally, Metascape, STRING, and Cytoscape tools were used for functional enrichment analysis. MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D were found to be highly expressed in PAAD patients' tissues compared to normal tissues, whereas MEF2B expression did not show significant differential expression. In addition, the protein expression of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D was higher in PAAD tissues. Negative correlations were observed between the expression level of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D and the methylation levels in multiple sites. High expression of MEF2A was related to poor overall survival (p = 0.0071) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.0089) of PAAD. High expression of MEF2C was associated with worse RFS of PAAD (p = 0.043). MEF2A was a Truncating mutation, and it was shown that the ""G27Wfs*8"" mutation point was distributed in the SRF-TF domain. Both MEF2C and MEF2D were a Missense mutation. MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D expression was positively corresponded with five immune cells infiltration (CD8 + T cells, B-cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells), especially for CD8 + T cells and macrophages. Among the 20 pathways, hsa05140 (Leishmania infection), hsa04022 (cGMP-PKG signaling pathway), hsa05145 (Toxoplasmosis), hsa04371 (Apelin signaling pathway), and hsa04064 (NF-kappa B signaling pathway), were closely connected with the occurrence and development of PAAD. Our results indicated that the overexpression of MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D in patients with PAAD. MEF2A could be used as a prognostic biomarker for PAAD, MEF2C might be a potential oncogene for PAAD, and MEF2D had potential biological significance.",Cancer Metabolism,myocyte enhancer factor mef family genes involved carcinogenesis prognosis multiple human tumors impact mefs occurrences progression clinical outcome pancreatic cancer paad remains unknown study used ccle hpa emblebi gepia databases study mefs expression paad patients also investigated relationship mefs expression methylation diseasemeth database used mexpress verify association utilized kaplanmeier plotter gepia databases evaluate prognostic value mefs paad cbioportal database used explore alteration features mefs paad investigated association mefs expression immune cells infiltration immune infiltration markers using timer database finally metascape string cytoscape tools used functional enrichment analysis mefa mefc mefd found highly expressed paad patients tissues compared normal tissues whereas mefb expression show significant differential expression addition protein expression mefa mefc mefd higher paad tissues negative correlations observed expression level mefa mefc mefd methylation levels multiple sites high expression mefa related poor overall survival p relapsefree survival rfs p paad high expression mefc associated worse rfs paad p mefa truncating mutation shown gwfs mutation point distributed srftf domain mefc mefd missense mutation mefa mefc mefd expression positively corresponded five immune cells infiltration cd cells bcells neutrophils macrophages dendritic cells especially cd cells macrophages among pathways hsa leishmania infection hsa cgmppkg signaling pathway hsa toxoplasmosis hsa apelin signaling pathway hsa nfkappa b signaling pathway closely connected occurrence development paad results indicated overexpression mefa mefc mefd patients paad mefa could used prognostic biomarker paad mefc might potential oncogene paad mefd potential biological significance,Cancer Metabolism
"The potential links between triglyceride-glucose (TyG) related indicators and breast cancer incidence after menopause have been less well studied, and the joint associations between genetic risk, TyG related indicators, and breast cancer are unknown. Simple surrogate indicators of insulin resistance including TyG, TyG-waist circumference (TyG-WC), TyG-waist to height ratio (TyG-WHtR), TyG-waist to hip ratio (TyG-WHR), TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI). Genetic susceptibility in breast cancer was estimated by categorizing polygenic risk scores (PRS). For estimating the associations, we used Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Correlation shapes were evaluated using restricted cubic splines (RCS). Mediation analyses for assessing the role of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), C-reactive protein (CRP), testosterone, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in mediating the associations were conducted. The study included 83,873 UK biobank participants who were followed for a median of 13.8 years, with 3,561 new cases of postmenopausal breast cancer. Genetic risk and TyG related indicators were monotonically related to breast cancer, with additive but not multiplicative interactions between them. The highest quartiles of TyG, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR, TyG-WHR, and TyG-BMI were significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk with hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) were 1.12 (1.01-1.25), 1.35 (1.23-1.49), 1.16 (1.05-1.28), 1.22(1.12-1.33), and 1.31 (1.19-1.44), respectively. TyG-WC was nonlinearly linked to breast cancer (P for nonlinear = 0.006). Individuals with high genetic risk and high TyG related indicators exhibited a substantially elevated breast cancer risk by 4- to 5-fold compared with reference group. The associations were mainly mediated by SHBG, CRP, and testosterone, with mediation proportions ranging from 10.24% to 68.29%. TyG related factors are linked to incident postmenopausal breast cancer, and the combined effects with genetic risk significantly optimize risk stratification. High levels of TyG related indicators may amplify the influence of genetic factors on postmenopausal breast cancer.

"Intramuscular fat (IMF) is a key determinant of meat quality enhancement in pigs. However, its correlation with subcutaneous fat (SCF) deposition presents a challenge. The precise regulation of IMF lipogenesis, without impacting SCF deposition, is a critical issue in the pig industry. To investigate this, our study examined the lipid profiles of longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue in high IMF (IMFH) and low IMF (IMFL) Chinese Erhualian pigs using lipidomics techniques. We identified 112 differentially abundant lipids (DALs) in the muscle and 101 DALs in the adipose tissue. Notably, 105 specific DALs associated with IMF, including various candidate markers like upregulated lipids of PS (19:2/18:1), TG (14:2/4:0/4:0), PS (17:1/18:2), FA(10:0) + COOH:(s), CL (20:4/18:2/18:2/18:2), and downregulated lipids of FA (20:4), SM (d43:5), TG (38:1/22:6), PC (22:3/20:3), and PC (18:2/24:8), were identified. These specific DALs were implicated in the regulation of linoleic, arachidonic, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and choline metabolism in cancer. We further discovered that the lysophosphlipase 1 (LYPLA1) gene promotes differentiation and lipid deposition of intramuscular pre-adipocytes by affecting the phosphatidylcholine (PC) content.

"black seed (Nigella sativa L.) has long been utilized in traditional medicine and as a food ingredient due to its potential therapeutic properties including its effectiveness against cancer, coronaviruses, and bacterial infections. Recently, it has garnered significant attention for its rich reservoir of beneficial secondary metabolites. In vitro culture of black seeds presents an efficient and modern approach for the large-scale production of these valuable compounds, offering advantages such as space efficiency, reduced time, and lower costs. This study aimed to develop and optimize a protocol for callus induction and the identification of key secondary metabolites, including thymoquinone (TQ), phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. To induce callus formation in seed explants, two plant growth regulators (PGRs) were applied individually or in combination and incorporated into Murashige and Skoog (MS) culture medium. The combination of Auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), effectively induced callus formation in most explants, with the response varying based on concentration. The highest callus fresh weight (7.02 g) was obtained on Red(R) LED lighting with FeO<sub>3</sub>-CTs nanoparticles (100 mg/L<sup>- 1</sup>), which also resulted in the highest dry weight (1.307 g) after 40 days of cultivation. Similarly, the highest levels of phenols, flavonoids and amino acids were observed under R LED with FeO<sub>3</sub>-CTs nanoparticles (100 mg L<sup>- 1</sup>), while FeO<sub>3</sub>-CTs nanoparticles at 100 and 200 mg/L<sup>- 1</sup>) exhibited significant effects on metabolite production. In contrast, the antioxidant activity against DPPH free radicals and total carbohydrate accumulation were enhanced in callus cultures treated with FeO<sub>3</sub>-CTs nanoparticles (200 mg/L<sup>- 1</sup>) under dark conditions. Additionally, GC-MS analysis revealed that FeO<sub>3</sub>-CTs nanoparticles (100 mg/L<sup>- 1</sup>) yielded the most effective enhancement of secondary metabolites under blue (B) LED light at a concentration of 295 mg/L<sup>- 1</sup>. The finding of this study highlights the potential of the proposed method for the large-scale production of secondary metabolites, total carbohydrates, amino acids, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids from black seed callus cultures in a controlled environment.

"Tumor cells adapt to the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) and develop resistance to immunotherapy, with ferroptosis being a major form of tumor cell death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells coordinate TME stimuli and their unique metabolic traits to evade ferroptosis and develop resistance to immunotherapy remain unclear. Here we showed that interferon-γ (IFNγ)-activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylates phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) at serine 337 (S337), allowing it to interact with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and stabilize the protein, counteracting ferroptosis. PSAT1 elevates GPX4 stability by promoting α-ketoglutarate-dependent PHD3-mediated GPX4 proline 159 (P159) hydroxylation, disrupting its binding to HSC70 and inhibiting autophagy-mediated degradation. In mice, reconstitution of PSAT1 S337A or GPX4 P159A promotes ferroptosis and suppresses triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) progression. Blocking PSAT1 pS337 with CPP elevates IFNγ-induced ferroptosis and enhances the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies in TNBC. Additionally, PSAT1-mediated GPX4 hydroxylation correlates with poor immunotherapy outcomes in patients with TNBC, highlighting PSAT1's noncanonical role in suppressing ferroptosis and immunotherapy sensitivity.",Cancer Metabolism,tumor cells adapt inflammatory tumor microenvironment tme develop resistance immunotherapy ferroptosis major form tumor cell death however mechanisms tumor cells coordinate tme stimuli unique metabolic traits evade ferroptosis develop resistance immunotherapy remain unclear showed interferon ifnactivated calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase ii phosphorylates phosphoserine aminotransferase psat serine allowing interact glutathione peroxidase gpx stabilize protein counteracting ferroptosis psat elevates gpx stability promoting ketoglutaratedependent phdmediated gpx proline p hydroxylation disrupting binding hsc inhibiting autophagymediated degradation mice reconstitution psat sa gpx pa promotes ferroptosis suppresses triplenegative breast cancer tnbc progression blocking psat ps cpp elevates ifninduced ferroptosis enhances efficacy programmed cell death protein pd antibodies tnbc additionally psatmediated gpx hydroxylation correlates poor immunotherapy outcomes patients tnbc highlighting psats noncanonical role suppressing ferroptosis immunotherapy sensitivity,Cancer Metabolism

In this study, we synthesized a near-infrared fluorescent probe, NSSP, featuring a D-π-A structure, which facilitates the independent dual-response detection of HOCl and polarity. NSSP not only reveals the polarity and HOCl fluctuations in inflammatory cells and inflammation in live mice but also differentiates between normal and fatty liver tissues through two distinct channels. Furthermore, the probe has proven effective in identifying neoplasms within live murine models at both the cellular and systemic levels, thereby affirming its utility as an instrumental resource for the precocious detection of carcinomas.

"This study aimed to develop and evaluate [<sup>64</sup>Cu]Cu-PSMA-Q as a novel positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for prostate cancer detection, assessing its diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability in comparison to [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging. [<sup>64</sup>Cu]Cu-PSMA-Q was synthesized, purified, and subjected to comprehensive quality control. Its binding affinity, cellular uptake, and internalization were assessed in vitro using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive LNCaP C4-2B cells. In vivo toxicity studies were conducted in 12 mouse models (6 per group). Small-animal PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) imaging and biodistribution studies were performed on tumor-bearing mice. Clinical evaluation involved PET/CT imaging with [<sup>64</sup>Cu]Cu-PSMA-Q in 29 prostate cancer patients, with comparative analysis against [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT imaging. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM software, and diagnostic performance metrics, including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), and tumor-to-background ratio, were analyzed using SPSS v24.0, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Comparative analyses utilized t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate. [<sup>64</sup>Cu]Cu-PSMA-Q achieved over 99% radiochemical purity and a specific activity of 20.5 ± 1 GBq/μmol. In vitro studies demonstrated a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.083 nM, along with high cellular uptake and internalization in LNCaP C4-2B cells. No significant toxicity was observed in mouse models.

"The enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (EliSpot) assay and its fluorescence-based version, FluoroSpot, are sensitive immunoassays commonly used to quantify antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes and other immune cells in peripheral blood or homogenized tissues. Due to their high sensitivity, these assays are popular in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy and vaccines, which involve a high level of scrutiny to ensure valid study results. Besides industry consensus white papers and other research publications, there is no formal guidance for the industry on how to validate EliSpot and FluoroSpot assays to ensure their accurate performance for immune monitoring in clinical trials. Herein, we describe a comprehensive in vitro study using healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and model antigens to validate a double-color FluoroSpot assay for monitoring antigen-specific lymphocytes by detecting and quantifying IFN-γ and IL-2-producing lymphocytes. Validation parameters, acceptance criteria set-up, and assay limits-limit of detection (LOD), minimum positive control response, lower and upper limits of quantification (LLOQ and ULOQ)-were determined, and assay performance was demonstrated by assessing precision, specificity, linearity, and robustness. In addition, an inter-laboratory comparison demonstrated concordance between assay results from two laboratories. In summary, this study outlines a robust approach to EliSpot and FluoroSpot validation and demonstrates that the IFN-γ/IL-2 FluoroSpot assay is suitable for the reliable detection of antigen-specific immune responses from PBMC samples across laboratories and meets the current regulatory requirements for bioanalytical method validation.",Cancer Metabolism,enzymelinked immunosorbent spot elispot assay fluorescencebased version fluorospot sensitive immunoassays commonly used quantify antigenspecific b lymphocytes immune cells peripheral blood homogenized tissues due high sensitivity assays popular clinical trials evaluate efficacy immunotherapy vaccines involve high level scrutiny ensure valid study results besides industry consensus white papers research publications formal guidance industry validate elispot fluorospot assays ensure accurate performance immune monitoring clinical trials herein describe comprehensive vitro study using healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs model antigens validate doublecolor fluorospot assay monitoring antigenspecific lymphocytes detecting quantifying ifn ilproducing lymphocytes validation parameters acceptance criteria setup assay limitslimit detection lod minimum positive control response lower upper limits quantification lloq uloqwere determined assay performance demonstrated assessing precision specificity linearity robustness addition interlaboratory comparison demonstrated concordance assay results two laboratories summary study outlines robust approach elispot fluorospot validation demonstrates ifnil fluorospot assay suitable reliable detection antigenspecific immune responses pbmc samples across laboratories meets current regulatory requirements bioanalytical method validation,Cancer Metabolism
"Gastric cancer (GC) represents a substantial public health challenge, characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Migrasomes, a newly discovered type of extracellular vesicle, have been highlighted as important contributors to cancer progression, though their specific role in GC remains unclear. To address this issue, we developed the first prognostic model utilizing migrasome-related long non-coding RNAs (MRLs). This model aims to deepen the understanding of GC pathogenesis and improve patient outcomes. Clinical and transcriptional data for 407 GC patients from TCGA were classified as training and testing sets. Through Pearson correlation analysis, 537 MRLs were recognized, and LASSO and Cox regression analyses further refined the list to four key lncRNAs (AC012055.1, LINC01150, AC053503.4, AC107021.2) for constructing the prognostic model. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated a significantly poorer prognosis for the high-risk group. PCA confirmed the model's robustness, and univariate and multivariate analyses validated it as an independent predictor of clinical outcomes. The ROC curve and C-index evaluations further affirmed the model's predictive power. We developed a nomogram combining the MRLs signature with clinical parameters to enhance prognostic accuracy. GO, KEGG and GSEA were performed on migrasome-related genes associated with GC. Furthermore, high-risk patients exhibited increased immune cell infiltration and reduced tumor mutation burden, both associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, twenty-nine potential therapeutic agents were identified. This novel MRLs-based model provides crucial insights into GC biology and represents a valuable tool for improving patient management and therapeutic strategies.",Cancer Metabolism,gastric cancer gc represents substantial public health challenge characterized elevated morbidity mortality rates migrasomes newly discovered type extracellular vesicle highlighted important contributors cancer progression though specific role gc remains unclear address issue developed first prognostic model utilizing migrasomerelated long noncoding rnas mrls model aims deepen understanding gc pathogenesis improve patient outcomes clinical transcriptional data gc patients tcga classified training testing sets pearson correlation analysis mrls recognized lasso cox regression analyses refined list four key lncrnas ac linc ac ac constructing prognostic model kaplanmeier survival analysis indicated significantly poorer prognosis highrisk group pca confirmed models robustness univariate multivariate analyses validated independent predictor clinical outcomes roc curve cindex evaluations affirmed models predictive power developed nomogram combining mrls signature clinical parameters enhance prognostic accuracy go kegg gsea performed migrasomerelated genes associated gc furthermore highrisk patients exhibited increased immune cell infiltration reduced tumor mutation burden associated poorer outcomes additionally twentynine potential therapeutic agents identified novel mrlsbased model provides crucial insights gc biology represents valuable tool improving patient management therapeutic strategies,Cancer Metabolism
"Cells undergoing regulated necrosis systemically communicate with the immune system via the release of protein and non-protein secretomes. Ferroptosis is a recently described iron-dependent type of regulated necrosis driven by massive lipid peroxidation. While membrane rupture occurs during ferroptosis, a comprehensive appraisal of ferroptotic secretomes and their potential biological activity has been lacking. Here, we apply a multi-omics approach to provide an atlas of ferroptosis-induced secretomes and reveal a novel function in macrophage priming. Proteins with assigned DAMP and innate immune system function, such as MIF, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and chaperones, were released from ferroptotic cells. Non-protein secretomes with assigned inflammatory function contained oxylipins as well as TCA- and methionine-cycle metabolites. Interestingly, incubation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with ferroptotic supernatants induced transcriptional reprogramming consistent with priming. Indeed, exposure to ferroptotic supernatants enhanced LPS-induced cytokine production. These results define a catalog of ferroptosis-induced secretomes and identify a biological activity in macrophage priming with important implications for the fine-tuning of inflammatory processes.",Cancer Metabolism,cells undergoing regulated necrosis systemically communicate immune system via release protein nonprotein secretomes ferroptosis recently described irondependent type regulated necrosis driven massive lipid peroxidation membrane rupture occurs ferroptosis comprehensive appraisal ferroptotic secretomes potential biological activity lacking apply multiomics approach provide atlas ferroptosisinduced secretomes reveal novel function macrophage priming proteins assigned damp innate immune system function mif heat shock proteins hsps chaperones released ferroptotic cells nonprotein secretomes assigned inflammatory function contained oxylipins well tca methioninecycle metabolites interestingly incubation bone marrowderived macrophages bmdms ferroptotic supernatants induced transcriptional reprogramming consistent priming indeed exposure ferroptotic supernatants enhanced lpsinduced cytokine production results define catalog ferroptosisinduced secretomes identify biological activity macrophage priming important implications finetuning inflammatory processes,Cancer Metabolism
"Although macrophages and lipid metabolism significantly influence the progression of various cancers, their precise roles in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain unclear. This study focuses on identifying and validating biomarkers associated with macrophage-related genes (MRGs) and lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs), providing new targets and strategies for therapeutic intervention. This research utilized datasets from TCGA-PAAD, GSE62452, and GSE57495. Candidate genes were identified by overlapping differentially expressed genes with MRGs from WGCNA and LMRGs. Regression analyses were performed to pinpoint potential biomarkers and construct a risk model, which underwent evaluation. A nomogram was subsequently developed and validated. Additional analyses, including functional enrichment, somatic mutation profiling, immune landscape assessment, and RT-qPCR, were performed to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms in PC. The study identified ADH1A, ACACB, CD36, CERS4, PDE3B, ALOX5, and CRAT as biomarkers for PC. RT-qPCR results revealed reduced expression of ADH1A, ACACB, CD36, CERS4, PDE3B, and CRAT in tumor samples compared to adjacent tissues, whereas ALOX5 expression was significantly elevated in tumor samples. A risk model utilizing these biomarkers classified PC patients into high- and low-risk cohorts, with high-risk patients showing lower survival probabilities. Subsequently, risk score and N stage were identified as independent prognostic factors, leading to the development of a nomogram. Notably, both risk cohorts showed significant enrichment in the ""cell cycle"" pathway. Furthermore, TP53 mutations were prevalent in both high-risk (76%) and low-risk (50%) cohorts. Correlation analysis indicated that PVRL2 (an immunosuppressive factor), CD276 (an immunoactivator), and CCL20 (a chemotactic factor) had the highest positive correlation with the risk score. In this study, ADH1A, ACACB, CD36, CERS4, PDE3B, ALOX5, and CRAT were identified as biomarkers for PC, with their expression levels validated in clinical samples.

"Leucine rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) is recognized for its intimate association with the extracellular matrix, where it modulates fibroblast function and shapes the immune landscape within the tumour microenvironment. The specific expression patterns and molecular contributions of LRRC15 in triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to delineate the clinical relevance and biological implications of LRRC15 in TNBC, and to assess its potential as a novel therapeutic target for this disease. Our findings revealed robust overexpression of LRRC15 in TNBC tumour tissues and cell lines, which was inversely correlated with patient survival outcomes. Notably, the suppression of LRRC15 expression led to pronounced inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we established that LRRC15 interacts with Integrin Beta 1(ITGB1), facilitating the phosphorylation of the T788/T789 residues on ITGB1 and recruiting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to the site of integrin aggregation. This recruitment promotes the downstream phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, suggesting that LRRC15 is a key activator of the ITGB1/FAK/PI3K signalling pathway. Collectively, our data indicate that LRRC15 is a critical promoter of TNBC cell proliferation and metastasis through the activation of this signalling pathway, identifying LRRC15 as a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention in TNBC.",Cancer Metabolism,leucine rich repeat containing lrrc recognized intimate association extracellular matrix modulates fibroblast function shapes immune landscape within tumour microenvironment specific expression patterns molecular contributions lrrc triplenegative breast cancertnbc fully elucidated study aimed delineate clinical relevance biological implications lrrc tnbc assess potential novel therapeutic target disease findings revealed robust overexpression lrrc tnbc tumour tissues cell lines inversely correlated patient survival outcomes notably suppression lrrc expression led pronounced inhibition tnbc cell proliferation invasion migration vitro vivo mechanistically established lrrc interacts integrin beta itgb facilitating phosphorylation tt residues itgb recruiting focal adhesion kinase fak site integrin aggregation recruitment promotes downstream phosphorylation pik akt suggesting lrrc key activator itgbfakpik signalling pathway collectively data indicate lrrc critical promoter tnbc cell proliferation metastasis activation signalling pathway identifying lrrc promising candidate therapeutic intervention tnbc,Cancer Metabolism
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age. PCOS is associated with many chronic complications such as endometrial thickening, endometrial cancer, breast cancer, infertility, dyslipidemia, and long-term cardiovascular disease. Therefore, many parameters and markers should be used in the evaluation of patients diagnosed with PCOS. Calprotectin has also been shown to be an important marker of destruction in many diseases that progress with inflammatory processes. The objective of our study was to examine the diagnostic efficacy of calprotectin in the context of polycystic ovary syndrome. In this study, 39 patients diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and 41 healthy controls were analyzed. Serum calprotectin levels were compared between patients with different phenotypes of PCOS and a control group. Our study demonstrates significant differences in hormonal and inflammatory parameters between PCOS patients and healthy controls. PCOS patients exhibited significantly lower FSH levels and higher LH levels, resulting in a marked increase in the LH/FSH ratio. Additionally, DHEA-S and total testosterone levels were significantly elevated in the PCOS group, while SHBG levels were notably lower. The free androgen index (FAI) and serum calprotectin levels were also significantly higher in the PCOS group, highlighting the potential role of calprotectin in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Our study demonstrated that serum calprotectin levels are significantly higher in patients with PCOS compared to healthy controls. This finding underscores the potential role of calprotectin in the pathophysiology of PCOS and suggests that this marker could provide valuable insights into the inflammatory processes associated with the condition. However, further large-scale and long-term studies are necessary to better understand the impact of calprotectin on different PCOS phenotypes and its potential application in clinical practice.",Cancer Metabolism,polycystic ovary syndrome pcos one common endocrine disorders women reproductive age pcos associated many chronic complications endometrial thickening endometrial cancer breast cancer infertility dyslipidemia longterm cardiovascular disease therefore many parameters markers used evaluation patients diagnosed pcos calprotectin also shown important marker destruction many diseases progress inflammatory processes objective study examine diagnostic efficacy calprotectin context polycystic ovary syndrome study patients diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome healthy controls analyzed serum calprotectin levels compared patients different phenotypes pcos control group study demonstrates significant differences hormonal inflammatory parameters pcos patients healthy controls pcos patients exhibited significantly lower fsh levels higher lh levels resulting marked increase lhfsh ratio additionally dheas total testosterone levels significantly elevated pcos group shbg levels notably lower free androgen index fai serum calprotectin levels also significantly higher pcos group highlighting potential role calprotectin pathophysiology disorder study demonstrated serum calprotectin levels significantly higher patients pcos compared healthy controls finding underscores potential role calprotectin pathophysiology pcos suggests marker could provide valuable insights inflammatory processes associated condition however largescale longterm studies necessary better understand impact calprotectin different pcos phenotypes potential application clinical practice,Cancer Metabolism
"The influence of sex chromosomes and sex hormones on early human brain development is poorly understood. We therefore undertook transcriptomic analysis of 46,XY and 46,XX human brain cortex samples (n = 64) at four different time points between 7.5 and 17 weeks post conception (wpc), in two independent studies. This developmental period encompasses the onset of testicular testosterone secretion in the 46,XY fetus (8wpc). We show differences in sex chromosome gene expression including X-inactivation genes (XIST, TSIX) in 46,XX samples; core Y chromosome genes (n = 18) in 46,XY samples; and two Y chromosome brain specific genes, PCDH11Y and RP11-424G14.1. PCDH11Y (protocadherin11 Y-linked) regulates excitatory neurons; this gene is unique to humans and is implicated in language development. RP11-424G14.1 is a long non-coding RNA. Fewer differences in sex hormone pathway-related genes are seen. The androgen receptor (AR, NR3C4) shows cortex expression in both sexes, which decreases with age. Global cortical sex hormone effects are not seen, but more localized AR mechanisms may be important with time (e.g., hypothalamus). Taken together, our data suggest that limited but potentially important sex differences occur during early human fetal brain development.",Cancer Metabolism,influence sex chromosomes sex hormones early human brain development poorly understood therefore undertook transcriptomic analysis xy xx human brain cortex samples n four different time points weeks post conception wpc two independent studies developmental period encompasses onset testicular testosterone secretion xy fetus wpc show differences sex chromosome gene expression including xinactivation genes xist tsix xx samples core chromosome genes n xy samples two chromosome brain specific genes pcdhy rpg pcdhy protocadherin ylinked regulates excitatory neurons gene unique humans implicated language development rpg long noncoding rna fewer differences sex hormone pathwayrelated genes seen androgen receptor ar nrc shows cortex expression sexes decreases age global cortical sex hormone effects seen localized ar mechanisms may important time eg hypothalamus taken together data suggest limited potentially important sex differences occur early human fetal brain development,Cancer Metabolism
"The lung alveolus constitutes a morphologically and mechanistically complex tissue that is constantly subjected to cyclic tension and exhibits unique elastic properties. Available materials used to mimic alveolar tissue often lack biomimicry and the mechanical properties required for cyclic tension. Here, we report a fully synthetic fibrous polyurethane scaffold that approximates tissue stiffness, is elastic under breathing simulations and supports long-term culture of alveolar epithelial-like cells. Using electrospinning a fibrous membrane of tuneable thickness, set fibre diameter and small pore size is prepared. When subjected to cyclic uniaxial tension the material retains its elasticity at both low and high frequency mimicking human and mouse breathing. Thanks to the small pore size, lung alveolar cells can be cultured on its apical surface forming an epithelial monolayer. This monolayer can be maintained long term (at least 15 days) and in an air-liquid interface. In the latter conditions, cells differentiate and exhibit expression of surfactant protein A, a constituent of the surfactant layer that plays a key role in lung physiology. Owing to its lung-mimicking characteristics, the electrospun membrane holds the potential to be adapted for breathing lung models.",Cancer Metabolism,lung alveolus constitutes morphologically mechanistically complex tissue constantly subjected cyclic tension exhibits unique elastic properties available materials used mimic alveolar tissue often lack biomimicry mechanical properties required cyclic tension report fully synthetic fibrous polyurethane scaffold approximates tissue stiffness elastic breathing simulations supports longterm culture alveolar epitheliallike cells using electrospinning fibrous membrane tuneable thickness set fibre diameter small pore size prepared subjected cyclic uniaxial tension material retains elasticity low high frequency mimicking human mouse breathing thanks small pore size lung alveolar cells cultured apical surface forming epithelial monolayer monolayer maintained long term least days airliquid interface latter conditions cells differentiate exhibit expression surfactant protein constituent surfactant layer plays key role lung physiology owing lungmimicking characteristics electrospun membrane holds potential adapted breathing lung models,Cancer Metabolism
"Anti-HER2 antibodies are effective but often lead to resistance in patients with HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we report an epigenetic crosstalk with aberrant glycerophospholipid metabolism and inflammation as a key resistance mechanism of anti-HER2 therapies in HER2+ breast cancer. Histone reader ZMYND8 specifically confers resistance to cancer cells against trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab. Mechanistically, ZMYND8 enhances cPLA2α expression in resistant tumor cells through inducing c-Myc. cPLA2α inactivates phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C to inhibit phosphatidylcholine breakdown into diacylglycerol, which diminishes protein kinase C activity leading to interleukin-27 secretion. Supplementation with interleukin-27 protein counteracts cPLA2α loss to reinforce trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ tumor cells and patient-derived organoids. Upregulation of ZMYND8, c-Myc, cPLA2α, and IL-27 is prevalent in HER2+ breast cancer patients following HER2-targeted therapies. Targeting c-Myc or cPLA2α effectively overcomes anti-HER2 therapy resistance in patient-derived xenografts.

"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1) gene. Healthy individuals possess a repeat 30-55 CGG units in length. Once the CGG repeat exceeds 200 copies it triggers methylation at the locus. This methylation covers the FMR1 promoter region and silences expression of the gene and the production of FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). The loss of FMRP is responsible for a number of pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Methylation of the expanded repeat in the FMR1 locus is the causal factor for FXS, however it is not known why the expanded repeat triggers this epigenetic change or how exactly DNA methylation is established. Intriguingly, genetic engineering of expanded CGG repeats of over 300 copies in the FMR1 locus in mice remains unmethylated. Also in humans, in very rare cases, individuals can have an FMR1 CGG expansion > 200 copies but the locus remains unmethylated. These unmethylated full mutation (UFM) individuals give us a rare opportunity to investigate the mechanism of FMR1 promoter methylation. Fibroblasts were obtained from a healthy control, an FXS patient and two unmethylated full expansion carriers. RNA was extracted and comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed on all samples. Whole genome sequencing was carried out on DNA from the two UFM carriers and the results analysed to investigate DNA variants that could explain the observed differences in gene expression. Our analyses focused on genes involved in epigenetic modification. We show that Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), a gene involved in DNA methylation, is significantly downregulated in UFM carriers compared to healthy controls or FXS patient derived cells. Genomic analyses reveal a number of rare variants present in the TET3 locus in UFM carriers when compared to the reference genome. However, no clear modifying TET3 variants were identified. Our results suggest that TET3 is a candidate factor responsible for the lack of methylation of the expanded FMR1 locus. Further analyses are needed to further elucidate this relationship, however given its potential to directly interact with CGG repeats and its ambiguous role in 5-hydroxy-methylation of CG containing sequences, TET3 is a strong candidate for further exploration.",Neurogenomics,fragile x syndrome fxs neurodevelopmental disorder caused expansion cgg repeat utr fmr fragile x messenger ribonucleoprotein gene healthy individuals possess repeat cgg units length cgg repeat exceeds copies triggers methylation locus methylation covers fmr promoter region silences expression gene production fmrp fragile x messenger ribonucleoprotein loss fmrp responsible number pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay autism spectrum disorder methylation expanded repeat fmr locus causal factor fxs however known expanded repeat triggers epigenetic change exactly dna methylation established intriguingly genetic engineering expanded cgg repeats copies fmr locus mice remains unmethylated also humans rare cases individuals fmr cgg expansion copies locus remains unmethylated unmethylated full mutation ufm individuals give us rare opportunity investigate mechanism fmr promoter methylation fibroblasts obtained healthy control fxs patient two unmethylated full expansion carriers rna extracted comparative transcriptomic analysis performed samples whole genome sequencing carried dna two ufm carriers results analysed investigate dna variants could explain observed differences gene expression analyses focused genes involved epigenetic modification show tet methylcytosine dioxygenase tet gene involved dna methylation significantly downregulated ufm carriers compared healthy controls fxs patient derived cells genomic analyses reveal number rare variants present tet locus ufm carriers compared reference genome however clear modifying tet variants identified results suggest tet candidate factor responsible lack methylation expanded fmr locus analyses needed elucidate relationship however given potential directly interact cgg repeats ambiguous role hydroxymethylation cg containing sequences tet strong candidate exploration,Neurogenomics
"Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are typically known for mediating inhibitory synaptic transmission within the spinal cord and brainstem, but they also have key roles in embryonic brain development, learning/memory, inflammatory pain sensitization, and rhythmic breathing. GlyR dysfunction has been implicated in multiple neurological disease states, including startle disease (GlyR α1β) and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD) and epilepsy (GlyR α2). However, GlyRs do not operate in isolation but depend upon stable and transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that influence synaptic localization, homeostasis, signaling pathways, and receptor function. Despite the affinity purification of GlyRs using the antagonist strychnine over four decades ago, we still have much to learn about native GlyR stoichiometry and accessory proteins. In contrast to other neurotransmitter receptors, < 20 potential GlyR interactors have been identified to date. These include some well-known proteins that are vital to inhibitory synapse function, such as the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin and the RhoGEF collybistin. However, the majority of known interactors either bind to the GlyR α1 and β subunits, or the binding partner in the GlyR complex is unknown. Several potential GlyR interactors are not found at inhibitory synapses and/or have no clear functional role. Moreover, other GlyR interactors are secondary interactors that bind indirectly, for example, via gephyrin. In this review, we provide a critical evaluation of known GlyR interacting proteins and methodological limitations to date. We also provide a road map for the use of innovative and emerging interaction proteomic techniques that will unlock the GlyR interactome. With the emergence of disease-associated missense mutations in the α1, α2 and β subunit intracellular domains in startle disease and NDDs, understanding the identity and roles of GlyR accessory proteins is vital in understanding GlyR function and dysfunction in health and disease.",Neurogenomics,glycine receptors glyrs typically known mediating inhibitory synaptic transmission within spinal cord brainstem also key roles embryonic brain development learningmemory inflammatory pain sensitization rhythmic breathing glyr dysfunction implicated multiple neurological disease states including startle disease glyr neurodevelopmental disorders ndds including autism spectrum disorder asd intellectual disability id developmental delay dd epilepsy glyr however glyrs operate isolation depend upon stable transient proteinprotein interactions ppis influence synaptic localization homeostasis signaling pathways receptor function despite affinity purification glyrs using antagonist strychnine four decades ago still much learn native glyr stoichiometry accessory proteins contrast neurotransmitter receptors potential glyr interactors identified date include wellknown proteins vital inhibitory synapse function postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin rhogef collybistin however majority known interactors either bind glyr subunits binding partner glyr complex unknown several potential glyr interactors found inhibitory synapses andor clear functional role moreover glyr interactors secondary interactors bind indirectly example via gephyrin review provide critical evaluation known glyr interacting proteins methodological limitations date also provide road map use innovative emerging interaction proteomic techniques unlock glyr interactome emergence diseaseassociated missense mutations subunit intracellular domains startle disease ndds understanding identity roles glyr accessory proteins vital understanding glyr function dysfunction health disease,Neurogenomics
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a genetically complex neurodegenerative disorder. Up to 15% of cases are considered monogenic. However, research on monogenic PD has largely focused on populations of European ancestry, leaving gaps in our understanding of genetic variability in other populations. This study addresses this gap by analysing the allele frequencies of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in known monogenic PD genes across eight global populations, using data from the gnomAD database. We compiled a list of 27 genes associated with Mendelian PD from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, and identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants using ClinVar. We then performed pairwise comparisons of allele frequencies across populations included in the gnomAD database. Variants with significant frequency differences were further assessed using in silico pathogenicity predictions. We identified 81 variants across 17 genes with statistically significant allele frequency differences between at least two populations. Variants in <i>GBA1</i> were the most prevalent among monogenic PD-related genes, followed by <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>ATP13A2</i>, <i>VPS13C</i>, and <i>PRKN</i>. <i>GBA1</i> exhibited the greatest variability in allele frequencies, particularly the NM_000157.4:c.1226A>G (p.Asn409Ser) variant. Additionally, we observed significant population-specific differences in PD-related variants, such as the NM_032409.3:c.1040T>C (p.Leu347Pro) variant in <i>PINK1</i>, which was most prevalent in East Asian populations. Our findings reveal substantial population-specific differences in the allele frequencies of pathogenic variants linked to monogenic PD, emphasising the need for broader genetic studies beyond European populations.

"Defects of mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPase) represent an emerging, yet incompletely understood group of neurodevelopmental diseases with abnormal movements. The aim of this study was to redefine the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of movement disorders linked to the ATPase subunit-encoding genes ATP5F1A and ATP5F1B. We recruited regionally distant patients who had been genome or exome sequenced. Fibroblast cultures from two patients were established to perform RNA sequencing, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry-based high-throughput quantitative proteomics, and ATPase activity assays. In silico three-dimensional missense variant modeling was performed. We identified a patient with developmental delay, myoclonic dystonia, and spasticity who carried a heterozygous frameshift c.1404del (p.Glu469Serfs*3) variant in ATP5F1A. The patient's cells exhibited significant reductions in ATP5F1A mRNA, underexpression of the α-subunit of ATPase in association with other aberrantly expressed ATPase components, and compromised ATPase activity. In addition, a novel deleterious heterozygous ATP5F1A missense c.1252G>A (p.Gly418Arg) variant was discovered, shared by three patients from two families with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This variant mapped to a functionally important intersubunit communication site. A third heterozygous variant, c.1074+1G>T, affected a canonical donor splice site of ATP5F1B and resulted in exon skipping with significantly diminished ATP5F1B mRNA levels, as well as impaired ATPase activity. The associated phenotype consisted of cerebral palsy (CP) with prominent generalized dystonia. Our data confirm and expand the role of dominant ATP5F1A and ATP5F1B variants in neurodevelopmental movement disorders. ATP5F1A/ATP5F1B-related ATPase diseases should be considered as a cause of dystonia, HSP, and CP. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Leptin acts in the brain to suppress appetite, yet the responsible neurocircuitries underlying leptin's anorectic effect are incompletely defined. Prepronociceptin (PNOC)-expressing neurons mediate diet-induced hyperphagia and weight gain in mice. Here, we show that leptin regulates appetite and body weight via PNOC neurons, and that loss of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression in PNOC-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) causes hyperphagia and obesity. Restoring Lepr expression in PNOC neurons on a Lepr-null obese background substantially reduces body weight. Lepr inactivation in PNOC neurons increases neuropeptide Y (Npy) expression in a subset of hypothalamic PNOC neurons that do not express agouti-related peptide (Agrp). Selective chemogenetic activation of PNOC/NPY neurons promotes feeding to the same extent as activating all PNOC<sup>ARC</sup> neurons, and overexpression of Npy in PNOC<sup>ARC</sup> neurons promotes hyperphagia and obesity. Thus, we introduce PNOC/NPY<sup>ARC</sup> neurons as an additional critical mediator of leptin action and as a promising target for obesity therapeutics.",Neurogenomics,leptin acts brain suppress appetite yet responsible neurocircuitries underlying leptins anorectic effect incompletely defined prepronociceptin pnocexpressing neurons mediate dietinduced hyperphagia weight gain mice show leptin regulates appetite body weight via pnoc neurons loss leptin receptor lepr expression pnocexpressing neurons arcuate nucleus hypothalamus arc causes hyperphagia obesity restoring lepr expression pnoc neurons leprnull obese background substantially reduces body weight lepr inactivation pnoc neurons increases neuropeptide npy expression subset hypothalamic pnoc neurons express agoutirelated peptide agrp selective chemogenetic activation pnocnpy neurons promotes feeding extent activating pnocsuparcsup neurons overexpression npy pnocsuparcsup neurons promotes hyperphagia obesity thus introduce pnocnpysuparcsup neurons additional critical mediator leptin action promising target obesity therapeutics,Neurogenomics
"Between 22 and 45 % of children born preterm experience difficulties with expressive and receptive language when they reach school age. Little is currently known about the neural mechanisms behind their linguistic performance. This study investigates the brain areas and white matter connections that form the structural language network in extremely preterm-born children who have reached school age. Structural brain connectivity was quantified using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography in n = 58 (62 % female) extremely preterm-born children aged 8-12 years. Language outcomes were assessed using the CELF-4-NL Recalling Sentences subtest. Language scores were below average in n = 13 (22 %) children. Language outcomes related significantly to a subnetwork of 16 brain regions (p = 0.012). The network comprised brain regions from the left hemisphere including the pars orbitalis, middle and superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, pre- and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, insula, caudate nucleus, thalamus, and putamen. In the right hemisphere, the anterior cingulate was part of the network. These findings suggest that extremely preterm children rely mostly on their left hemisphere during language processing, which is similar to typically developing children. However, they seem to use compensatory neural pathways that include brain areas right next to the areas typically involved in language processing. These areas include the pars orbitalis (adjacent to Broca's area) and the putamen and caudate nucleus (adjacent to the limbic system). It is important to note that language difficulties were not necessarily related to brain injury around birth.",Neurogenomics,children born preterm experience difficulties expressive receptive language reach school age little currently known neural mechanisms behind linguistic performance study investigates brain areas white matter connections form structural language network extremely pretermborn children reached school age structural brain connectivity quantified using diffusionweighted imaging dwi tractography n female extremely pretermborn children aged years language outcomes assessed using celfnl recalling sentences subtest language scores average n children language outcomes related significantly subnetwork brain regions p network comprised brain regions left hemisphere including pars orbitalis middle superior frontal gyrus frontal pole pre postcentral gyrus superior temporal gyrus insula caudate nucleus thalamus putamen right hemisphere anterior cingulate part network findings suggest extremely preterm children rely mostly left hemisphere language processing similar typically developing children however seem use compensatory neural pathways include brain areas right next areas typically involved language processing areas include pars orbitalis adjacent brocas area putamen caudate nucleus adjacent limbic system important note language difficulties necessarily related brain injury around birth,Neurogenomics
"Long-read sequencing methodologies provide powerful capacity to identify all types of genomic variations in a single test. Long-read platforms such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio have the potential to revolutionize molecular diagnostics by reaching unparalleled accuracies in genetic discovery and long-range phasing. In the field of dystonia, promising results have come from recent pilot studies showing improved detection of disease-causing structural variants and repeat expansions. Increases in throughput and ongoing reductions in cost will facilitate the incorporation of long-read approaches into mainstream diagnostic practice. Although these developments are likely to transform clinical care, there is currently a discrepancy between the potential benefits of long-read sequencing and the application of this technique to dystonia. In this review we highlight current opportunities and limitations of adopting long-read sequencing methods for the investigation of patients with dystonia. We provide examples of long-read sequencing integration into diagnostic evaluation and the study of pathomechanisms in individuals with dystonic disorders. The goal of this article is to stimulate research into the application and optimization of long-read analysis strategies in dystonia, thus enabling more precise understanding of the underlying etiology in the future. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Early-onset SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy is caused by SCN2A gain-of-function variants. Here we describe the clinical experience with intrathecally administered elsunersen, a gapmer antisense oligonucleotide targeting SCN2A, in a female preterm infant with early-onset SCN2A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, in an expanded access program. Before elsunersen treatement, the patient was in status epilepticus for 7 weeks with a seizure frequency of 20-25 per hour. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed impaired channel inactivation and increased persistent current consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Elsunersen treatment demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no severe or serious adverse events reported after 19 intrathecal administrations over 20 months. After administration in combination with sodium channel blockers, status epilepticus was interrupted intermittently and ultimately ceased after continued dosing. A >60% reduction in seizure frequency corresponding to five to seven seizures per hour was observed, which has been sustained during follow-up until the age of 22 months. These data provide preliminary insights on the safety and efficacy of elsunersen in a preterm infant.

"Sleep plays a crucial role in emotion regulation. Disturbed sleep is therefore increasingly seen as a potential causal factor for the development and maintenance of affective psychiatric disorders. This may hold especially for borderline personality disorder (BPD), a core emotion dysregulation disorder. Although BPD is strongly associated with sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nightmares and circadian dysrhythmia, research into the role of sleep in BPD remains sparse. In this narrative review, we outline a putative vicious cycle of reciprocal exacerbation of disturbed sleep and emotion dysregulation in BPD, that sheds light on BPD pathophysiology and opens up new avenues for sleep-based treatments. We discuss emotional dysregulation as the base of BPD as well as the observed sleep disturbances in BPD. Based on existing theories of sleep's role in emotion regulation and memory, we then propose several behavioral and neurobiological pathways by which inherent sleep disturbances in BPD may hamper adaptive overnight emotional processing. This likely results in sustained emotional states and associated sleep-disruptive behavior, which in turn negatively impact sleep. We end by proposing a sleep-based research agenda for BPD to further detail the causative role of disturbed sleep in BPD and test the effectiveness of novel sleep-based treatment strategies.",Neurogenomics,sleep plays crucial role emotion regulation disturbed sleep therefore increasingly seen potential causal factor development maintenance affective psychiatric disorders may hold especially borderline personality disorder bpd core emotion dysregulation disorder although bpd strongly associated sleep disturbances insomnia nightmares circadian dysrhythmia research role sleep bpd remains sparse narrative review outline putative vicious cycle reciprocal exacerbation disturbed sleep emotion dysregulation bpd sheds light bpd pathophysiology opens new avenues sleepbased treatments discuss emotional dysregulation base bpd well observed sleep disturbances bpd based existing theories sleeps role emotion regulation memory propose several behavioral neurobiological pathways inherent sleep disturbances bpd may hamper adaptive overnight emotional processing likely results sustained emotional states associated sleepdisruptive behavior turn negatively impact sleep end proposing sleepbased research agenda bpd detail causative role disturbed sleep bpd test effectiveness novel sleepbased treatment strategies,Neurogenomics
"Synaptic dysfunction is a common feature across a broad spectrum of brain diseases, spanning from psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUD) to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD). While neuroscience research aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying synaptic dysfunction has traditionally focused on the neuronal elements of the synapse, recent research increasingly acknowledges the contribution of astrocytes as a third element controlling synaptic transmission. This also sparked interest to investigate the tripartite synapse and its role in the etiology of neurological diseases. According to recent evidence, changes in the structural interaction between astrocytes and synapses not only play a pivotal role in modulating synaptic function and behavioral states, but are also implicated in the initiation and progression of various brain diseases. This review aims to integrate recent findings that provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning astrocytic structural changes at the synapse. We offer a comprehensive discussion of the potential implications of compromised astrocyte-synapse interactions, and put forward that astrocytic synaptic coverage is generally reduced in numerous neurological disorders, with the extent of it being disease- and stage- specific. Finally, we propose outstanding questions on astrocyte-synapse structural plasticity that are relevant for future therapeutic strategies to tackle neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.",Neurogenomics,synaptic dysfunction common feature across broad spectrum brain diseases spanning psychopathologies posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd substance use disorders sud neurodegenerative diseases like alzheimers parkinsons disease ad pd neuroscience research aiming understand mechanisms underlying synaptic dysfunction traditionally focused neuronal elements synapse recent research increasingly acknowledges contribution astrocytes third element controlling synaptic transmission also sparked interest investigate tripartite synapse role etiology neurological diseases according recent evidence changes structural interaction astrocytes synapses play pivotal role modulating synaptic function behavioral states also implicated initiation progression various brain diseases review aims integrate recent findings provide insight molecular mechanisms underpinning astrocytic structural changes synapse offer comprehensive discussion potential implications compromised astrocytesynapse interactions put forward astrocytic synaptic coverage generally reduced numerous neurological disorders extent disease stage specific finally propose outstanding questions astrocytesynapse structural plasticity relevant future therapeutic strategies tackle neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric diseases,Neurogenomics
"Investigating dynamic changes during normal brain development is essential for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and assessing the impact of novel therapies for these conditions. Rodent models, with their shorter developmental timeline, offer a valuable alternative to humans. This study aimed to characterise brain maturation in mice using a longitudinal, multimodal imaging approach. We conducted an in vivo imaging study on 31129/Sv mice with a complete longitudinal dataset available for 22 mice. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET were used to examine the development of brain functional connectivity (FC), white matter integrity, and synaptic density at three developmental stages: infancy (P14-21), juvenile (P32-42), and adulthood (P87-106). From infancy to juvenile age, we observed a significant decrease in FC and synaptic density, alongside increases in fractional anisotropy (FA) and decreases in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (RD). From juvenile to adult age, synaptic density and FC stabilised, while FA further increased, and RD continued to decrease. The default mode like network was identifiable in mice across all developmental stages. Our findings mirror established patterns of human brain development, with infant mice allowing us to capture critical brain developmental changes, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings. This study provides a robust framework for normal rodent neurodevelopment and establishes a foundation for future research on NDDs in mice and the impact of novel treatments on neurodevelopment.

"Opioid use disorder (OUD) causes major public health morbidity and mortality. Although standard-of-care treatment with medications for OUD (MOUDs) is available, there are few biological markers of the clinical process of recovery. Neurobiological aspects of recovery can include normalization of brain white matter (WM) microstructure, which is sensitive to cytokine signaling. Here, we determined whether blood-based cytokines can be markers of change in WM microstructure following MOUD. Inpatient individuals with heroin use disorder (iHUDs) (<i>n</i> = 21) with methadone or buprenorphine MOUD underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and provided ratings of drug cue-induced craving, arousal, and valence earlier in treatment (MRI1) and ≈14 weeks thereafter (MRI2). Healthy control participants (HCs) (<i>n</i> = 24) also underwent 2 MRI scans during a similar time interval. At MRI2, participants provided a peripheral blood sample for multiplex quantification of serum cytokines. We analyzed the correlation of a multitarget biomarker score (from a principal component analysis of 19 cytokines that differed significantly between iHUDs and HCs) with treatment-related change in DTI metrics (ΔDTI; MRI2 - MRI1). The cytokine biomarker score was negatively correlated with ΔDTI metrics in frontal, frontoparietal, and corticolimbic WM tracts in iHUDs but not in HCs. Also, serum levels of specific cytokines in the cytokine biomarker score, including the interleukin-related oncostatin M (OSM), similarly correlated with ΔDTI metrics in iHUDs but not in HCs. Serum levels of other specific cytokines were negatively correlated with changes in cue-induced craving and arousal in the iHUDs. Specific serum cytokines, studied alone or as a group, may serve as accessible biomarkers of WM microstructure changes and potential recovery in iHUDs undergoing treatment with MOUD.",Neurogenomics,opioid use disorder oud causes major public health morbidity mortality although standardofcare treatment medications oud mouds available biological markers clinical process recovery neurobiological aspects recovery include normalization brain white matter wm microstructure sensitive cytokine signaling determined whether bloodbased cytokines markers change wm microstructure following moud inpatient individuals heroin use disorder ihuds ini methadone buprenorphine moud underwent magnetic resonance imaging mri scans diffusion tensor imaging dti provided ratings drug cueinduced craving arousal valence earlier treatment mri weeks thereafter mri healthy control participants hcs ini also underwent mri scans similar time interval mri participants provided peripheral blood sample multiplex quantification serum cytokines analyzed correlation multitarget biomarker score principal component analysis cytokines differed significantly ihuds hcs treatmentrelated change dti metrics dti mri mri cytokine biomarker score negatively correlated dti metrics frontal frontoparietal corticolimbic wm tracts ihuds hcs also serum levels specific cytokines cytokine biomarker score including interleukinrelated oncostatin osm similarly correlated dti metrics ihuds hcs serum levels specific cytokines negatively correlated changes cueinduced craving arousal ihuds specific serum cytokines studied alone group may serve accessible biomarkers wm microstructure changes potential recovery ihuds undergoing treatment moud,Neurogenomics
"Occupational cancer and acute cardiac events are the leading causes of death among firefighters. Increased exposure to toxicants on the fire ground, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, benzene, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has been linked to certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, accelerated epigenetic aging, and other adverse health effects. PFAS are a major concern because they are persistent, can bioaccumulate, and are present in several firefighting tools. Compared to the general population, firefighters have elevated serum levels of some types of PFAS. A randomized clinical trial in Australian firefighters found that routine blood and plasma donation for 1 year led to decreased serum PFAS levels, although health outcomes were not directly measured in that study. In collaboration with fire service leadership in Arizona, the Firefighter Collaborative Research Project (FCRP) was established to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 interventions in a randomized controlled trial design to reduce serum PFAS levels, reduce cancer and cardiovascular risk, and improve overall health and wellness in US firefighters. This study aimed to recruit and enroll up to 1500 active firefighters between August 2023 and October 2024. Between August 2023 and October 2024, active firefighters were recruited and randomized into a study arm based on their eligibility, including serum PFOS levels, for the specific arms. The trial arms include (1) blood and plasma donation, (2) zone 2 physical activity, and (3) intermittent fasting. FCRP outcomes include serum PFAS reduction (arm 1), epigenetic age acceleration (all arms), cardiovascular conditioning (arm 2) and cognitive outcomes (all arms), mental health (all arms), and overall disease risk (all arms). Each study arm includes an intervention and a control group. At enrollment and end of the study, participants provide blood and urine samples and complete a comprehensive questionnaire on their occupational and health history, exposures, and lifestyle behaviors. At the end of the study, participants also participated in a cognitive evaluation. Depending on the study arm, participants may additionally complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline and follow-up, a mid-study survey, and a mid-study blood and urine collection. Participant activities and data collection will conclude by December 2025. The FCRP is a randomized controlled trial that aims to test the effectiveness of fire service-selected interventions in reducing serum PFAS levels. Study results will contribute to potential interventions that could be used to reduce serum PFAS levels in firefighters. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05869747; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05869747.

"Cardiac desmosomes are specialized cell junctions responsible for cardiomyocytes mechanical coupling. Mutation in desmosomal genes cause autosomal dominant and recessive familial arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Motivated by evidence that Mendelian diseases share genetic architecture with common complex traits, we assessed whether common variants in any desmosomal gene were associated with cardiac conduction traits in the general population. We analysed data of N=4342 Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study participants. We tested associations between genotype imputed variants covering the five desmosomal genes <i>DSP, JUP, PKP2, DSG2,</i> and <i>DSC2,</i> and P-wave, PR, QRS, and QT electrocardiographic intervals, using linear mixed models. Functional annotation and interrogation of publicly available genome-wide association study resources implicated potential connection with antisense lncRNAs, DNA methylation sites, and complex traits. Causality was tested via two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and validated with functional <i>in vitro</i> follow-up in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). <i>DSP</i> variant rs2744389 was associated with QRS (<i>P</i>=3.5×10<sup>-6</sup>), with replication in the Microisolates in South Tyrol (MICROS) study (n=636; <i>P</i>=0.010). Observing that rs2744389 was associated with <i>DSP-AS1</i> antisense lncRNA but not with <i>DSP</i> expression in multiple GTEx-v8 tissues, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses that identified causal effects of <i>DSP-AS1</i> on <i>DSP</i> expression (<i>P</i>=6.33×10<sup>-5</sup>; colocalization posterior probability=0.91) and QRS (<i>P</i>=0.015). In hiPSC-CMs, <i>DSP-AS1</i> expression downregulation through a specific GapmerR matching sequence led to significant <i>DSP</i> upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels.

"The acute and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been of great clinical interest since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a high prevalence of individuals with persistent symptoms, a wholistic view of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on special sensory systems is lacking. Considering the significant impact of normal sensory function on quality of life, the goal of this review is to highlight unresolved issues related to SARS-CoV-2-associated insults to the sensory nervous system. In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2-induced sensory perturbations, underlying pathological mechanisms, and possible therapeutic strategies across the olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, visual, and auditory systems. Examined literature included studies with human biospecimens, human-derived cell lines, and naturally susceptible animal models, which highlighted evidence of persistent functional disruption in all sensory systems. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with persistent inflammation in the olfactory epithelium/bulb, somatosensory ganglia, and gustatory systems, long-term transcriptional perturbations in the sensory central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, and detectable degeneration/apoptosis in the gustatory and visual systems. Few studies have proposed evidence-based therapeutic strategies for attenuating specific sensory abnormalities after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the olfactory system, and to some extent the visual and somatosensory systems, have been more thoroughly investigated from symptomatology, behavioral and molecular perspectives, there is still an unmet need for the development of therapeutics to treat COVID-induced impairment of these systems. Further, additional attention must be placed on COVID-associated impairment of the gustatory, visual, and auditory systems, which lack detailed mechanistic investigations into their pathogenesis.",Neurogenomics,acute postacute sequelae sarscov infection great clinical interest since inception covid pandemic despite high prevalence individuals persistent symptoms wholistic view effects sarscov special sensory systems lacking considering significant impact normal sensory function quality life goal review highlight unresolved issues related sarscovassociated insults sensory nervous system narrative review discuss epidemiology sarscovinduced sensory perturbations underlying pathological mechanisms possible therapeutic strategies across olfactory gustatory somatosensory visual auditory systems examined literature included studies human biospecimens humanderived cell lines naturally susceptible animal models highlighted evidence persistent functional disruption sensory systems sarscov infection associated persistent inflammation olfactory epitheliumbulb somatosensory ganglia gustatory systems longterm transcriptional perturbations sensory central nervous system peripheral nervous system detectable degenerationapoptosis gustatory visual systems studies proposed evidencebased therapeutic strategies attenuating specific sensory abnormalities sarscov infection olfactory system extent visual somatosensory systems thoroughly investigated symptomatology behavioral molecular perspectives still unmet need development therapeutics treat covidinduced impairment systems additional attention must placed covidassociated impairment gustatory visual auditory systems lack detailed mechanistic investigations pathogenesis,Neurogenomics
"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may help inform the etiology of infertility. Here, we perform GWAS meta-analyses across seven cohorts in up to 42,629 cases and 740,619 controls and identify 25 genetic risk loci for male and female infertility. We additionally identify up to 269 genetic loci associated with follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and testosterone through sex-specific GWAS meta-analyses (n = 6,095-246,862). Exome sequencing analyses reveal that women carrying testosterone-lowering rare variants in some genes are at risk of infertility. However, we find no local or genome-wide genetic correlation between female infertility and reproductive hormones. While infertility is genetically correlated with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, we find limited genetic overlap between infertility and obesity. Finally, we show that the evolutionary persistence of infertility-risk alleles may be explained by directional selection. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive view of the genetic determinants of infertility across multiple diagnostic criteria.",Neurogenomics,genomewide association studies gwass may help inform etiology infertility perform gwas metaanalyses across seven cohorts cases controls identify genetic risk loci male female infertility additionally identify genetic loci associated folliclestimulating hormone luteinizing hormone estradiol testosterone sexspecific gwas metaanalyses n exome sequencing analyses reveal women carrying testosteronelowering rare variants genes risk infertility however find local genomewide genetic correlation female infertility reproductive hormones infertility genetically correlated endometriosis polycystic ovary syndrome find limited genetic overlap infertility obesity finally show evolutionary persistence infertilityrisk alleles may explained directional selection taken together provide comprehensive view genetic determinants infertility across multiple diagnostic criteria,Neurogenomics
"Intellectual disability is a neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting 2%-3% of the population, with a genetic cause in the majority of cases. <i>ATP9A</i> (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)⁣<sup>∗</sup>609126, NM_006045.3) has recently been added to the list of candidate genes involved in this disorder with the identification of biallelic truncating variants in patients with a neurodevelopmental disorder. In this study, we propose a novel mode of inheritance for <i>ATP9A</i>-related disorders with the identification of five de novo heterozygous missense variants (p.(Thr393Arg), p.(Glu400Gln), p.(Lys461Glu), p.(Gly552Ala), and p.(His713Asp)), in patients with intellectual disability. In a patient with a similar phenotype, we also identified two truncating variants in <i>ATP9A</i> (p.(Arg145⁣<sup>∗</sup>), p.(Glu901⁣<sup>∗</sup>)), adding a novel family to the six already described in the literature with the recessive mode of inheritance. Functional studies were performed to assess the pathogenicity of these variants. Overexpression of four selected missense mutant forms of <i>Atp9a</i> in HeLa cells and in primary neuronal cultures led to a loss of mature dendritic spines. In HeLa cells, the endosomal localization of the protein encoded by three of these missense variants was preserved whereas the fourth remained blocked in the endoplasmic reticulum. To mimic the effect on neuronal morphology and spine density of nonsense variants, small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were used.

"Currently, there is only limited data on monogenic causes of vertebral defects, anorectal malformations, cardiac defects, esophageal atresia or tracheoesophageal fistula, renal malformations, and limb defects (VACTERL) association. The aim of this study was to extend the spectrum of disease-causing variants in known genes, to determine the diagnostic yield of monogenic causes, and to identify candidate genes and rare variants by applying comprehensive genetic testing or rare variant burden. The total cohort comprised 101 affected individuals and their parents. Trio exome sequencing was only performed in 96 individuals and their parents because of DNA quality reasons and case-control gene and pathway burden tests were calculated and evaluated by quantile-quantile plots, principal component analysis plots and family-based association test (FBAT). In 5 of 96 individuals, disease-causing variants in known genes or loci were identified to be associated with the following 4 disorders: Kabuki syndrome, Sotos syndrome, MELAS syndrome, and deletion syndrome encompassing <i>TWIST1</i>. In 91 individuals, no disease-causing variants were found. FBAT showed 14 significant variants, 2 significant genes (<i>LOC645752</i> and <i>ZNF417</i>), and 8 significant pathways.

"The co-occurrence of insulin resistance (IR)-related metabolic conditions with neuropsychiatric disorders is a major public health challenge. Evidence of the genetic links between these phenotypes is emerging, but little is currently known about the genomic regions and biological functions that are involved. To address this, we performed Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association (LAVA) using large-scale (N = 9,725-933,970) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) results for three IR-related conditions (type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome) and nine neuropsychiatric disorders. Subsequently, positional and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-based gene mapping and downstream functional genomic analyses were performed on the significant loci. Patterns of negative and positive local genetic correlations (|r<sub>g</sub>| = 0.21-1, p<sub>FDR</sub> < 0.05) were identified at 109 unique genomic regions across all phenotype pairs. Local correlations emerged even in the absence of global genetic correlations between IR-related conditions and Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Genes mapped to the correlated regions showed enrichment in biological pathways integral to immune-inflammatory function, vesicle trafficking, insulin signalling, oxygen transport, and lipid metabolism. Colocalisation analyses further prioritised 10 genetically correlated regions for likely harbouring shared causal variants, displaying high deleterious or regulatory potential. These variants were found within or in close proximity to genes, such as SLC39A8 and HLA-DRB1, that can be targeted by supplements and already known drugs, including omega-3/6 fatty acids, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Overall, our findings highlight the complex genetic architecture of IR-neuropsychiatric multimorbidity, advocating for an integrated disease model and offering novel insights for research and treatment strategies in this domain.",Neurogenomics,cooccurrence insulin resistance irrelated metabolic conditions neuropsychiatric disorders major public health challenge evidence genetic links phenotypes emerging little currently known genomic regions biological functions involved address performed local analysis covariant association lava using largescale n genomewide association studies gwass results three irrelated conditions type diabetes mellitus obesity metabolic syndrome nine neuropsychiatric disorders subsequently positional expression quantitative trait locus eqtlbased gene mapping downstream functional genomic analyses performed significant loci patterns negative positive local genetic correlations rsubgsub psubfdrsub identified unique genomic regions across phenotype pairs local correlations emerged even absence global genetic correlations irrelated conditions alzheimers disease bipolar disorder tourettes syndrome genes mapped correlated regions showed enrichment biological pathways integral immuneinflammatory function vesicle trafficking insulin signalling oxygen transport lipid metabolism colocalisation analyses prioritised genetically correlated regions likely harbouring shared causal variants displaying high deleterious regulatory potential variants found within close proximity genes slca hladrb targeted supplements already known drugs including omega fatty acids immunomodulatory antihypertensive cholesterollowering drugs overall findings highlight complex genetic architecture irneuropsychiatric multimorbidity advocating integrated disease model offering novel insights research treatment strategies domain,Neurogenomics
"The leukodystrophy vanishing white matter (VWM) most often has its onset in childhood and is characterized by chronic decline and additionally stress-provoked acute neurological deterioration. Anesthesia is a stressor that can trigger this acute decline. The commonly used inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane has been reported to activate the integrated stress response (ISR), whereas the intravenous anesthetic propofol has not. We aimed to assess the differential effects of these anesthetics in models of VWM. We investigated the molecular effects of sevoflurane and propofol on the ISR in a murine neural cell line and in cultured astrocytes from patients with VWM and control subjects with immunostainings for prototypic ISR marker activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). We determined the effects of these anesthetics on clinical signs and expression of ISR mRNAs in VWM and wild-type mice. In the murine cell line, sevoflurane increased ATF4 accumulation compared with its vehicle (+157%); in contrast, propofol's vehicle without (-22%) and with (-23%) propofol decreased tunicamycin-increased levels of ATF4 to similar degree. Sevoflurane activated the ISR in astrocytes from control subjects (+17-33%) but not from patients with VWM (+1-2%). Propofol and its vehicle did not impact the ISR in astrocytes. The anesthetics did not have prolonged effects on motor skills in VWM mice but had small differential effects on ISR mRNA levels, consistently higher with sevoflurane than with propofol. We observed differential effects of the anesthetics in cultured neural cells and on expression levels of ISR markers in VWM mice, but not on clinical signs in VWM mice.",Neurogenomics,leukodystrophy vanishing white matter vwm often onset childhood characterized chronic decline additionally stressprovoked acute neurological deterioration anesthesia stressor trigger acute decline commonly used inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane reported activate integrated stress response isr whereas intravenous anesthetic propofol aimed assess differential effects anesthetics models vwm investigated molecular effects sevoflurane propofol isr murine neural cell line cultured astrocytes patients vwm control subjects immunostainings prototypic isr marker activating transcription factor atf determined effects anesthetics clinical signs expression isr mrnas vwm wildtype mice murine cell line sevoflurane increased atf accumulation compared vehicle contrast propofols vehicle without propofol decreased tunicamycinincreased levels atf similar degree sevoflurane activated isr astrocytes control subjects patients vwm propofol vehicle impact isr astrocytes anesthetics prolonged effects motor skills vwm mice small differential effects isr mrna levels consistently higher sevoflurane propofol observed differential effects anesthetics cultured neural cells expression levels isr markers vwm mice clinical signs vwm mice,Neurogenomics
"β-synuclein is a promising blood marker to track synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but changes in preclinical AD are unclear. We investigated serum β-synuclein in 69 cognitively unimpaired mutation non-carriers, 78 cognitively unimpaired AD mutation carriers (asymptomatic AD), and 31 symptomatic mutation carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. β-synuclein levels were already higher in asymptomatic AD mutation carriers compared to non-carriers and highest in symptomatic carriers. Longitudinal trajectories and correlation analyses indicated that β-synuclein levels start to rise after amyloid deposition preceding axonal degeneration, brain atrophy and hypometabolism, and cognitive decline. β-synuclein levels were associated with cognitive impairment and gradually increased with declining cognition. Our study supports the use of blood β-synuclein to track synaptic changes in preclinical AD and as a surrogate marker for cognitive impairment which might be used in early diagnosis and to support patient selection and monitoring of treatment effects in clinical trials. Blood β-synuclein levels were already higher in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutation carriers. Blood β-synuclein levels were highest in symptomatic AD mutation carriers.

"Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain and have pivotal roles in neurodevelopment and neuroinflammation<sup>1,2</sup>. This study investigates the function of the immune-checkpoint molecule TIM-3 (encoded by HAVCR2) in microglia. TIM-3 was recently identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease<sup>3</sup>, and it can induce T cell exhaustion<sup>4</sup>. However, its specific function in brain microglia remains unclear. We demonstrate in mouse models that TGFβ signalling induces TIM-3 expression in microglia. In turn, TIM-3 interacts with SMAD2 and TGFBR2 through its carboxy-terminal tail, which enhances TGFβ signalling by promoting TGFBR-mediated SMAD2 phosphorylation, and this process maintains microglial homeostasis. Genetic deletion of Havcr2 in microglia leads to increased phagocytic activity and a gene-expression profile consistent with the neurodegenerative microglial phenotype (MGnD), also referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM). Furthermore, microglia-targeted deletion of Havcr2 ameliorates cognitive impairment and reduces amyloid-β pathology in 5×FAD mice (a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease). Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a subpopulation of MGnD microglia in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice characterized by increased pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory gene expression alongside reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression. These transcriptomic changes were corroborated by single-cell RNA sequencing data across most microglial clusters in Havcr2-deficient 5×FAD mice. Our findings reveal that TIM-3 mediates microglia homeostasis through TGFβ signalling and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial TIM-3 in Alzheimer's disease.",Neurogenomics,microglia resident immune cells brain pivotal roles neurodevelopment neuroinflammationsupsup study investigates function immunecheckpoint molecule tim encoded havcr microglia tim recently identified genetic risk factor lateonset alzheimers diseasesupsup induce cell exhaustionsupsup however specific function brain microglia remains unclear demonstrate mouse models tgf signalling induces tim expression microglia turn tim interacts smad tgfbr carboxyterminal tail enhances tgf signalling promoting tgfbrmediated smad phosphorylation process maintains microglial homeostasis genetic deletion havcr microglia leads increased phagocytic activity geneexpression profile consistent neurodegenerative microglial phenotype mgnd also referred diseaseassociated microglia dam furthermore microgliatargeted deletion havcr ameliorates cognitive impairment reduces amyloid pathology fad mice transgenic model alzheimers disease singlenucleus rna sequencing revealed subpopulation mgnd microglia havcrdeficient fad mice characterized increased prophagocytic antiinflammatory gene expression alongside reduced proinflammatory gene expression transcriptomic changes corroborated singlecell rna sequencing data across microglial clusters havcrdeficient fad mice findings reveal tim mediates microglia homeostasis tgf signalling highlight therapeutic potential targeting microglial tim alzheimers disease,Neurogenomics
"To date, various epigenetic clocks have been constructed to estimate biological age, most commonly using DNA methylation (DNAm). These include ""first-generation"" clocks such as DNAmAgeHorvath and ""second-generation"" clocks such as DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge. The divergence of one's predicted DNAm age from chronological age, termed DNAmAge acceleration (AA), has been linked to mortality and various aging-related conditions, albeit with varying findings. In metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), it remains inconclusive which DNAm-based predictor(s) is/are closely related to these two metabolic conditions. Therefore, we examined the cross-sectional associations between seven DNAm-based predictors and prevalent metabolic conditions in participants with methylation data from the KORA study. We also analyzed the longitudinal association with time-to-incident T2D and the relative prognostic value compared to clinical predictors from the Framingham 8-year T2D risk function in predicting incident disease over eight years. GrimAA and PhenoAA difference demonstrated consistently significant associations in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. GrimAA difference reported a larger effect: with prevalent MetS at F4 (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = [1.06-1.13], p = 2.04E-08), with prevalent T2D at F4 (odds ratio = 1.09 [1.04-1.13], p = 1.38E-04) and with time-to-incident T2D (hazards ratio = 1.05 [1.01-1.10], p = 0.02) for each year increase in GrimAA difference. Mortality risk score was significantly associated with both prevalent metabolic conditions but not in the longitudinal analysis. The inclusion of DNAm-based predictor in the model with Framingham clinical predictors improved discriminative ability, albeit not significantly. Notably, the DNAm-based predictor, when fitted separately, showed a discriminative ability comparable to that of the model with clinical predictors. Overall, no clear pattern of significant associations was identified in the epigenetic measures from the ""first-generation"" clocks. GrimAA, PhenoAA difference and mortality risk score, derived from the ""second-generation"" clocks, demonstrated significant associations with both MetS and T2D. These DNAm-based predictors may be useful biomarkers for risk stratification and disease prognosis in our study sample of European ancestry.

"Impaired neuronal and synaptic function are hallmarks of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding other neuropathological traits and cognitive decline. We previously showed that SFRP1, a glial-derived protein elevated in AD brains from preclinical stages, contributes to disease progression, implicating glial factors in early pathogenesis. Here, we generate and analyze transgenic mice overexpressing astrocytic SFRP1. SFRP1 accumulation causes early dendritic and synaptic defects in adult mice, followed by impaired synaptic long-term potentiation and cognitive decline, evident only when the animals age, thereby mimicking AD's structural-functional temporal distinction. This phenotype correlates with proteomic changes, including increased structural synaptic proteins like neurexin, which localizes in close proximity with SFRP1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. We conclude that excessive SFRP1 hinders synaptic protein turnover, reducing synaptic plasticity-a mechanism that may underlie the synaptopathy observed in the brains of prodromal AD patients.",Neurogenomics,impaired neuronal synaptic function hallmarks early alzheimers disease ad preceding neuropathological traits cognitive decline previously showed sfrp glialderived protein elevated ad brains preclinical stages contributes disease progression implicating glial factors early pathogenesis generate analyze transgenic mice overexpressing astrocytic sfrp sfrp accumulation causes early dendritic synaptic defects adult mice followed impaired synaptic longterm potentiation cognitive decline evident animals age thereby mimicking ads structuralfunctional temporal distinction phenotype correlates proteomic changes including increased structural synaptic proteins like neurexin localizes close proximity sfrp cultured hippocampal neurons conclude excessive sfrp hinders synaptic protein turnover reducing synaptic plasticitya mechanism may underlie synaptopathy observed brains prodromal ad patients,Neurogenomics
"Alcohol use behaviors (AUBs) manifest in a variety of normative and problematic ways across the life course, all of which are heritable. Twin studies show that genetic influences on AUBs change across development, but this is usually not considered in research identifying and investigating the genes linked to AUBs. Understanding the dynamics of how genes shape AUBs could point to critical periods in which interventions may be most effective and provide insight into the mechanisms behind AUB-related genes. In this project, we investigate how genetic associations with AUBs unfold across development using longitudinal modelling of polygenic scores (PGSs). Using results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we created PGSs to index individual-level genetic risk for multiple AUB-related dimensions: <i>Consumption</i>, <i>Problems</i>, a variable pattern of drinking associated with a preference for beer (<i>BeerPref</i>), and externalizing behavior (<i>EXT</i>). We created latent growth curve models and tested PGSs as predictors of latent growth factors (intercept, slope, quadratic) underlying trajectories of AUBs. PGSs were derived in six longitudinal epidemiological cohorts from the US, UK, and Finland. Participant data were obtained from AddHealth, ALSPAC, COGA, FinnTwin12, the older Finnish Twin Cohort, and Spit for Science (total N = 19,194). These cohorts included individuals aged 14 to 67, with repeated measures collected over a span of 4 to 36 years. Primary measures included monthly frequency of typical alcohol consumption (CON) and heavy episodic drinking (HED). Results indicated that higher PGSs for all AUBs are robustly associated with higher mean levels of CON and/or HED (B = 0.064-0.333, <i>p</i> < 3.09E-04). However, these same genetic indices were largely not associated with drinking trajectories across cohorts. In the meta-analysis, only PGSs for chronic alcohol <i>Problems</i> consistently predicted a steeper slope (increasing trajectory) of CON across time (B = 0.470, <i>p</i> = 4.20E-06). The results indicate that genetic associations with AUBs not only differ between behaviors, but also across developmental time points and across cohorts. Genetic studies that take such heterogeneity into account are needed to better represent the underlying etiology of AUBs. Individual-level genetic profiles may be useful to point to personalized intervention timelines, particularly for individuals with high alcohol <i>Problems</i> genetic risk scores.",Neurogenomics,alcohol use behaviors aubs manifest variety normative problematic ways across life course heritable twin studies show genetic influences aubs change across development usually considered research identifying investigating genes linked aubs understanding dynamics genes shape aubs could point critical periods interventions may effective provide insight mechanisms behind aubrelated genes project investigate genetic associations aubs unfold across development using longitudinal modelling polygenic scores pgss using results genomewide association studies gwass created pgss index individuallevel genetic risk multiple aubrelated dimensions iconsumptioni iproblemsi variable pattern drinking associated preference beer ibeerprefi externalizing behavior iexti created latent growth curve models tested pgss predictors latent growth factors intercept slope quadratic underlying trajectories aubs pgss derived six longitudinal epidemiological cohorts us uk finland participant data obtained addhealth alspac coga finntwin older finnish twin cohort spit science total n cohorts included individuals aged repeated measures collected span years primary measures included monthly frequency typical alcohol consumption con heavy episodic drinking hed results indicated higher pgss aubs robustly associated higher mean levels con andor hed b ipi e however genetic indices largely associated drinking trajectories across cohorts metaanalysis pgss chronic alcohol iproblemsi consistently predicted steeper slope increasing trajectory con across time b ipi e results indicate genetic associations aubs differ behaviors also across developmental time points across cohorts genetic studies take heterogeneity account needed better represent underlying etiology aubs individuallevel genetic profiles may useful point personalized intervention timelines particularly individuals high alcohol iproblemsi genetic risk scores,Neurogenomics
"Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a prodromal stage of alpha-synucleinopathies.

While the Parkinson's Disease Related Pattern (PDRP) from <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET is a recognized Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker, its role in tracking progression in prodromal PD remains unclear. To explore PDRP expression across three time points using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET over an 8-year follow-up in iRBD. Thirteen iRBD subjects underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET brain scans at baseline (BL), follow-up 1 (FU1, 4 years), and follow-up 2 (FU2, 8 years).

PDRP z-scores were analyzed within and between groups (converters vs. non-converters) using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA.

There was a significant main effect of group (p = 0.011), time (p < 0.001), and a group*time interaction (p = 0.020), indicating that while PDRP z-scores increased over time in most iRBD subjects, the increase was more pronounced in converters (n = 5) than in non-converters (n = 8).

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS. The chain of events that results in demyelinating lesions is not understood, although most theories assume a primary immune attack on myelin. However, the glial cell adhesion molecule GlialCAM, which forms part of a protein complex in astrocytic endfeet that is crucial for brain ion and water homeostasis, was recently identified as a target for autoimmunity in patients with MS. This complex also includes the astrocytic transmembrane protein MLC1, the water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and the potassium channel KIR4.1. Autoimmunity against AQP4 underlies another demyelinating disorder, neuromyelitis optica, and autoimmunity against KIR4.1 has been implicated in a subtype of MS. Genetic defects in any of these proteins cause leukodystrophies with disruption of brain ion and water homeostasis, which is regulated by astrocytes and secondarily affects myelin. In this Perspective, we argue that an immune attack on the ion and water homeostasis machinery in astrocytic endfeet, rather than directly on myelin, is the primary event in MS and that myelin damage is a consequence of astrocyte dysfunction. This hypothesis is supported by pathological studies on tissue from people with MS and has important implications for disease models and therapy targets.",Neurogenomics,multiple sclerosis ms inflammatory demyelinating disease cns chain events results demyelinating lesions understood although theories assume primary immune attack myelin however glial cell adhesion molecule glialcam forms part protein complex astrocytic endfeet crucial brain ion water homeostasis recently identified target autoimmunity patients ms complex also includes astrocytic transmembrane protein mlc water channel aquaporin aqp potassium channel kir autoimmunity aqp underlies another demyelinating disorder neuromyelitis optica autoimmunity kir implicated subtype ms genetic defects proteins cause leukodystrophies disruption brain ion water homeostasis regulated astrocytes secondarily affects myelin perspective argue immune attack ion water homeostasis machinery astrocytic endfeet rather directly myelin primary event ms myelin damage consequence astrocyte dysfunction hypothesis supported pathological studies tissue people ms important implications disease models therapy targets,Neurogenomics
"Neurons in cortical networks are very sparsely connected; even neurons whose axons and dendrites overlap are highly unlikely to form a synaptic connection. What is the relevance of such sparse connectivity for a network's function? Surprisingly, it has been shown that sparse connectivity impairs information processing in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Does this imply that sparse connectivity also impairs information processing in biological neural networks? Although ANNs were originally inspired by the brain, conventional ANNs differ substantially in their structural network architecture from cortical networks. To disentangle the relevance of these structural properties for information processing in networks, we systematically constructed ANNs constrained by interpretable features of cortical networks. We find that in large and recurrently connected networks, as are found in the cortex, sparse connectivity facilitates time- and data-efficient information processing. We explore the origins of these surprising findings and show that conventional dense ANNs distribute information across only a very small fraction of nodes, whereas sparse ANNs distribute information across more nodes. We show that sparsity is most critical in networks with fixed excitatory and inhibitory nodes, mirroring neuronal cell types in cortex. This constraint causes a large learning delay in densely connected networks which is eliminated by sparse connectivity. Taken together, our findings show that sparse connectivity enables efficient information processing given key constraints from cortical networks, setting the stage for further investigation into higher-order features of cortical connectivity.",Neurogenomics,neurons cortical networks sparsely connected even neurons whose axons dendrites overlap highly unlikely form synaptic connection relevance sparse connectivity networks function surprisingly shown sparse connectivity impairs information processing artificial neural networks anns imply sparse connectivity also impairs information processing biological neural networks although anns originally inspired brain conventional anns differ substantially structural network architecture cortical networks disentangle relevance structural properties information processing networks systematically constructed anns constrained interpretable features cortical networks find large recurrently connected networks found cortex sparse connectivity facilitates time dataefficient information processing explore origins surprising findings show conventional dense anns distribute information across small fraction nodes whereas sparse anns distribute information across nodes show sparsity critical networks fixed excitatory inhibitory nodes mirroring neuronal cell types cortex constraint causes large learning delay densely connected networks eliminated sparse connectivity taken together findings show sparse connectivity enables efficient information processing given key constraints cortical networks setting stage investigation higherorder features cortical connectivity,Neurogenomics
"SNAREopathies constitute a group of severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorders caused by de novo variants that disturb the synaptic release machinery. These neurodevelopmental disorders comprise highly diverse clinical phenotypes, usually including developmental delay, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and sometimes autism spectrum disorder. Despite major progress in genetic testing, current treatments are limited to symptom-directed therapies. There is an urgent need to establish human experimental systems that improve translatability and help develop personalized mechanisms-based treatment strategies. Here we generated CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human induced pluripotent stem-cell (hiPSC) lines carrying the pathogenic variant I67N in the SNAREopathy gene SNAP25. Using fast forward NGN2-dependent programming into forebrain glutamatergic neurons, we examined synaptic phenotypes using electrophysiology and immunostaining, as well as protein changes by means of proteomics. The variant did not affect passive or active electrical properties, but caused changes in synaptic transmission, including reduced evoked and spontaneous release, decreased synaptic vesicle release probability and consequential changes in short-term plasticity towards facilitation. These phenotypes were distinct from those of human neurons differentiated from hiPSCs originating from a patient carrying the V48F variant, which displayed an increase in spontaneous release. The I67N variant phenotype could be ameliorated by the clinically approved K + -channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. Proteomic analysis of hiPSC-derived neurons revealed a significant enrichment in downregulated synaptic proteins (e.g. CALB1, SCN2A, LRRC4B, PPFIA2). Our study demonstrates the use of hiPSC-based models of neurodevelopmental disorders to identify disease mechanisms and to suggest personalized treatment options directly targeting specific synaptic defects.",Neurogenomics,snareopathies constitute group severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorders caused de novo variants disturb synaptic release machinery neurodevelopmental disorders comprise highly diverse clinical phenotypes usually including developmental delay epilepsy intellectual disability sometimes autism spectrum disorder despite major progress genetic testing current treatments limited symptomdirected therapies urgent need establish human experimental systems improve translatability help develop personalized mechanismsbased treatment strategies generated crisprcasengineered human induced pluripotent stemcell hipsc lines carrying pathogenic variant snareopathy gene snap using fast forward ngndependent programming forebrain glutamatergic neurons examined synaptic phenotypes using electrophysiology immunostaining well protein changes means proteomics variant affect passive active electrical properties caused changes synaptic transmission including reduced evoked spontaneous release decreased synaptic vesicle release probability consequential changes shortterm plasticity towards facilitation phenotypes distinct human neurons differentiated hipscs originating patient carrying vf variant displayed increase spontaneous release variant phenotype could ameliorated clinically approved k channel blocker aminopyridine proteomic analysis hipscderived neurons revealed significant enrichment downregulated synaptic proteins eg calb scna lrrcb ppfia study demonstrates use hipscbased models neurodevelopmental disorders identify disease mechanisms suggest personalized treatment options directly targeting specific synaptic defects,Neurogenomics
"The genetic makeup of parents can directly or indirectly affect their offspring phenome through genetic transmission or via the environment that is influenced by parental heritable traits. Our understanding of the mechanisms by which indirect genetic effects operate is limited. Here, we hypothesize that one mechanism is via the offspring methylome. To test this hypothesis, polygenic scores (PGSs) for schizophrenia, smoking initiation, educational attainment (EA), social deprivation, body mass index (BMI), and height were analyzed in a cohort of 1528 offspring and their parents (51.5% boys, mean [SD] age = 10 [2.8] years). We modelled parent and offspring PGSs on offspring buccal-DNA methylation, accounting for the own PGS of offspring, and found significant associations between parental PGSs for schizophrenia, EA, BMI, and height, and offspring buccal methylation sites, comprising 16, 2, 1, and 6 sites, respectively (alpha = 2.7 × 10<sup>-5</sup>).

"The purpose of this letter to the editor is to illustrate the effect of tofacitinib on psoriatic skin lesions in a patient with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) type 7/Singleton-Merten syndrome 1. AGS is characterized by an encephalopathy of variable severity and systemic autoinflammatory manifestations due to continuous type I interferon (IFN) induction. While traditional JAK 1/2 inhibitors like baricitinib and ruxolitinib have proven effectiveness for systemic inflammatory symptoms, they face reimbursement issues in some countries. Tofacitinib, a JAK 1/3 inhibitor, significantly improved psoriatic skin lesions in our patient without the need for additional immunosuppressive therapy. Within one month of starting tofacitinib, psoriatic rashes and ulcerative skin lesions markedly improved, in the absence of a reduction in the IFN-stimulated gene signature or CD169 expression on monocytes. The clinical benefits persisted until the treatment was discontinued, after which symptoms recurred. Resuming tofacitinib treatment again led to improvement. No adverse effects were observed. This case highlights the potential of tofacitinib as a clinically effective treatment for psoriatic skin lesions in AGS and offers a viable alternative for JAK 1/2 inhibitors for this target symptom.

"Psychiatric disorders are highly heritable and polygenic, influenced by environmental factors and often comorbid. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) through consortium efforts have identified genetic risk loci and revealed the underlying biology of psychiatric disorders and traits. However, over 85% of psychiatric GWAS participants are of European ancestry, limiting the applicability of these findings to non-European populations. Latin America and the Caribbean, regions marked by diverse genetic admixture, distinct environments and healthcare disparities, remain critically understudied in psychiatric genomics. This threatens access to precision psychiatry, where diversity is crucial for innovation and equity. This Review evaluates the current state and advancements in psychiatric genomics within Latin America and the Caribbean, discusses the prevalence and burden of psychiatric disorders, explores contributions to psychiatric GWASs from these regions and highlights methods that account for genetic diversity.

"Infectious mononucleosis (IM), predominantly caused by primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, is a common disease in adolescents and young adults. EBV infection is nearly ubiquitous globally. Although primary EBV infection is asymptomatic in most individuals, IM manifests in a subset infected during adolescence or young adulthood. IM occurrence is linked to sibship structure, and is associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis, other autoimmune diseases, and cancer later in life. We analyzed 47 biomarkers in 5,526 Danish individuals aged 18-60 years, of whom 604 had a history of IM, examining their associations with IM history up to 48 years after IM diagnosis. No significant long-term associations were observed after adjusting for multiple comparisons. When restricting the analysis to individuals measured within 10 years post-IM diagnosis, a statistically significant increase in CRP levels was observed in females. This association was not driven by oral contraceptive use. No significant associations between sibship structure and biomarker levels were detected. In conclusion, our study shows that while IM may lead to a transient increase in CRP levels in females, it does not result in long-term alterations in plasma biomarkers related to immune function, suggesting other mechanisms may be responsible for the long-term health impacts associated with IM.",Neurogenomics,infectious mononucleosis im predominantly caused primary epsteinbarr virus ebv infection common disease adolescents young adults ebv infection nearly ubiquitous globally although primary ebv infection asymptomatic individuals im manifests subset infected adolescence young adulthood im occurrence linked sibship structure associated increased risk multiple sclerosis autoimmune diseases cancer later life analyzed biomarkers danish individuals aged years history im examining associations im history years im diagnosis significant longterm associations observed adjusting multiple comparisons restricting analysis individuals measured within years postim diagnosis statistically significant increase crp levels observed females association driven oral contraceptive use significant associations sibship structure biomarker levels detected conclusion study shows im may lead transient increase crp levels females result longterm alterations plasma biomarkers related immune function suggesting mechanisms may responsible longterm health impacts associated im,Neurogenomics
"GWAS of Alzheimer's disease have been predominantly based on European ancestry cohorts with clinically diagnosed patients. Increasing the ancestral diversity of GWAS and focusing on imaging brain biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease may lead to the identification of new genetic loci. Here, we perform a GWAS on cerebral β-amyloid deposition measured by PET imaging in 3,885 East Asians and a cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis with data from 11,816 European participants. Our GWAS analysis replicates known loci (APOE4, CR1, and FERMT2) and identifies a novel locus near SORL1 that is significantly associated with β-amyloid deposition. Single-nucleus expression analysis shows that SORL1 is differentially expressed according to β-amyloid positivity in microglia. Our joint association analysis using the SORL1 lead variant (rs76490923) and the APOE4 allele demonstrates that the risk of β-amyloid deposition is reduced by up to 43.5% in APOE4 non-carriers and up to 55.6% in APOE4 carriers, according to the allelic dosage of the rs76490923 T allele. Our findings suggest that SORL1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in relation to β-amyloid deposition.",Neurogenomics,gwas alzheimers disease predominantly based european ancestry cohorts clinically diagnosed patients increasing ancestral diversity gwas focusing imaging brain biomarkers alzheimers disease may lead identification new genetic loci perform gwas cerebral amyloid deposition measured pet imaging east asians crossancestry gwas metaanalysis data european participants gwas analysis replicates known loci apoe cr fermt identifies novel locus near sorl significantly associated amyloid deposition singlenucleus expression analysis shows sorl differentially expressed according amyloid positivity microglia joint association analysis using sorl lead variant rs apoe allele demonstrates risk amyloid deposition reduced apoe noncarriers apoe carriers according allelic dosage rs allele findings suggest sorl may play important role pathogenesis alzheimers disease particularly relation amyloid deposition,Neurogenomics
"Dense core vesicles (DCVs) transport and release various neuropeptides and neurotrophins that control diverse brain functions, but the DCV secretory pathway remains poorly understood. Here, we tested a prediction emerging from invertebrate studies about the crucial role of the intracellular trafficking GTPase Rab10, by assessing DCV exocytosis at single-cell resolution upon acute Rab10 depletion in mature mouse hippocampal neurons, to circumvent potential confounding effects of Rab10's established role in neurite outgrowth. We observed a significant inhibition of DCV exocytosis in Rab10-depleted neurons, whereas synaptic vesicle exocytosis was unaffected. However, rather than a direct involvement in DCV trafficking, this effect was attributed to two ER-dependent processes, ER-regulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, and protein synthesis. Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed proteins upon Rab10 depletion identified substantial alterations in synaptic and ER/ribosomal proteins, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump SERCA2. In addition, ER morphology and dynamics were altered, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were depleted, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis was impaired in Rab10-depleted neurons. However, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry using a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore still triggered less DCV exocytosis. Instead, leucine supplementation, which enhances protein synthesis, largely rescued DCV exocytosis deficiency. We conclude that Rab10 is required for neuropeptide release by maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and regulating protein synthesis. Furthermore, DCV exocytosis appeared more dependent on (acute) protein synthesis than synaptic vesicle exocytosis.",Neurogenomics,dense core vesicles dcvs transport release various neuropeptides neurotrophins control diverse brain functions dcv secretory pathway remains poorly understood tested prediction emerging invertebrate studies crucial role intracellular trafficking gtpase rab assessing dcv exocytosis singlecell resolution upon acute rab depletion mature mouse hippocampal neurons circumvent potential confounding effects rabs established role neurite outgrowth observed significant inhibition dcv exocytosis rabdepleted neurons whereas synaptic vesicle exocytosis unaffected however rather direct involvement dcv trafficking effect attributed two erdependent processes erregulated intracellular casupsup dynamics protein synthesis gene ontology analysis differentially expressed proteins upon rab depletion identified substantial alterations synaptic erribosomal proteins including casupsup pump serca addition er morphology dynamics altered er casupsup levels depleted casupsup homeostasis impaired rabdepleted neurons however casupsup entry using casupsup ionophore still triggered less dcv exocytosis instead leucine supplementation enhances protein synthesis largely rescued dcv exocytosis deficiency conclude rab required neuropeptide release maintaining casupsup dynamics regulating protein synthesis furthermore dcv exocytosis appeared dependent acute protein synthesis synaptic vesicle exocytosis,Neurogenomics
"Genetic influences account for a substantial proportion of individual differences in alcohol use behaviors (AUBs). However, multiple distinct sets of genes are linked to different AUBs via uncertain causal links. Here, we explore whether intermediate neurobiological traits mediate the relationship between polygenic scores (PGSs) and multiple AUBs, with the aim to better understand processes captured by different genetic profiles. We derived four alcohol-related PGSs in participants from Spit for Science, a longitudinal study of college students in the United States (n = 4549). Using linear regression, we tested the relationship between PGSs and 22 potential mediators, including personality, alcohol expectancies, drinking motives, and alcohol sensitivity. Nominally significant effects were carried forward to a multiple mediation model to estimate direct and indirect effects on four measured AUBs (frequency, quantity, alcohol use disorder symptoms [AUDsx], and maximum drinks in 24 h). In univariable regression, PGSs indexing genetic effects on drinks per week (DPW) and problematic alcohol use (PAU) predicted higher levels of impulsivity and drinking motives as well as lower alcohol sensitivity. BeerPref PGSs (indexing a variable pattern of alcohol problems and preference for beer) predicted higher negative urgency and lower alcohol sensitivity. Mediational models indicated direct and indirect effects of DPW PGSs on multiple AUBs via social/enhancement drinking motives and alcohol sensitivity, indirect effects of PAU PGSs on AUDsx, and indirect effects of BeerPref PGS on drinking frequency and AUDsx via the joint effect of mediators including alcohol sensitivity. These findings provide evidence that the genetic influences on AUBs are associated with and partially mediated by intermediate neurobiological and cognitive factors, which may be more amenable to intervention. Greater focus on drinking motives and alcohol sensitivity is warranted in genetic research, as well as attention to the heterogeneous pathways linking genes to alcohol use outcomes.",Neurogenomics,genetic influences account substantial proportion individual differences alcohol use behaviors aubs however multiple distinct sets genes linked different aubs via uncertain causal links explore whether intermediate neurobiological traits mediate relationship polygenic scores pgss multiple aubs aim better understand processes captured different genetic profiles derived four alcoholrelated pgss participants spit science longitudinal study college students united states n using linear regression tested relationship pgss potential mediators including personality alcohol expectancies drinking motives alcohol sensitivity nominally significant effects carried forward multiple mediation model estimate direct indirect effects four measured aubs frequency quantity alcohol use disorder symptoms audsx maximum drinks h univariable regression pgss indexing genetic effects drinks per week dpw problematic alcohol use pau predicted higher levels impulsivity drinking motives well lower alcohol sensitivity beerpref pgss indexing variable pattern alcohol problems preference beer predicted higher negative urgency lower alcohol sensitivity mediational models indicated direct indirect effects dpw pgss multiple aubs via socialenhancement drinking motives alcohol sensitivity indirect effects pau pgss audsx indirect effects beerpref pgs drinking frequency audsx via joint effect mediators including alcohol sensitivity findings provide evidence genetic influences aubs associated partially mediated intermediate neurobiological cognitive factors may amenable intervention greater focus drinking motives alcohol sensitivity warranted genetic research well attention heterogeneous pathways linking genes alcohol use outcomes,Neurogenomics
"Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous. Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20-40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case-control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in Aβ<sup>+</sup> and phosphorylated tau<sup>+</sup> (A+T<sub>1</sub>+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations. Regarding cognitive prognosis, CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 predicted conversion from A+T<sub>1</sub>+ cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 7.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and A+T<sub>1</sub>+ mild cognitive impairment to dementia (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 2.2, P = 8.2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>) over a 15-year follow-up, adjusting for CSF pTau<sub>181</sub>:Aβ<sub>42</sub>, CSF neurofilament, CSF neurogranin, CSF growth-associated protein 43, age, APOE4 and sex. We also developed a plasma proteomic signature of CI, which we evaluated in 13,401 samples, which partly recapitulated CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 as a robust prognostic biomarker for cognitive resilience versus AD onset and progression, highlight the potential of plasma proteomics in replacing CSF measurement and further implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.",Neurogenomics,rates cognitive decline alzheimers disease ad extremely heterogeneous although biomarkers amyloidbeta tau proteins hallmark ad pathologies improved pathologybased diagnosis explain variance adrelated cognitive impairment ci discover novel biomarkers ci ad performed cerebrospinal fluid csf proteomics individuals six major prospective ad casecontrol cohorts synapse proteins emerged strongest correlates ci independent tau using machine learning derived csf ywhagnptx synapse protein ratio explained variance ci beyond csf ptausubsubasubsub beyond tau positron emission tomography beyond csf neurofilament growthassociated protein neurogranin asupsup phosphorylated tausupsup atsubsub individuals csf ywhagnptx also increased normal aging years estimated symptom onset carriers autosomal dominant ad mutations regarding cognitive prognosis csf ywhagnptx predicted conversion atsubsub cognitively normal mild cognitive impairment standard deviation increase hazard ratio p supsup atsubsub mild cognitive impairment dementia standard deviation increase hazard ratio p supsup year followup adjusting csf ptausubsubasubsub csf neurofilament csf neurogranin csf growthassociated protein age apoe sex also developed plasma proteomic signature ci evaluated samples partly recapitulated csf ywhagnptx overall findings underscore csf ywhagnptx robust prognostic biomarker cognitive resilience versus ad onset progression highlight potential plasma proteomics replacing csf measurement implicate synapse dysfunction core driver ad dementia,Neurogenomics
"To identify the genetic cause in a previously unsolved pedigree, with mother and two daughters suffering of dilated cardiomyopathy with prevailing arrhythmic burden associated with diabetes mellitus and sensorineural hearing loss, without clear evidence of progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Several genetic tests were performed over the years including single-gene sequencing, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, NGS panel for mitochondrial diseases and cardiomyopathies, clinical exome sequencing and whole exome sequencing. Specific amplifications and long-read NGS were used to evaluate mtDNA structural alterations. By means of whole exome sequencing we found a novel heteroplasmic 12 kb-long single deletion in the mtDNA in all affected family members, confirmed by long-range PCR. However, a deeper investigation by long-read NGS revealed indeed the presence of rearranged mtDNA species, formed by a wild-type plus a deleted molecule. This mtDNA duplication turned out to be inherited in our pedigree and present in all tested specimens. While mtDNA single large-scale deletions are generally considered sporadic, few old reports described maternally inherited mtDNA duplication We suggest that mtDNA large rearrangements should be considered as possible disease causes in familial cases with unusual mitochondrial phenotypes.

"The <i>Apolipoprotein E (APOE)</i> e4 and e2 alleles are respectively the most risk increasing and risk decreasing, common genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD)<sup>1,2</sup>. They strongly affect Aβ burden in the brain parenchyma<sup>1</sup>, a core hallmark of AD, but also at the level of the brain vasculature, i.e. cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)<sup>1,3</sup>, which in turn relates to increased risk for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in <i>APOE</i>*4 carriers when receiving anti-Aβ antibody treatments<sup>4</sup>. This makes <i>APOE</i> a highly pursued AD drug target. A crucial question in the field is whether it would be beneficial to either increase or decrease <i>APOE</i> (particularly <i>APOE</i>*4) levels<sup>5</sup>. The answer from rodent work appears to converge on ""decreasing <i>APOE</i> levels""<sup>5-7</sup>, with initial human studies supporting this<sup>5,8,9</sup>.

Downstream analyses suggested this signal links to the nearby <i>APOC2</i> gene through local effects on methylation. We applaud the authors on their timely, relevant, and well-conducted study. Here, we extend on these findings, highlighting there is compelling evidence that their genetic signal for reduced CAA relates to an effect on reduced microglial <i>APOE</i> expression, which would importantly support the evidence in favor of ""decreasing <i>APOE</i> levels"" and further herald this promising therapeutic avenue, not just for AD, but also for CAA.

"Schizophrenia is an often devastating disorder characterized by persistent and idiopathic cognitive deficits, delusions and hallucinations. Schizophrenia has been associated with impaired nervous system development and an excitation/inhibition imbalance in the prefrontal cortex. On a molecular level, schizophrenia is moderately heritable and genetically complex. Hundreds of risk genes have been identified, spanning a heterogeneous landscape dominated by loci that confer relatively small risk. Bioinformatic analyses of genetic associations point to a limited set of neurons, mainly excitatory cortical neurons, but other analyses suggest the importance of astrocytes and microglia. To understand different cell type roles in schizophrenia and reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia, our study integrated genetic analysis with single nucleus RNA-seq of 536,618 nuclei from postmortem samples of dorsal prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 8/9) of 43 cases with schizophrenia and 42 neurotypical controls. We found no significant difference in cell type abundance. Gene expression in excitatory layer 2-3 intra-telencephalic neurons had the greatest number of differentially expressed transcripts and, together with excitatory deep layer intra-telencephalic neurons, conferred most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Most differential expression of genes was found in specific cell types and was dominated by down-regulated transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets including transmembrane transport, mitochondrial function, protein folding, and cell-cell signaling whereas up-regulated transcripts were enriched in gene sets related to RNA processing, including RNA splicing in neurons. Co-regulation network analysis identified 40 schizophrenia-relevant programs across 13 cell types. A gene program largely shared between neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes was significantly enriched for schizophrenia risk, supporting an aetiological role for perturbed protein modification, ion transport, and mitochondrial function. These results were largely consistent with cell-type expression quantitative trait locus and transcriptome-wide association analyses. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing results, most prominently mitochondrial dysfunction, had multiple points of convergence with proteomic and long-read RNA sequencing results from samples from the same donors. Our study integrates genetic analysis with transcriptomics to reveal novel cell-type specific aetiologically relevant perturbations in schizophrenia.",Neurogenomics,schizophrenia often devastating disorder characterized persistent idiopathic cognitive deficits delusions hallucinations schizophrenia associated impaired nervous system development excitationinhibition imbalance prefrontal cortex molecular level schizophrenia moderately heritable genetically complex hundreds risk genes identified spanning heterogeneous landscape dominated loci confer relatively small risk bioinformatic analyses genetic associations point limited set neurons mainly excitatory cortical neurons analyses suggest importance astrocytes microglia understand different cell type roles schizophrenia reveal novel celltype specific aetiologically relevant perturbations schizophrenia study integrated genetic analysis single nucleus rnaseq nuclei postmortem samples dorsal prefrontal cortex brodmann area cases schizophrenia neurotypical controls found significant difference cell type abundance gene expression excitatory layer intratelencephalic neurons greatest number differentially expressed transcripts together excitatory deep layer intratelencephalic neurons conferred genetic risk schizophrenia differential expression genes found specific cell types dominated downregulated transcripts downregulated transcripts enriched gene sets including transmembrane transport mitochondrial function protein folding cellcell signaling whereas upregulated transcripts enriched gene sets related rna processing including rna splicing neurons coregulation network analysis identified schizophreniarelevant programs across cell types gene program largely shared neuronal subtypes astrocytes oligodendrocytes significantly enriched schizophrenia risk supporting aetiological role perturbed protein modification ion transport mitochondrial function results largely consistent celltype expression quantitative trait locus transcriptomewide association analyses moreover singlecell rna sequencing results prominently mitochondrial dysfunction multiple points convergence proteomic longread rna sequencing results samples donors study integrates genetic analysis transcriptomics reveal novel celltype specific aetiologically relevant perturbations schizophrenia,Neurogenomics
"Cognitive judgement bias in decision-making under ambiguity occurs both in animals and humans, with some individuals interpreting ambiguous stimulus as positive (optimism) and others as negative (pessimism). We hypothesize that judgement bias is a personality trait and that individuals with a pessimistic bias would be more reactive to stressors and therefore more susceptible to stress-related diseases than optimistic ones. Here, we show that zebrafish judgment bias is a consistent behavioral trait over time, and that pessimistic and optimistic fish express phenotype-specific neurogenomic responses to stress. Furthermore, both phenotypes show differential activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis in response to chronic stress, suggesting that optimists have a lower stress reactivity. Accordingly, optimists seem to be more resilient to disease than pessimists, as shown by a lower tumorigenesis in a zebrafish melanoma line [Tg(mtifa:HRAS-GFP)]. Together these results indicate that judgement bias is paralleled by differences in the stress response with implications for disease resilience.",Neurogenomics,cognitive judgement bias decisionmaking ambiguity occurs animals humans individuals interpreting ambiguous stimulus positive optimism others negative pessimism hypothesize judgement bias personality trait individuals pessimistic bias would reactive stressors therefore susceptible stressrelated diseases optimistic ones show zebrafish judgment bias consistent behavioral trait time pessimistic optimistic fish express phenotypespecific neurogenomic responses stress furthermore phenotypes show differential activation hypothalamicpituitaryinterrenal axis response chronic stress suggesting optimists lower stress reactivity accordingly optimists seem resilient disease pessimists shown lower tumorigenesis zebrafish melanoma line tgmtifahrasgfp together results indicate judgement bias paralleled differences stress response implications disease resilience,Neurogenomics
"The gene CELSR3 (Cadherin EGF LAG Seven-pass-G-type Receptor 3) has been recently recognized as a high-confidence risk factor for Tourette syndrome (TS). Additionally, Celsr3 mutant mice have been reported to exhibit TS-related behaviors and increased dopamine release in the striatum. Building on these findings, we further characterized the neurobehavioral and molecular profile of Celsr3 mutant mice to understand better the biological mechanisms connecting the deficiency of this gene and TS-related phenotypes. Our analyses confirmed that Celsr3 mutant mice displayed grooming stereotypies and tic-like jerks, as well as sensorimotor gating deficits, which were opposed by TS therapies. Spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed widespread extracellular matrix abnormalities in the striatum of Celsr3 mutants. Single-nucleus transcriptomics also showed significant upregulation of the Drd3 gene, encoding the dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor, in striosomal D<sub>1</sub>-positive neurons. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence confirmed dysregulated D<sub>3</sub> receptor expression, with lower levels in presynaptic striatal fibers and higher levels in striatal D<sub>1</sub>-positive neurons.

"The beat-by-beat fluctuation of heart rate (HR) in its temporal sequence (HR dynamics) provides information on HR regulation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and its dysregulation in pathological states. Commonly, linear analyses of HR and its variability (HRV) are used to draw conclusions about pathological states despite clear statistical and translational limitations. The main aim of this study was to compare linear and nonlinear HR measures, including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), based on ECG recordings by radiotelemetry in C57BL/6N mice to identify pathological HR dynamics. We investigated different behavioral and a wide range of pharmacological interventions which alter ANS regulation through various peripheral and/or central mechanisms including receptors implicated in psychiatric disorders. This spectrum of interventions served as a reference system for comparison of linear and nonlinear HR measures to identify pathological states. Physiological HR dynamics constitute a self-similar, scale-invariant, fractal process with persistent intrinsic long-range correlations resulting in physiological DFA scaling coefficients of α~1. Strongly altered DFA scaling coefficients (α ≠ 1) indicate pathological states of HR dynamics as elicited by (1) parasympathetic blockade, (2) parasympathetic overactivation and (3) sympathetic overactivation but not inhibition. The DFA scaling coefficients are identical in mice and humans under physiological conditions with identical pathological states by defined pharmacological interventions. Here, we show the importance of tonic vagal function for physiological HR dynamics in mice, as reported in humans. Unlike linear measures, DFA provides an important translational measure that reliably identifies pathological HR dynamics based on altered ANS control by pharmacological interventions.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behavior, typically diagnosed during early childhood and attributed to altered neuronal network connectivity. Several genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to ASD, including pre- or early life immune activation, which can trigger microglial and astroglial reactivity, impacting early neurodevelopment. In ASD, astrocytes show altered glutamate metabolism, directly influencing neuronal network activity, while microglia display impaired synaptic pruning, an essential developmental process for the refinement of neuronal connections. Additionally, reduced myelination in specific cortical and subcortical regions may affect brain connectivity in ASD, with white matter integrity correlating with the severity of the disorder, suggesting an important role for oligodendrocytes and myelin in ASD.

This review seeks to summarise all available data on the recently identified autosomal recessive subtype of dystonia caused by variants in <i>AOPEP</i>, focusing on the geographical origins of affected families, mutational spectrum, phenotypic expressions and pathophysiology. <i>AOPEP</i>-related dystonia, documented as Zech-Boesch syndrome in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, has been diagnosed in cohorts around the globe including under-represented populations with increased rates of consanguinity. Predictably leading to loss of protein function, the majority (74%) of disease-associated <i>AOPEP</i> alleles are protein-truncating variants comprising homozygous and compound heterozygous stop-gain, frameshift and splice-site changes. The dystonic disorder shows onset from childhood to the fourth decade and generalises in a significant proportion of cases (60%). Variable expressivity and age-related penetrance are likely to play a role in manifestation of the condition, consistent with occasional occurrence of <i>AOPEP</i> homozygous pathogenic variants in subjects without a diagnosis of dystonia. <i>AOPEP</i> encodes aminopeptidase O, a proteolytic processing enzyme that is preferentially expressed in glia and potentially linked to endosomal-lysosomal pathways. <i>AOPEP</i>-related autosomal recessive Zech-Boesch syndrome is of worldwide relevance for the diagnosis of genetic dystonia.

"While the p-value threshold of 5.0 ×10-8 remains the standard for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans and other species, it still needs to be updated to reflect the current era of large-scale GWAS, where tens of thousands of sample sizes are used to discover genetic associations at loci with smaller minor allele frequencies. In this study, we used a dataset of 348,501 individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank to determine the GWAS thresholds required for multiple testing corrections when considering rare and common variants in additive and dominant GWAS models. Additionally, we employed conditional and joint (COJO) analysis to quantify the proportion of false significant hits in the GWAS results for 72 traits in the UK Biobank when applying the traditional GWAS cut-off versus our newly proposed p-value thresholds. Overall, the results indicate that the conventional GWAS significance threshold of 5.0 ×10-8 yields a false positive rate of between 20% and 30% in GWAS studies that utilize large sample sizes and less common variants. Instead, a more stringent GWAS p-value threshold of 5.0 ×10-8 is needed when rare variants (with minor allele frequency > 0.1%) are included in the association test for both additive and dominance models within the European ancestry population.

"Tight control of cGAS-STING-mediated DNA sensing is crucial to avoid auto-inflammation. The GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is crucial to maintain cGAS-STING homeostasis and various pathogenic ARF1 variants are associated with type I interferonopathies. Functional ARF1 inhibits STING activity by maintaining mitochondrial integrity and facilitating COPI-mediated retrograde STING trafficking and deactivation. Yet the factors governing the two distinct functions of ARF1 remained unexplored. Here, we dissect ARF1's dual role by a comparative analysis of disease-associated ARF1 variants and their impact on STING signalling. We identify a de novo heterozygous s.55 C > T/p.R19C ARF1 variant in a patient with type I interferonopathy symptoms. The GTPase-deficient variant ARF1 R19C selectively disrupts COPI binding and retrograde transport of STING, thereby prolonging innate immune activation without affecting mitochondrial integrity. Treatment of patient fibroblasts in vitro with the STING signalling inhibitors H-151 and amlexanox reduces chronic interferon signalling. Summarizing, our data reveal the molecular basis of a ARF1-associated type I interferonopathy allowing dissection of the two roles of ARF1, and suggest that pharmacological targeting of STING may alleviate ARF1-associated auto-inflammation.",Neurogenomics,tight control cgasstingmediated dna sensing crucial avoid autoinflammation gtpase adpribosylation factor arf crucial maintain cgassting homeostasis various pathogenic arf variants associated type interferonopathies functional arf inhibits sting activity maintaining mitochondrial integrity facilitating copimediated retrograde sting trafficking deactivation yet factors governing two distinct functions arf remained unexplored dissect arfs dual role comparative analysis diseaseassociated arf variants impact sting signalling identify de novo heterozygous c tprc arf variant patient type interferonopathy symptoms gtpasedeficient variant arf rc selectively disrupts copi binding retrograde transport sting thereby prolonging innate immune activation without affecting mitochondrial integrity treatment patient fibroblasts vitro sting signalling inhibitors h amlexanox reduces chronic interferon signalling summarizing data reveal molecular basis arfassociated type interferonopathy allowing dissection two roles arf suggest pharmacological targeting sting may alleviate arfassociated autoinflammation,Neurogenomics
"Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts.

"Neurons adapt to chronic activity changes by modifying synaptic properties, including neurotransmitter release. However, whether neuropeptide release via dense core vesicles (DCVs)-a distinct regulated secretory pathway-undergoes similar adaptation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 24-hour action potential blockade leads to significant DCV accumulation in primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Reactivation with action potential trains induced enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx and 700% more DCV exocytosis compared to control neurons. Notably, total DCV cargo protein levels were unchanged, while mRNA levels of corresponding genes were reduced. Blocking neurotransmitter release with Tetanus toxin induced DCV accumulation, similar to that induced by network silencing with TTX. Hence, chronic network silencing triggers increased DCV accumulation due to reduced exocytosis during silencing. These accumulated DCVs can be released upon reactivation resulting in a massive potentiation of DCV exocytosis, possibly contributing to homeostatic mechanisms.<b>Significance Statement</b> This study addresses an unexplored area - how dense core vesicles (DCVs) exocytosis adapts to chronic changes in activity - and demonstrates accumulation of DCVs and a massive upregulation of DCV exocytosis in response to 24h inactivity.

"The genetic component of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), accounting for ~10% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, is largely unexplained. Recent studies suggest that EOAD may be enriched for variants acting in the lipid pathway. The current study examines the shared genetic heritability between EOAD and the lipid pathway using genome-wide multi-trait genetic covariance analyses. Summary statistics were obtained from the GWAS meta-analyses of EOAD by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (n=19,668) and five blood lipid traits by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (n=1,320,016). The significant results were compared between the EOAD and lipids GWAS and genetic covariance analyses were performed via SUPERGNOVA. Genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with top EOAD hits in identified regions of covariance with lipid traits were scored and ranked for causality by combining evidence from gene-based analysis, AD-risk scores incorporating transcriptomic and proteomic evidence, eQTL data, eQTL colocalization analyses, DNA methylation data, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Direct comparison of GWAS results showed 5 loci overlapping between EOAD and at least one lipid trait harboring APOE, TREM2, MS4A4E, LILRA5, and LRRC25. Local genetic covariance analyses identified 3 regions of covariance between EOAD and at least one lipid trait. Gene prioritization nominated 3 likely causative genes at these loci: ANKDD1B, CUZD1, and MS4A64.The current study identified genetic covariance between EOAD and lipids, providing further evidence of shared genetic architecture and mechanistic pathways between the two traits.",Neurogenomics,genetic component earlyonset alzheimer disease eoad accounting alzheimers disease ad cases largely unexplained recent studies suggest eoad may enriched variants acting lipid pathway current study examines shared genetic heritability eoad lipid pathway using genomewide multitrait genetic covariance analyses summary statistics obtained gwas metaanalyses eoad alzheimers disease genetics consortium n five blood lipid traits global lipids genetics consortium n significant results compared eoad lipids gwas genetic covariance analyses performed via supergnova genes linkage disequilibrium ld top eoad hits identified regions covariance lipid traits scored ranked causality combining evidence genebased analysis adrisk scores incorporating transcriptomic proteomic evidence eqtl data eqtl colocalization analyses dna methylation data singlecell rna sequencing analyses direct comparison gwas results showed loci overlapping eoad least one lipid trait harboring apoe trem msae lilra lrrc local genetic covariance analyses identified regions covariance eoad least one lipid trait gene prioritization nominated likely causative genes loci ankddb cuzd msathe current study identified genetic covariance eoad lipids providing evidence shared genetic architecture mechanistic pathways two traits,Neurogenomics
"Large-scale studies using hypothesis-free exome sequencing have revealed the strong heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and their molecular overlap with later-onset, progressive, movement disorders phenotypes. In this review, we focus on the shared genetic landscape of NDDs and movement disorders. Cumulative research has shown that up to 30% of cases labelled as ""cerebral palsy"" have a monogenic etiology. Causal pathogenic variants are particularly enriched in genes previously associated with adult-onset progressive movement disorders, such as spastic paraplegias, dystonias, and cerebellar ataxias. Biological pathways that have emerged as common culprits are transcriptional regulation, neuritogenesis, and synaptic function. Defects in the same genes can cause neurological dysfunction both during early development and later in life. We highlight the implications of the increasing number of NDD gene etiologies for genetic testing in movement disorders. Finally, we discuss gaps and opportunities in the translation of this knowledge to the bedside.",Neurogenomics,largescale studies using hypothesisfree exome sequencing revealed strong heritability neurodevelopmental disorders ndds molecular overlap lateronset progressive movement disorders phenotypes review focus shared genetic landscape ndds movement disorders cumulative research shown cases labelled cerebral palsy monogenic etiology causal pathogenic variants particularly enriched genes previously associated adultonset progressive movement disorders spastic paraplegias dystonias cerebellar ataxias biological pathways emerged common culprits transcriptional regulation neuritogenesis synaptic function defects genes cause neurological dysfunction early development later life highlight implications increasing number ndd gene etiologies genetic testing movement disorders finally discuss gaps opportunities translation knowledge bedside,Neurogenomics
"Age is a significant risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identifying brain age patterns is critical for comprehending the normal aging and MCI/AD processes. Prior studies have widely established the univariate relationships between brain regions and age, while multivariate associations remain largely unexplored. Herein, various artificial intelligence (AI) models were employed to perform brain age prediction using an MRI dataset (n=668). Then the optimal AI model was integrated with the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) feature importance technique to identify the significant multivariate brain regions involved in this prediction. Our results indicated that the deep learning model (referred to as AgeNet) tremendously outperformed the conventional machine learning models for brain age prediction, and AgeNet integrated with SHAP (referred to as AgeNet-SHAP) identified all ground-truth perturbed regions as key predictors of brain age in semi-simulation, proved the validity of our methodology. In the experimental dataset, compared to cognitively normal (CN) participants, MCI exhibited moderate differences in brain regions, whereas AD had highly robust and widely distributed regional differences. The individualized AgeNet-SHAP regional features further showed associations with clinical severity scores in the AD continuum.

"Physical activity (PA) is a protective factor against amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This association, however, may differ by apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) genotype. This work examines interactions between age, PA, and neuropathology-based genetic risk for AD (<i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> ) on Aβ burden in cortical regions sensitive to its accumulation. Included were 388 cognitively unimpaired, older (mean age ± SD = 68.10 ± 7.09; 66% female) participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) study. The cohort was enriched with both family history of AD at enrollment and a higher overall prevalence of <i>APOE ε4</i> allele carriage than typically observed in the general population. PA was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Aβ burden was measured using Pittsburg Compound B (<sup>11</sup>C-PiB) PET imaging, which allowed us to derive volume corrected distribution volume ratio (DVR) maps from nine bilateral regions of interest (ROIs) and a global cortical composite score. Linear regression models examined the interactions between age, PA, and <i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> on Aβ burden. Finally, <i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> scores were aggregated according to estimated risk to illustrate the differential effects between active (weekly moderate PA ≥ 150 minutes) and inactive individuals. Three-way interactions (Age × PA × <i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> ) were significant (all <i>P</i>'s ≤ 0.05) for the global cortical composite and six of the examined ROIs (the PPC, ACC, mOFC, SMG, MTG, and STG). Models stratified by <i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> and PA showed greater levels of age-related Aβ accumulation in each of these ROIs, with the greatest effects in inactive participants with high <i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> scores. Individuals with high <i>APOE</i> <sub><i>np</i></sub> scores who concomitantly engage in suboptimal weekly moderate-intensity PA have greater Aβ burden. These findings underscore how both PA and <i>APOE</i> haplotype play intersect in modifying age-related Aβ burden in brain regions susceptible to its deposition in cognitively unimpaired, older adults at risk for AD.",Neurogenomics,physical activity pa protective factor amyloid accumulation adults risk alzheimers disease ad association however may differ apolipoprotein e iapoei genotype work examines interactions age pa neuropathologybased genetic risk ad iapoei subinpisub burden cortical regions sensitive accumulation included cognitively unimpaired older mean age sd female participants wisconsin registry alzheimers prevention wrap study cohort enriched family history ad enrollment higher overall prevalence iapoe allele carriage typically observed general population pa assessed using selfreported questionnaire burden measured using pittsburg compound b supsupcpib pet imaging allowed us derive volume corrected distribution volume ratio dvr maps nine bilateral regions interest rois global cortical composite score linear regression models examined interactions age pa iapoei subinpisub burden finally iapoei subinpisub scores aggregated according estimated risk illustrate differential effects active weekly moderate pa minutes inactive individuals threeway interactions age pa iapoei subinpisub significant ipis global cortical composite six examined rois ppc acc mofc smg mtg stg models stratified iapoei subinpisub pa showed greater levels agerelated accumulation rois greatest effects inactive participants high iapoei subinpisub scores individuals high iapoei subinpisub scores concomitantly engage suboptimal weekly moderateintensity pa greater burden findings underscore pa iapoei haplotype play intersect modifying agerelated burden brain regions susceptible deposition cognitively unimpaired older adults risk ad,Neurogenomics
"While hallmarked by the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles (tau) in the brain, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder that involves additional pathological events, including neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction. AD-associated biomolecular changes seem to be attenuated in carriers of the functionally advantageous variant of the <i>KLOTHO</i> gene (KL-VS<sub>HET</sub>). Independently, better cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with better health outcomes, both in general and specifically with regard to AD pathology. Here we investigate whether the relationships between CRF (peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2peak</sub>)) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core AD biomarkers and those of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and synaptic dysfunction differ for KL-VS<sub>HET</sub> compared to non-carriers (KL-VS<sub>NC</sub>). The cohort, enriched for AD risk, consisted of cognitively unimpaired adults (N=136; Mean<sub>AGE</sub>(SD)=62.5(6.7)) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Covariate-adjusted (age, sex, parental AD history, <i>APOE</i>4+ status, and age difference between CSF sampling and exercise test) linear models examined the interaction between VO<sub>2peak</sub> and <i>KLOTHO</i> genotype on core AD biomarker levels in CSF [phosphorylated tau 181 (pTau<sub>181</sub>), Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub>, pTau<sub>181</sub>/Aβ<sub>42</sub>].

The interaction between VO<sub>2peak</sub> and KL-VS<sub>HET</sub> was significant for <b>tTau</b> (<i>P</i>=0.05), <b>pTau<sub>181</sub></b> (<i>P</i>=0.03), <b>Ng</b> (<i>P</i>=0.02), <b>sTREM2</b> (<i>P</i>=0.03), and <b>YKL-40</b> (<i>P</i>=0.03), such that lower levels of each biomarker were observed for KL-VS<sub>HET</sub> who were more fit.

"To investigate multivariate regional patterns for schizophrenia (SZ) classification, sex differences, and brain age by utilizing structural MRI, demographics, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). Various AI models were employed, and the outperforming model was identified for SZ classification, sex differences, and brain age predictions. For the SZ and sex classification tasks, support vector classifier (SVC), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and deep learning neural network (DL) models were compared. In the case of regression-based brain age prediction, Lasso regression (LR), Ridge regression (RR), support vector regression (SVR), and DL models were compared. For each regression or classification task, the optimal model was further integrated with the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and the significant multivariate brain regional patterns were identified. Our results demonstrated that the DL model outperformed other models in SZ classification, sex differences, and brain age predictions. We then integrated outperforming DL model with SHAP, and this integrated DL-SHAP was used to identify the individualized multivariate regional patterns associated with each prediction. Using DL-SHAP approach, we found that individuals with SZ had anatomical changes particularly in left pallidum, left posterior insula, left hippocampus, and left putamen regions, and such changes associated with SZ were different between female and male patients. Finally, we further applied DL-SHAP method to brain age prediction and suggested important brain regions related to aging in health controls (HC) and SZ processes.

The PGS is higher in mothers of naturally conceived twins compared to mothers who received fertility (MAR) treatments in both the Netherlands and Norway. The largest differences were observed for mothers who received hormonal ovulation induction, indicating maternal fertility issues. A higher PGS was also linked to shorter time to pregnancy.

"Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by genetic and clinical heterogeneity. A recurring p.(Glu303del)-deletion in TOR1A is a well-established cause for DYT-TOR1A (DYT1), an autosomal dominant early-onset isolated dystonia. TOR1A encodes TorsinA, an AAA + ATPase located in the nuclear envelope. By whole exome analyses of a family with a novel dystonia-hemichorea-/hemiballism phenotype, we identified a TOR1AIP2 NM_001199260.2 c.1234A > G p.(Arg412Gly) variant. The variant is very rare in databases and was absent from whole exome data from >1000 dystonia patients. TOR1AIP2 encodes LULL1, a transmembrane protein that activates TorsinA, and correct interaction between TorsinA and LULL1 is essential for proper nuclear envelope architecture. The p.(Arg412Gly) variant disrupts the binding interface between TorsinA and LULL1 around p.Arg412; this same interface is also impaired in DYT1. Functional analyses via a co-purification assay revealed that interaction between TorsinA-LULL1<sup>Arg412Gly</sup> is weaker than the wild-type interaction, and that it resembles the situation in DYT1 (TorsinA<sup>ΔE303</sup>-LULL1). A second family with milder dystonia, hemichorea, and stereotypic leg flexion during gait and a TOR1AIP2 p.(Gln338His) variant was identified. The clinical phenotype of both families shared proximal arm movements, and flutter in facial musculature. Expressivity of the movement disorder symptoms was variable. Several proteins in the nuclear envelope have been implicated in various forms of neurodevelopmental disorders with dystonia.

"There is a need to develop novel facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) biomarkers for use in clinical trials. We examined the muscle excitability properties in FSHD and their use as biomarkers of disease severity. Muscle velocity recovery cycle (MVRC) and frequency ramp recordings were performed on the tibialis anterior (TA) and trapezius muscles in subjects with FSHD. Markers of disease severity including symptom severity, muscle dynamometry and the FSHD-COM functional scale were recorded for disease correlation. Recordings from 20 FSHD subjects were compared to 74 TA and 33 trapezius normal controls. FSHD recordings from distal and proximal muscles demonstrated significantly reduced early and late muscle supernormality measures. There was a moderate correlation between late supernormality changes multiple conditioning in the trapezius and quadriceps dynamometry. Frequency ramp latency changes were significantly blunted in FSHD subjects. The findings are consistent with resting muscle membrane potential depolarisation, but correlations with markers of disease severity were limited. The pathophysiology of FSHD involves not only ultrastructural changes to muscle and its supporting structures, but functional changes in the electrical properties of the muscle membrane.

The overall variant carrier rate for the 31 clinically-relevant variants in the ADSP was 0.3%. We observed that 79.5% of the variant carriers were cases compared to 3.9% were controls. In those with AD, the mean age of onset of AD among carriers of these clinically-relevant variants was 19.6 ± 1.4 years earlier compared with noncarriers (p = 7.8 × 10<sup>-57</sup>). Additionally, we identified 197 rare variants (MAF < 1%) within ADSP participants not reported in known clinical databases.ConclusionsA small proportion of individuals in the ADSP are carriers of a previously-reported clinically-relevant variant allele for AD and these participants have significantly earlier age of AD onset compared to noncarriers.",Neurogenomics,backgroundprior studies examined variants within presenilin ipseni presenilin ipseni amyloid precursor protein iappi genes however previouslyreported clinicallyrelevant variants predicted damaging missense dm variants characterized newer release alzheimers disease sequencing project adspobjectiveto characterize previouslyreported clinicallyrelevant variants dm variants ipsen psen appi within participants adspmethodswe identified rare variants maf ipseni ipseni iappi individuals whole genome sequencing individuals whole exome sequencing available nsubtotal sub additionally curated variants clinvar omim alzforum report carriers variants clinical databases well predicted dm variants genesresultswe detected previouslyreported clinicallyrelevant variants alternate alleles observed within adsp variants ipseni ipseni iappi overall variant carrier rate clinicallyrelevant variants adsp observed variant carriers cases compared controls ad mean age onset ad among carriers clinicallyrelevant variants years earlier compared noncarriers p supsup additionally identified rare variants maf within adsp participants reported known clinical databasesconclusionsa small proportion individuals adsp carriers previouslyreported clinicallyrelevant variant allele ad participants significantly earlier age ad onset compared noncarriers,Neurogenomics
"Shorter stature has been phenotypically linked to increased prevalence of schizophrenia (SCZ), but the nature of this association is unknown. Using genome-wide genetic data, we studied the SCZ-height relationship on a genetic level. Applying novel genetic methods and tools, we analyzed gene-sets, tissue-types, cell-types, local genetic correlation, conditional genetic analyses, and fine-mapping of effector-genes to scrutinize the SCZ-height relationship. We identified 142 genes statistically associated with both SCZ and height and found enrichment in 3 functional gene-sets. Genetic annotations implicated the pituitary and specifically mesenchymal stem cells for height and thyrotropic cells for SCZ. While the global SCZ-height genetic correlation was nonsignificant, 9 genomic regions showed robust local genetic correlations (7 negative, 6 in the MHC-region). The shared genetic signal for SCZ and height within the 6 MHC-regions was partially explained by mutual genetic overlap with white blood cell count, particularly lymphocytes. Fine-mapping prioritized 3 shared effector-genes (GIGYF2, HLA-C, and LIN28B) involved in immune response sensitivity and development of immune and pituitary cell-types.

"Age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are the strongest risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The role of APOE in AD varies with sex and ancestry. While the association of APOE with AD biomarkers also varies across sex and ancestry, no study has systematically investigated both sex-specific and ancestry differences of APOE on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers together, resulting in limited insights and generalizability. To systematically investigate the association of sex and APOE-ε4 with 3 core CSF biomarkers across ancestries. This cohort study examined 3 CSF biomarkers (amyloid β1-42 [Aβ42], phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau], and total tau, in participants from 20 cohorts from July 1, 1985, to March 31, 2020. These individuals were grouped into African, Asian, and European ancestries based on genetic data. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2023, to November 10, 2024. Sex (male or female) and APOE-ε4. The associations of sex and APOE-ε4 with biomarker levels were assessed within each ancestry group, adjusting for age. Meta-analyses were performed to identify these associations across ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to exclude the potential influence of the APOE-ε2 allele. This cohort study included 4592 individuals (mean [SD] age, 70.8 [10.2] years; 2425 [52.8%] female; 119 [2.6%] African, 52 [1.1%] Asian, and 4421 [96.3%] European). Higher APOE-ε4 dosage scores were associated with lower Aβ42 values (β [SE], -0.58 [0.02], P < .001), indicating more severe pathology; these associations were seen in men and women separately and jointly. The association with APOE-ε4 was statistically greater in men (β [SE], -0.63 [0.03]; P < .001) vs women (β [SE], -0.52 [0.03]; P < .001) of European ancestry (P = .01 for interaction). Women had higher levels of p-tau, indicating more severe neurofibrillary pathology. The association between APOE-ε4 dosage and p-tau was in the expected direction (higher APOE-ε4 dosage for higher p-tau values) in both sexes, but the difference between sexes was significant only in those of African ancestry (β [SE], 0.10 [0.18]; P = .57 for men; β [SE], 0.66 [0.17]; P < .001 for women; P = .03 for interaction). Women also had higher levels of total tau, indicating more neuronal damage. The association between APOE-ε4 dosage and total tau was stronger in women than in men in the African cohort (β [SE], 0.20 [0.22]; P = .36 for men and β [SE], 0.65 [0.22], P = .004 for women [P = .16 for interaction]) and European cohort (β [SE], 0.36 [0.03]; P < .001 in women and β [SE], 0.27 [0.03], P < .001 in men [P = .053 for interaction]); no significant associations were found in the Asian cohort. Sensitivity analysis excluding APOE-ε2 carriers yielded similar results. In this cohort study, the association of the APOE-ε4 risk allele with tau accumulation was higher in women than in men. These findings underscore the importance of considering sex differences in APOE-ε4's association with AD biomarkers and tau pathology mechanisms in AD. Although this study provides robust evidence of complex interplay between sex and APOE-ε4 for European ancestry, further research is needed to fully understand other ancestry differences.",Neurogenomics,age sex apolipoprotein e apoe strongest risk factors lateonset alzheimer disease ad role apoe ad varies sex ancestry association apoe ad biomarkers also varies across sex ancestry study systematically investigated sexspecific ancestry differences apoe cerebrospinal fluid csf biomarkers together resulting limited insights generalizability systematically investigate association sex apoe core csf biomarkers across ancestries cohort study examined csf biomarkers amyloid phosphorylated tau ptau total tau participants cohorts july march individuals grouped african asian european ancestries based genetic data data analyses conducted june november sex male female apoe associations sex apoe biomarker levels assessed within ancestry group adjusting age metaanalyses performed identify associations across ancestries sensitivity analyses conducted exclude potential influence apoe allele cohort study included individuals mean sd age years female african asian european higher apoe dosage scores associated lower values se p indicating severe pathology associations seen men women separately jointly association apoe statistically greater men se p vs women se p european ancestry p interaction women higher levels ptau indicating severe neurofibrillary pathology association apoe dosage ptau expected direction higher apoe dosage higher ptau values sexes difference sexes significant african ancestry se p men se p women p interaction women also higher levels total tau indicating neuronal damage association apoe dosage total tau stronger women men african cohort se p men se p women p interaction european cohort se p women se p men p interaction significant associations found asian cohort sensitivity analysis excluding apoe carriers yielded similar results cohort study association apoe risk allele tau accumulation higher women men findings underscore importance considering sex differences apoes association ad biomarkers tau pathology mechanisms ad although study provides robust evidence complex interplay sex apoe european ancestry research needed fully understand ancestry differences,Neurogenomics
"Brain network dysfunction, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), is an increasingly apparent contributor to the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can target key DMN hubs, maintain signaling function, and delay or improve clinical outcomes in AD. Here, we present the rationale and design of a study using off-the-shelf equipment and the latest clinical evidence to expand on prior rTMS work and reduce participant burden in the process. We will conduct a two-stage trial of large-coil rTMS targeting the precuneus (a key hub in the DMN affected by AD) in 54 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Clinical Syndrome focused primarily on determining tolerability and feasibility and secondarily focused on determining short-term efficacy for memory. The first stage will involve 5 to 10 participants receiving open-label active treatment to refine the protocol. The following second stage will consist of a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial to study feasibility and tolerability while exploring target engagement and short-term efficacy for memory. Participants will undergo 16 total rTMS brain stimulation sessions over the course of 5 weeks. A full course of open-label active treatment will be offered as an extension to the sham group after unblinding. Outcomes will focus on completion rates and adverse events to demonstrate feasibility and tolerability. Further exploratory outcomes will include neuropsychological assessments, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers to demonstrate the feasibility of collection and explore preliminary changes in these measures. We anticipate this treatment is feasible and tolerable and may show evidence of target engagement and clinical improvement. Should we achieve expected positive outcomes in feasibility and tolerability, this will justify future work focusing on clear demonstrations of clinical efficacy and biomarker engagement, as well as enhancement of generalizability and scalability. Induction-to-maintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the precuneus is a promising treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), though recent methods require intensive personalization.We propose here a trial design of precuneus rTMS in mild-to-early-moderate AD dementia using exclusively off-the-shelf equipment and protocol modifications to reduce participant burden.Our two novel modifications from prior work are (1) using a larger rTMS coil, and (2) consolidating the induction phase of treatment.This trial focuses primarily on tolerability and feasibility while exploring clinical measures of efficacy and biomarkers of target engagement.Our trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06597942.",Neurogenomics,brain network dysfunction particularly within default mode network dmn increasingly apparent contributor clinical progression alzheimers disease ad repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms target key dmn hubs maintain signaling function delay improve clinical outcomes ad present rationale design study using offtheshelf equipment latest clinical evidence expand prior rtms work reduce participant burden process conduct twostage trial largecoil rtms targeting precuneus key hub dmn affected ad participants mild moderate alzheimers clinical syndrome focused primarily determining tolerability feasibility secondarily focused determining shortterm efficacy memory first stage involve participants receiving openlabel active treatment refine protocol following second stage consist randomized doubleblind shamcontrolled clinical trial study feasibility tolerability exploring target engagement shortterm efficacy memory participants undergo total rtms brain stimulation sessions course weeks full course openlabel active treatment offered extension sham group unblinding outcomes focus completion rates adverse events demonstrate feasibility tolerability exploratory outcomes include neuropsychological assessments electroencephalography neuroimaging blood biomarkers demonstrate feasibility collection explore preliminary changes measures anticipate treatment feasible tolerable may show evidence target engagement clinical improvement achieve expected positive outcomes feasibility tolerability justify future work focusing clear demonstrations clinical efficacy biomarker engagement well enhancement generalizability scalability inductiontomaintenance repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms precuneus promising treatment alzheimers disease ad though recent methods require intensive personalizationwe propose trial design precuneus rtms mildtoearlymoderate ad dementia using exclusively offtheshelf equipment protocol modifications reduce participant burdenour two novel modifications prior work using larger rtms coil consolidating induction phase treatmentthis trial focuses primarily tolerability feasibility exploring clinical measures efficacy biomarkers target engagementour trial registered clinicaltrialsgov nct,Neurogenomics
"Elevated low-frequency activity (4-12 Hz) within the globus pallidus internus (GPi) has been consistently associated with dystonia. However, the impacts of the genetic etiology of dystonia on low-frequency GPi activity remain unclear; yet it holds importance for adaptive deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment. We compared the properties of GPi electrophysiology acquired from 70 microelectrode recordings (MER) trajectories of DYT-GNAL, DYT-KMT2B, DYT-SGCE, DYT-THAP1, DYT-TOR1A, DYT-VPS16, and idiopathic dystonia (iDYT) patients who underwent GPi-DBS surgery across standard frequency bands. DYT-SGCE patients exhibited significantly lower alpha band activity (2.97%) compared to iDYT (4.44%, p = 0.006) and DYT-THAP1 (4.51%, p = 0.011). Additionally, theta band power was also significantly reduced in DYT-SGCE (4.42%) compared to iDYT and DYT-THAP1 (7.91% and 7.00%, p < 0.05). Instead, the genetic etiology of dystonia did not affect the spatial characteristics of GPi electrophysiology along MER trajectories. Considering the genetic etiology of dystonia in closed-loop DBS treatments and utilizing theta and alpha activity for GPi stimulation may optimize clinical outcomes.

"Brain function requires precise spatiotemporal regulation of the neuronal proteome. To allow adaptation of the proteome in distal outposts of neurons, mRNAs are transported into neurites for localized translation. This mRNA localization and local translation is crucial for neuron function and maintenance, and dysregulation of these processes can contribute to neurological disease. Recently, organelles have emerged as key players in regulating mRNA localization and local translation in dendrites and axons. In this review, we discuss the current evidence and open questions for this organelle-mediated mRNA localization. We highlight an emerging model in which multiple organelles create and orchestrate a subcellular microenvironment that can support precise mRNA localization and selective translation. This seems essential for maintaining organellar and neuronal function and health, as mutations in many of the involved proteins lead to various neurological disorders.",Neurogenomics,brain function requires precise spatiotemporal regulation neuronal proteome allow adaptation proteome distal outposts neurons mrnas transported neurites localized translation mrna localization local translation crucial neuron function maintenance dysregulation processes contribute neurological disease recently organelles emerged key players regulating mrna localization local translation dendrites axons review discuss current evidence open questions organellemediated mrna localization highlight emerging model multiple organelles create orchestrate subcellular microenvironment support precise mrna localization selective translation seems essential maintaining organellar neuronal function health mutations many involved proteins lead various neurological disorders,Neurogenomics
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies utilizing amyloid-β (Aβ) immunization have shown potential in clinical trials. Yet, the mechanisms driving Aβ clearance in the immunized AD brain remain unclear. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to explore the effects of both active and passive Aβ immunization in the AD brain. We compare actively immunized patients with AD with nonimmunized patients with AD and neurologically healthy controls, identifying distinct microglial states associated with Aβ clearance. Using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics alongside single-cell RNA sequencing, we delve deeper into the transcriptional pathways involved in Aβ removal after lecanemab treatment. We uncover spatially distinct microglial responses that vary by brain region. Our analysis reveals upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in microglia across immunization approaches, which correlate positively with antibody responses and Aβ removal. Furthermore, we show that complement signaling in brain myeloid cells contributes to Aβ clearance after immunization. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating Aβ removal and shed light on the role of microglia in immune-mediated Aβ clearance. Importantly, our work uncovers potential molecular targets that could enhance Aβ-targeted immunotherapies, offering new avenues for developing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat AD.",Neurogenomics,alzheimers disease ad therapies utilizing amyloid immunization shown potential clinical trials yet mechanisms driving clearance immunized ad brain remain unclear use spatial transcriptomics explore effects active passive immunization ad brain compare actively immunized patients ad nonimmunized patients ad neurologically healthy controls identifying distinct microglial states associated clearance using highresolution spatial transcriptomics alongside singlecell rna sequencing delve deeper transcriptional pathways involved removal lecanemab treatment uncover spatially distinct microglial responses vary brain region analysis reveals upregulation triggering receptor expressed myeloid cells trem apolipoprotein e apoe microglia across immunization approaches correlate positively antibody responses removal furthermore show complement signaling brain myeloid cells contributes clearance immunization findings provide new insights transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating removal shed light role microglia immunemediated clearance importantly work uncovers potential molecular targets could enhance atargeted immunotherapies offering new avenues developing effective therapeutic strategies combat ad,Neurogenomics
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to optimize personalized treatment tools and enhance clinical decision-making. However, biases in AI, arising from sex, race, socioeconomic status (SES), and statistical methods, can exacerbate disparities in pain management. This narrative review examines these biases and proposes strategies to mitigate them. A comprehensive literature search across databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO focused on AI applications in pain management and sources of biases. Sex and racial biases often stem from societal stereotypes, underrepresentation of females, overrepresentation of European ancestry patients in clinical trials, and unequal access to treatment caused by systemic racism, leading to inaccurate pain assessments and misrepresentation in clinical data. SES biases reflect differential access to healthcare resources and incomplete data for lower SES individuals, resulting in larger prediction errors. Statistical biases, including sampling and measurement biases, further affect the reliability of AI algorithms. To ensure equitable healthcare delivery, this review recommends employing specific fairness-aware techniques such as reweighting algorithms, adversarial debiasing, and other methods that adjust training data to minimize bias. Additionally, leveraging diverse perspectives-including insights from patients, clinicians, policymakers, and interdisciplinary collaborators-can enhance the development of fair and interpretable AI systems. Continuous monitoring and inclusive collaboration are essential for addressing biases and harnessing AI's potential to improve pain management outcomes across diverse populations.",Neurogenomics,artificial intelligence ai potential optimize personalized treatment tools enhance clinical decisionmaking however biases ai arising sex race socioeconomic status ses statistical methods exacerbate disparities pain management narrative review examines biases proposes strategies mitigate comprehensive literature search across databases pubmed google scholar psycinfo focused ai applications pain management sources biases sex racial biases often stem societal stereotypes underrepresentation females overrepresentation european ancestry patients clinical trials unequal access treatment caused systemic racism leading inaccurate pain assessments misrepresentation clinical data ses biases reflect differential access healthcare resources incomplete data lower ses individuals resulting larger prediction errors statistical biases including sampling measurement biases affect reliability ai algorithms ensure equitable healthcare delivery review recommends employing specific fairnessaware techniques reweighting algorithms adversarial debiasing methods adjust training data minimize bias additionally leveraging diverse perspectivesincluding insights patients clinicians policymakers interdisciplinary collaboratorscan enhance development fair interpretable ai systems continuous monitoring inclusive collaboration essential addressing biases harnessing ais potential improve pain management outcomes across diverse populations,Neurogenomics

"Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system, have been genetically implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Mapping the genetics of gene expression in human microglia has identified several loci associated with disease-associated genetic variants in microglia-specific regulatory elements. However, identifying genetic effects on splicing is challenging because of the use of short sequencing reads. Here, we present the isoform-centric microglia genomic atlas (isoMiGA), which leverages long-read RNA sequencing to identify 35,879 novel microglia isoforms. We show that these isoforms are involved in stimulation response and brain region specificity. We then quantified the expression of both known and novel isoforms in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 555 human microglia short-read RNA sequencing samples from 391 donors, and found associations with genetic risk loci in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a disorder that can result from pathogenic variants in ATP1A3-encoded sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase alpha 3 (ATP1A3). While AHC is primarily a neurologic disease, some individuals experience sudden unexplained death (SUD) potentially associated with cardiac arrhythmias. To determine the impact of ATP1A3 variants on cardiac electrophysiology and whether lethal ventricular arrhythmias are associated with SUD in patients with AHC. In this international, multicenter case-control study from 12 centers across 10 countries, patients with AHC were grouped by ATP1A3 variant status (positive vs negative) and into subgroups with the most common AHC variants (D801N, E815K, G947R, and other). A healthy control cohort was established for comparison. Blinded, manual measurements of QT intervals and corrected QT interval (QTc) were performed independently by 2 pediatric cardiac electrophysiologists. Induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes were derived from patients with AHC who were positive for the D801N variant of ATP1A3 (iPSC-CMD801N cells). Data analysis was performed from April to June 2022. Presence of ATP1A3 variant. The primary outcome was QTc. Outcomes, including survival, were abstracted and variants were mapped on cryogenic electron microscopy structure maps. iPSC-CMD801N cells were used to validate ventricular repolarization and arrhythmic susceptibility in vitro. Among the 222 individuals included (148 with AHC and 74 control), the mean (SD) age at diagnostic electrocardiography was 11.0 (9.4) years and 119 (54%) were female. The cohort with AHC consisted of 148 largely unrelated probands (mean [SD] age at diagnostic electrocardiography, 11.5 [10.5] years). Of these, 123 individuals were ATP1A3 genotype positive, including 35 (28%) with the D801N variant, 21 (17%) with the E815K variant, 8 (7%) with the G947R variant, and 8 (7%) with a loss-of-function variant. Probands with the D801N variant had shorter mean (SD) QTcs (381.8 [36.6] milliseconds; 24 [69%] with QTc <370 milliseconds) compared with those who had the E815K variant (393.6 [43.1] milliseconds; P = .001; 4 [19%] with QTC <370 milliseconds), the G947R variant (388.4 [26.5] milliseconds; P = .02; 1 [13%] with QTc <370 milliseconds), a loss-of-function variant (403.0 [33.5] milliseconds; P < .001; 1 [13%] with QTc <370 milliseconds), all other variants (387.8 [37.1] milliseconds; P < .001; 44 [86%] with QTc <370 milliseconds), and healthy controls (415.4 [21.0] milliseconds; P < .001; 0 with QTc <370 milliseconds).

"Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are considered one of the most significant impediments to the translation of genetic test results into precise clinical recommendations. The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) classification guidelines established a general framework for the assessment and classification of genetic variants; yet, gene-specific specifications are needed to enable better variant classification to reduce the number of VUS. The process of gene-specific adaptations of the ACMG/AMP codes is led and accompanied by ClinGen and implemented by Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEP). The Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) VCEP recently published its specifications for the <i>BRCA1</i> (HGNC:1100) and <i>BRCA2</i> (HGNC:1101) genes. We investigated the differences in reclassification between the ENIGMA specifications and the standard ACMG/AMP classification system in a clinical setting. We reclassified 121 VUS identified in these genes with the latest annotation data using the standard ACMG/AMP classification system and recommendations from the Sequence Variant Interpretation and the ENIGMA specifications. To simplify the reevaluation process, we have created a University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser track hub that displays the exact data points required for variant classification using the ENIGMA VCEP specifications at the exon and variant level (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/abenet/BRCA.ENIGMA.hg19). By comparing the codes used and their different weighting in the 2 approaches, we were able to demonstrate the superiority of the application of ENIGMA VCEP specifications, which resulted in a dramatic reduction of VUS (83.5% ENIGMA VCEP vs 20% ACMG/AMP + Sequence Variant Interpretation). For the diagnostic analysis of the <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes, the use of the ENIGMA VCEP specifications gives the best possible result in the clinical translation of genetic variants.

"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prevalence has increased in the last 10 years, most likely due to increased recognition by clinicians. Even so, an issue with under-diagnostics may persist. Historically ADHD has been described as a male-dominant disorder. However, recent evidence shows that ADHD prevalence is similar between the sexes, but that the related impairment or symptomatology might vary. This study estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed ADHD symptoms (pADHD) and explored the sex-stratified symptomatology and associations with self-perceived health-related quality of life (HRQL) and experience of depressive symptoms. This was done in a unique cohort of 50,937 healthy blood donors - individuals who successfully maintain regular commitments despite potential ADHD symptoms. ADHD symptoms were estimated using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), health-related quality of life (HRQL) measured using mental and physical component scores (MCS/PCS) estimated based on a 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) with a higher score indicating better HRQL, and depressive symptoms were measured using Major Depression Inventory (MDI) with higher score indicating more depressive symptoms. In total, 3% were classified with pADHD (sex ratio 1:1). pADHD was associated with reduced MCS and PCS, and increased MDI score. Males scored on average higher on inattentive symptoms compared to females, whereas females scored on average higher on hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.

"Sensory trade-offs between vision and olfaction in the evolution and radiation of primates have long been debated. However, insights have been limited by a lack of sensory gene sequences and accompanying functional predictions. Here we conduct large-scale functional analyses of visual and olfactory receptors and related brain regions across extant primates. Our results reveal a visual shift from ultraviolet to violet colour sensitivity in early haplorrhine primates, followed by acceleration in the rhodopsin retinal release rates at the origin of anthropoids, both of which are expected to greatly enhance visual acuity under brighter light conditions. Additionally, we find that the sensitivity of olfactory receptors shifted from narrowly to broadly tuned early in anthropoid evolution. In contrast, strepsirrhines appear to have retained sensitive dim-light vision and underwent functional enhancement of narrowly tuned olfactory receptors. Our models indicate that this would have enhanced odorant discrimination and facilitated olfaction-mediated physiology and behaviour. These differences in tuning patterns of olfactory receptors between major primate lineages mirror well-established morphological differences in external anatomy and brain structures, revealing new mechanisms of olfactory adaptation and evolutionary plasticity. Our multisystem analyses reveal patterns of co-evolution in genomic, molecular and neuroanatomical traits that are consistent with a sensory 'reallocation' rather than strict trade-offs.",Neurogenomics,sensory tradeoffs vision olfaction evolution radiation primates long debated however insights limited lack sensory gene sequences accompanying functional predictions conduct largescale functional analyses visual olfactory receptors related brain regions across extant primates results reveal visual shift ultraviolet violet colour sensitivity early haplorrhine primates followed acceleration rhodopsin retinal release rates origin anthropoids expected greatly enhance visual acuity brighter light conditions additionally find sensitivity olfactory receptors shifted narrowly broadly tuned early anthropoid evolution contrast strepsirrhines appear retained sensitive dimlight vision underwent functional enhancement narrowly tuned olfactory receptors models indicate would enhanced odorant discrimination facilitated olfactionmediated physiology behaviour differences tuning patterns olfactory receptors major primate lineages mirror wellestablished morphological differences external anatomy brain structures revealing new mechanisms olfactory adaptation evolutionary plasticity multisystem analyses reveal patterns coevolution genomic molecular neuroanatomical traits consistent sensory reallocation rather strict tradeoffs,Neurogenomics
"Disorder-related variants in the STXBP1 gene are increasingly detected in children with severe developmental disorders. It is commonly acknowledged that developmental disorders significantly impact family life, but little is known about the day-to-day experiences of caregivers living with children with STXBP1-related disorders (STXBP1-RD). This knowledge gap may hinder researchers and care professionals from aligning research activities, care, and support with the perspectives of parents. We conducted a semi-structured interview study to gain a better understanding of the impact of having a child with STXBP1-RD on daily family life. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. We developed an 'analytical framework based on verbs', as verbs signify action, to present our results on the experiences of parents in everyday life. We conducted 16 interviews with 21 parents of children with STXBP1-RD (2 to 18 years old), living in the Netherlands. The respondents described their caregiving responsibilities as extremely intense and demanding. They reported being constantly occupied with caring for their child, and expressed a feeling of always being 'switched on'. Parents' experiences are described using the following five verbs: (1) caring for their child, (2) recognizing their child's needs and having their child's needs recognized, (3) searching for answers and suitable care, (4) balancing delivering care while preserving other domains of life, and (5) coping with emotional impacts. This study shows how parenting a child with STXBP1-RD involves continuous engagement with both child-related care responsibilities and other activities, such as arranging suitable care and coping with emotional impacts. The accumulation of these responsibilities and challenges significantly impacts the everyday lives of the entire family. To support STXBP1 patient families, a broad approach is needed, focusing not only on developing new medical treatments, but also on improving other therapies (e.g., speech therapy or physiotherapy) and providing social support for the entire family, including emotional support, assistance with administrative tasks, and improved information provision after diagnosis.",Neurogenomics,disorderrelated variants stxbp gene increasingly detected children severe developmental disorders commonly acknowledged developmental disorders significantly impact family life little known daytoday experiences caregivers living children stxbprelated disorders stxbprd knowledge gap may hinder researchers care professionals aligning research activities care support perspectives parents conducted semistructured interview study gain better understanding impact child stxbprd daily family life interviews audiorecorded transcribed analyzed thematically developed analytical framework based verbs verbs signify action present results experiences parents everyday life conducted interviews parents children stxbprd years old living netherlands respondents described caregiving responsibilities extremely intense demanding reported constantly occupied caring child expressed feeling always switched parents experiences described using following five verbs caring child recognizing childs needs childs needs recognized searching answers suitable care balancing delivering care preserving domains life coping emotional impacts study shows parenting child stxbprd involves continuous engagement childrelated care responsibilities activities arranging suitable care coping emotional impacts accumulation responsibilities challenges significantly impacts everyday lives entire family support stxbp patient families broad approach needed focusing developing new medical treatments also improving therapies eg speech therapy physiotherapy providing social support entire family including emotional support assistance administrative tasks improved information provision diagnosis,Neurogenomics
"Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Delivery of biosynthetic lysosomal proteins to lysosomes is crucial to orchestrate proper lysosomal function. However, it remains unknown how the delivery of biosynthetic lysosomal proteins to lysosomes is ensured in neurons, which are highly polarized cells. Here, we developed Protein Origin, Trafficking And Targeting to Organelle Mapping (POTATOMap), by combining trafficking synchronization and proximity-labelling based proteomics, to unravel the trafficking routes and interactome of the biosynthetic lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 at specified time points. This approach, combined with advanced microscopy, enables us to identify the neuronal domain-specific trafficking machineries of biosynthetic LAMP1. We reveal a role in replenishing axonal lysosomes, in delivery of newly synthesized axonal synaptic proteins, and interactions with RNA granules to facilitate hitchhiking in the axon.

"The majority of exercise physiology research has been conducted in males, resulting in a skewed biological representation of how exercise impacts the physiological system. Extrapolating male-centric physiological findings to females is not universally appropriate and may even be detrimental. Thus, addressing this imbalance and taking into consideration sex as a biological variable is mandatory for optimization of precision exercise interventions and/or regimens. Our present analysis focused on establishing multiomic profiles in young, exercise-naïve males (<i>n</i> = 23) and females (<i>n</i> = 17) at rest and following acute exercise. Sex differences were characterized at baseline and following exercise using skeletal muscle and extracellular vesicle transcriptomics, whole blood methylomics, and serum metabolomics. Sex-by-time analysis of the acute exercise response revealed notable overlap, and divergent molecular responses between males and females. An exploratory comparison of two combined exercise regimens [high-intensity tactical training (HITT) and traditional (TRAD)] was then performed using singular value decomposition, revealing latent data structures that suggest a complex dose-by-sex interaction response to exercise. These findings lay the groundwork for an understanding of key differences in responses to acute exercise exposure between sexes. This may be leveraged in designing optimal training strategies, understanding common and divergent molecular interplay guiding exercise responses, and elucidating the role of sex hormones and/or other sex-specific attributes in responses to acute and chronic exercise.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This study examined methylomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics in circulation and/or skeletal muscle of young, healthy, exercise-naïve males and females before and after exposure to either traditional combined exercise (TRAD) and high-intensity tactical training (HITT).

"Asthma, a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation, affects millions of individuals worldwide. Challenges remain in asthma prediction and diagnosis from its complex etiology involving genetic and environmental factors. Here, we investigated the relationship between genome-wide DNA methylation and genetic risk for asthma quantified via polygenic scores in two cohorts from the Netherlands Twin Register; one enriched with asthmatic families measured on the Illumina EPIC array (n = 526) and a general population cohort measured on the Illumina HM450K array (n = 2680). We performed epigenome-wide association studies of asthma polygenic scores in each cohort with results combined through meta-analysis (total samples = 3206). The EWAS meta-analysis identified 63 significantly associated CpGs, (following Bonferroni correction, α = 0.05/358,316). An investigation of previous mQTL associations identified 48 mQTL associations between 24 unique CpGs and 48 SNPs, of which two SNPs have previous associations with asthma. Enrichment analysis using the 63 significant CpGs highlighted previous associations with ancestry, smoking, and air pollution. A dizygotic twin within-pair analysis of the 63 CpGs revealed similar directional effects between the two cohorts in 33 of the 63 CpGs. These findings further characterize the intricate relationship between DNA methylation and genetics relative to asthma.",Neurogenomics,asthma chronic respiratory condition characterized airway inflammation affects millions individuals worldwide challenges remain asthma prediction diagnosis complex etiology involving genetic environmental factors investigated relationship genomewide dna methylation genetic risk asthma quantified via polygenic scores two cohorts netherlands twin register one enriched asthmatic families measured illumina epic array n general population cohort measured illumina hmk array n performed epigenomewide association studies asthma polygenic scores cohort results combined metaanalysis total samples ewas metaanalysis identified significantly associated cpgs following bonferroni correction investigation previous mqtl associations identified mqtl associations unique cpgs snps two snps previous associations asthma enrichment analysis using significant cpgs highlighted previous associations ancestry smoking air pollution dizygotic twin withinpair analysis cpgs revealed similar directional effects two cohorts cpgs findings characterize intricate relationship dna methylation genetics relative asthma,Neurogenomics
"This study tests the association of whole-blood DNA methylation and antidepressant exposure in 16,531 individuals from Generation Scotland (GS), using self-report and prescription-derived measures. We identify 8 associations and a high concordance of results between self-report and prescription-derived measures. Sex-stratified analyses observe nominally significant increased effect estimates in females for four CpGs. There is observed enrichment for genes expressed in the Amygdala and annotated to synaptic vesicle membrane ontology. Two CpGs (cg15071067; DGUOK-AS1 and cg26277237; KANK1) show correlation between DNA methylation with the time in treatment. There is a significant overlap in the top 1% of CpGs with another independent methylome-wide association study of antidepressant exposure. Finally, a methylation profile score trained on this sample shows a significant association with antidepressant exposure in a meta-analysis of eight independent external datasets.

"As the world's population ages, more and more people are expected to suffer from age-related diseases. Biological aging markers derived from DNA methylation and brain structure show promise in predicting health outcomes. Understanding the relationship between these biomarkers can promote the development of effective health interventions. In a sample of 254 participants from the Netherlands Twin Register (20-84 years), we investigated associations between DNA methylation age acceleration based on five epigenetic biomarkers (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and DunedinPACE) and brain age acceleration based on neuroimaging (brainageR). Furthermore, we applied bivariate twin models to examine the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the associations (cross-twin cross-trait correlations and within monozygotic-twin pair differences). We observed relationships with brain age acceleration for DNA methylation age acceleration based on the Hannum and GrimAge clocks that were supported by within MZ twin pair difference modelling. Cross-twin cross-trait modelling confirmed a non-shared environmental etiology.

"Mutations and multiplications in the SNCA <i>gene</i>, encoding alpha-synuclein (aSyn), are associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). We report the identification of a novel <i>SNCA</i> missense mutation (NM_000345.4, cDNA 174G>C; protein K58N) in a PD patient using whole exome sequencing, and describe comprehensive molecular and cellular analysss of the effects of this novel mutation. The patient exhibited typical sporadic PD with early onset and a benign disease course. Biophysical studies revealed that the K58N substitution causes local structural effects, disrupts binding to membranes, and enhances aSyn in vitro aggregation. K58N aSyn produces fewer inclusions per cell, and fails to undergo condensate formation. The mutation increases the cytoplasmic distribution of the protein, and has minimal effect on the dynamic reversibility of serine-129 phosphorylation.

"Through the agnostic screening of patients with uncharacterised disease phenotypes for an upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) signalling, we identified a cohort of individuals heterozygous for mutations in PTPN1, encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). We aimed to describe the clinical phenotype and molecular and cellular pathology of this new disease. In this case series, we identified patients and collected clinical and neuroradiological data through collaboration with paediatric neurology and clinical genetics colleagues across Europe (Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, and the UK) and Israel. Variants in PTPN1 were identified by exome and directed Sanger sequencing. The expression of IFN-stimulated genes was determined by quantitative (q) PCR or NanoString technology. Experiments to assess RNA and protein expression and to investigate type 1 IFN signalling were undertaken in patient fibroblasts, hTERT-immortalised BJ-5ta fibroblasts, and RPE-1 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 editing and standard cell biology techniques. Between Dec 20, 2013, and Jan 11, 2023, we identified 12 patients from 11 families who were heterozygous for mutations in PTPN1. We found ten novel or very rare variants in PTPN1 (frequency on gnomAD version 4.1.0 of <1·25 × 10:sup>-6). Six variants were predicted as STOP mutations, two involved canonical splice-site nucleotides, and two were missense substitutions. In three patients, the variant occurred de novo, whereas in nine affected individuals, the variant was inherited from an asymptomatic parent. The clinical phenotype was characterised by the subacute onset (age range 1-8 years) of loss of motor and language skills in the absence of seizures after initially normal development, leading to spastic dystonia and bulbar involvement. Neuroimaging variably demonstrated cerebral atrophy (sometimes unilateral initially) or high T2 white matter signal. Neopterin in CSF was elevated in all ten patients who were tested, and all probands demonstrated an upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes in whole blood. Although clinical stabilisation and neuroradiological improvement was seen in both treated and untreated patients, in six of eight treated patients, high-dose corticosteroids were judged clinically to result in an improvement in neurological status. Of the four asymptomatic parents tested, IFN signalling in blood was normal (three patients) or minimally elevated (one patient). Analysis of patient blood and fibroblasts showed that tested PTPN1 variants led to reduced levels of PTPN1 mRNA and PTP1B protein, and in-vitro assays demonstrated that loss of PTP1B function was associated with impaired negative regulation of type 1 IFN signalling. PTPN1 haploinsufficiency causes a type 1 IFN-driven autoinflammatory encephalopathy. Notably, some patients demonstrated stabilisation, and even recovery, of neurological function in the absence of treatment, whereas in others, the disease appeared to be responsive to immune suppression. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of specific immune suppression approaches in this disease population.

"Investigate the immune system's role in cluster headache by analyzing cytokines in people with cluster headache and headache-free controls, and explore if certain cytokines could predict a specific phenotype. We measured 45 cytokines in adult participants from the Danish Cluster Headache Biobank in a prospective case-control setup. People with cluster headache were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders third-edition. Controls were matched for age and sex. A total of 412 were analyzed deriving from 99 with chronic cluster headache, 108 with episodic cluster headache (ECH) in bout, 105 with ECH in remission, and 100 successfully matched controls. Compared with controls, 13 cytokines were altered for ECH in bout (p < 0.05), 3 in remission (p < 0.05), and 10 for chronic cluster headache (p < 0.05). Oncostatin m was significantly elevated in all 3 disease states compared with controls (p < 0.05). Overall, the investigated cytokines showed distinct patterns of alterations between chronic cluster headache and episodic cluster headache in bout and, interestingly, IL-1β was significantly associated with having chronic cluster headache rather than episodic in bout in a logistic regression model adjusting for potential confounders (p < 0.05). Findings show that the immune system is altered in all 3 states of cluster headache compared with controls. Oncostatin m was elevated, constituting a promising target for future studies. The distinct alterations between episodic and chronic cluster headache are striking and urges further research of the immune system in cluster headache to better understand its potential role in prediction of disease activity and treatment response.

"Researchers commonly use counts of diagnostic codes from EHR-linked biobanks to infer phenotypic status. However, these approaches overlook temporal changes in EHR data, such as the discontinuation or ""dropout"" of diagnostic codes, which may exacerbate disparities in genomics research, as EHR data quality can be confounded with demographic attributes. To address this, we propose modeling diagnostic code dropout in EHR data to inform phenotyping for schizophrenia in genomic analyses. We develop and test our diagnostic dropout model by analyzing EHR data from individuals with prior schizophrenia diagnoses. We further validate model performance on a subset of patients whose diagnoses were attained through chart review. Using PRS-CS and existing GWAS summary statistics, we first extrapolate polygenic weights. Then, we apply our dropout model's outputs to construct a data-driven filter defining our target cohort for measuring polygenic score performance. Our analysis utilizes EHR and genomic data from the Million Veteran Program. To model diagnostic dropout in schizophrenia, we leverage data from 12,739 patients with a history of schizophrenia, after excluding outliers. For polygenic score analyses, we incorporate data from a potential pool of 8,385 European ancestry and 6,806 African ancestry patients with a history of schizophrenia. We compare the performance of our diagnostic dropout model with alternative methodologies both in predicting diagnostic dropout on a holdout set, as well as on chart review labeled data. Using the top differential diagnosis predictors in our model, we select relevant cases by filtering out patients with a prior history of mood or anxiety disorders. We then test the impact of applying different filters for measuring polygenic score performance. When evaluated on chart review-labeled data, our model improves the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 9.6% compared to competing methods. By applying our data-driven filter for schizophrenia, we achieve a 62% increase in the association effect size when transferring a European polygenic score to an African ancestry target cohort.

"We establish the natural history of pediatric-onset TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy to improve clinical trial readiness through a medical record-based longitudinal study. An international cohort of 216 individuals with pediatric-onset TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy was included. Demographic information and medical events were extracted from medical records or publications. Retrospective scores (Gross Motor Function - Metachromatic Leukodystrophy [GMFC-MLD] and Communication Function Classification System [CFCS]) were applied to assess function. Survival analysis distinguished differences in longitudinal neurocognitive function and time to event outcomes between subtypes. A decision tree predicted independent ambulation from early motor milestones. Genotype (p.Asp249Asn vs non-p.Asp249Asn) and independent sitting by age 9 months predicted ambulation by 3 years, and stratification into three subgroups: early-infantile (non- sitting by 9 months), late-infantile (normal early milestones without the common p.Asp249Asn mutation), and a cohort of p.Asp249Asn late-infantile onset individuals. Median age at symptom onset was 0.71 years (interquartile range: [0.33, 1.50]). Common symptoms at onset include delayed development and tone abnormalities (n = 125, 66.5 % and n = 77, 43.0 %). The most common medical complications included scoliosis (N = 51/142), hip dislocation (N = 30/101), and seizures (N = 51/163). The early-infantile more severely affected cohort had a greater prevalence of G-tube placement, scoliosis, and seizure compared to the late-infantile form (p < 0.01).

"The axon initial segment (AIS) is a highly specialized compartment in neurons that resides in between axonal and somatodendritic domains. The localization of the AIS in the proximal part of the axon is essential for its two major functions: generating and modulating action potentials and maintaining neuron polarity. Recent findings revealed that the incredibly stable AIS is generated from highly dynamic components and can undergo extensive structural and functional changes in response to alterations in activity levels. These activity-dependent alterations of AIS structure and function have profound consequences for neuronal functioning, and AIS plasticity has emerged as a key regulator of network homeostasis. This review highlights the functions of the AIS, its architecture, and how its organization and remodeling are influenced by developmental plasticity and both acute and chronic adaptations. It also discusses the mechanisms underlying these processes and explores how dysregulated AIS plasticity may contribute to brain disorders.",Neurogenomics,axon initial segment ais highly specialized compartment neurons resides axonal somatodendritic domains localization ais proximal part axon essential two major functions generating modulating action potentials maintaining neuron polarity recent findings revealed incredibly stable ais generated highly dynamic components undergo extensive structural functional changes response alterations activity levels activitydependent alterations ais structure function profound consequences neuronal functioning ais plasticity emerged key regulator network homeostasis review highlights functions ais architecture organization remodeling influenced developmental plasticity acute chronic adaptations also discusses mechanisms underlying processes explores dysregulated ais plasticity may contribute brain disorders,Neurogenomics
"Dravet syndrome is a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy associated with pathogenic variants in SCN1A. Most disease-causing variants are located within coding regions, but recent work has shed light on the role of noncoding variants associated with a poison exon in intron 20 of SCN1A. Discovery of the SCN1A poison exon known as 20N has led to the first potential disease-modifying therapy for Dravet syndrome in the form of an antisense oligonucleotide. Here, we demonstrate the existence of 2 additional poison exons in introns 1 and 22 of SCN1A through targeted, deep-coverage long-read sequencing of SCN1A transcripts. We show that inclusion of these poison exons is developmentally regulated in the human brain, and that deep intronic variants associated with these poison exons lead to their aberrant inclusion in vitro in a minigene assay or in iPSC-derived neurons. Additionally, we show that splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides can ameliorate aberrant inclusion of poison exons. Our findings highlight the role of deep intronic pathogenic variants in disease and provide additional therapeutic targets for precision medicine in Dravet syndrome and other SCN1A-related disorders.",Neurogenomics,dravet syndrome developmental epileptic encephalopathy associated pathogenic variants scna diseasecausing variants located within coding regions recent work shed light role noncoding variants associated poison exon intron scna discovery scna poison exon known n led first potential diseasemodifying therapy dravet syndrome form antisense oligonucleotide demonstrate existence additional poison exons introns scna targeted deepcoverage longread sequencing scna transcripts show inclusion poison exons developmentally regulated human brain deep intronic variants associated poison exons lead aberrant inclusion vitro minigene assay ipscderived neurons additionally show splicemodulating antisense oligonucleotides ameliorate aberrant inclusion poison exons findings highlight role deep intronic pathogenic variants disease provide additional therapeutic targets precision medicine dravet syndrome scnarelated disorders,Neurogenomics
"Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) gene cause the most common recessive type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), CMT-SORD. However, the full genotype-phenotype spectrum and progression of the disease remain to be defined. Notably, a multicenter phase 2/3 study to test the efficacy of govorestat (NCT05397665), a new aldose reductase inhibitor, is currently ongoing. Diagnosing CMT-SORD will become imperative when disease-modifying therapies become available. In this cross-sectional multicentre study, we identified 144 patients from 126 families, including 99 males (69%) and 45 females (31%). Patients represented multiple ancestries, including European, Hispanic, Chinese, Near Eastern, and Northern African. We confirmed c.757delG (p.Ala253GlnfsTer27) as the most common pathogenic allele, followed by c.458C>A (p.Ala153Asp), while other variants were identified mostly in single cases. The average sorbitol level in CMT-SORD patients was significantly higher compared to controls and heterozygous carriers, independently from serum storage duration, sex, or variant type. Two-thirds of cases were diagnosed with CMT2 while one-third had distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). Disease onset was usually in the second decade of life. Although foot dorsiflexion was the most affected muscle group, dorsal and plantar flexion had a similar degree of weakness in most cases (difference of Medical Research Council score ≤ 1). One fourth of patients used ankle foot orthoses, usually in their 30s, but most patients maintained independent ambulation later in life. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were suggestive of a motor predominant axonal neuropathy, with reduced conduction velocities in the intermediate range in one fourth of the cases. Sensory conductions in the upper limbs appeared more frequently affected than in the lower limbs. Foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion decreased significantly with age. Male sex was significantly associated with the severity of distal lower limb weakness (plantar flexion) and a larger change over time (dorsiflexion). In conclusion, CMT-SORD is a frequent recessive form of axonal, motor predominant CMT, with prominent foot dorsiflexion and plantar flexion involvement. Fasting serum sorbitol is a reliable biomarker of the condition that can be utilized for pathogenicity assessment of identified rare SORD variants.",Neurogenomics,biallelic lossoffunction mutations sorbitol dehydrogenase sord gene cause common recessive type charcotmarietooth disease cmt cmtsord however full genotypephenotype spectrum progression disease remain defined notably multicenter phase study test efficacy govorestat nct new aldose reductase inhibitor currently ongoing diagnosing cmtsord become imperative diseasemodifying therapies become available crosssectional multicentre study identified patients families including males females patients represented multiple ancestries including european hispanic chinese near eastern northern african confirmed cdelg palaglnfster common pathogenic allele followed cca palaasp variants identified mostly single cases average sorbitol level cmtsord patients significantly higher compared controls heterozygous carriers independently serum storage duration sex variant type twothirds cases diagnosed cmt onethird distal hereditary motor neuropathy dhmn disease onset usually second decade life although foot dorsiflexion affected muscle group dorsal plantar flexion similar degree weakness cases difference medical research council score one fourth patients used ankle foot orthoses usually patients maintained independent ambulation later life nerve conduction studies ncs suggestive motor predominant axonal neuropathy reduced conduction velocities intermediate range one fourth cases sensory conductions upper limbs appeared frequently affected lower limbs foot dorsiflexion plantar flexion decreased significantly age male sex significantly associated severity distal lower limb weakness plantar flexion larger change time dorsiflexion conclusion cmtsord frequent recessive form axonal motor predominant cmt prominent foot dorsiflexion plantar flexion involvement fasting serum sorbitol reliable biomarker condition utilized pathogenicity assessment identified rare sord variants,Neurogenomics
"Dystonia is a rare-disease trait for which large-scale genomic investigations are still underrepresented. Genetic heterogeneity among patients with unexplained dystonia warrants interrogation of entire genome sequences, but this has not yet been systematically evaluated. To significantly enhance our understanding of the genetic contribution to dystonia, we (re)analyzed 2,874 whole-exome sequencing (WES), 564 whole-genome sequencing (WGS), as well as 80 fibroblast-derived proteomics datasets, representing the output of high-throughput analyses in 1,990 patients and 973 unaffected relatives from 1,877 families. Recruitment and precision-phenotyping procedures were driven by long-term collaborations of international experts with access to overlooked populations. By exploring WES data, we found that continuous scaling of sample sizes resulted in steady gains in the number of associated disease genes without plateauing. On average, every second diagnosis involved a gene not previously implicated in our cohort. Second-line WGS focused on a subcohort of undiagnosed individuals with high likelihood of having monogenic forms of dystonia, comprising large proportions of patients with early onset (81.3%), generalized symptom distribution (50.8%) and/or coexisting features (68.9%). We undertook extensive searches for variants in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to uncover 38 (ultra)rare diagnostic-grade findings in 37 of 305 index patients (12.1%), many of which had remained undetected due to methodological inferiority of WES or pipeline limitations. WGS-identified elusive variations included alterations in exons poorly covered by WES, RNA-gene variants, mitochondrial-DNA mutations, small copy-number variants, complex rearranged genome structure, and short tandem repeats. For improved variant interpretation in WGS-inconclusive cases, we employed systematic integration of quantitative proteomics. This aided in verifying diagnoses related to technically challenging variants and in upgrading a variant of uncertain significance (3 of 70 WGS-inconclusive index patients, 4.3%). Further, unsupervised proteomic outlier-analysis supplemented with transcriptome sequencing revealed pathological gene underexpression induced by transcript disruptions in three more index patients with underlying (deep) intronic variants (3/70, 4.3%), highlighting the potential for targeted antisense-oligonucleotide therapy development. Finally, trio-WGS prioritized a de-novo missense change in the candidate PRMT1, encoding a histone-methyltransferase. Data-sharing strategies supported the discovery of three distinct PRMT1 de-novo variants in four phenotypically similar patients, associated with loss-of-function effects in in-vitro assays. This work underscores the importance of continually expanding sequencing cohorts to characterize the extensive spectrum of gene aberrations in dystonia. We show that a pool of unresolved cases is amenable to WGS and complementary multi-omic studies, directing advanced etiopathological concepts and future diagnostic-practice workflows for dystonia.",Neurogenomics,dystonia raredisease trait largescale genomic investigations still underrepresented genetic heterogeneity among patients unexplained dystonia warrants interrogation entire genome sequences yet systematically evaluated significantly enhance understanding genetic contribution dystonia reanalyzed wholeexome sequencing wes wholegenome sequencing wgs well fibroblastderived proteomics datasets representing output highthroughput analyses patients unaffected relatives families recruitment precisionphenotyping procedures driven longterm collaborations international experts access overlooked populations exploring wes data found continuous scaling sample sizes resulted steady gains number associated disease genes without plateauing average every second diagnosis involved gene previously implicated cohort secondline wgs focused subcohort undiagnosed individuals high likelihood monogenic forms dystonia comprising large proportions patients early onset generalized symptom distribution andor coexisting features undertook extensive searches variants nuclear mitochondrial genomes uncover ultrarare diagnosticgrade findings index patients many remained undetected due methodological inferiority wes pipeline limitations wgsidentified elusive variations included alterations exons poorly covered wes rnagene variants mitochondrialdna mutations small copynumber variants complex rearranged genome structure short tandem repeats improved variant interpretation wgsinconclusive cases employed systematic integration quantitative proteomics aided verifying diagnoses related technically challenging variants upgrading variant uncertain significance wgsinconclusive index patients unsupervised proteomic outlieranalysis supplemented transcriptome sequencing revealed pathological gene underexpression induced transcript disruptions three index patients underlying deep intronic variants highlighting potential targeted antisenseoligonucleotide therapy development finally triowgs prioritized denovo missense change candidate prmt encoding histonemethyltransferase datasharing strategies supported discovery three distinct prmt denovo variants four phenotypically similar patients associated lossoffunction effects invitro assays work underscores importance continually expanding sequencing cohorts characterize extensive spectrum gene aberrations dystonia show pool unresolved cases amenable wgs complementary multiomic studies directing advanced etiopathological concepts future diagnosticpractice workflows dystonia,Neurogenomics
"Variable expressivity is an emerging characteristic of KMT2B-related dystonia. However, it remains poorly understood whether variants reoccurring at specific sites of lysine-specific methlytransferase-2B (KMT2B) can drive intra- and interfamilial clinical heterogeneity. Our goal was to ascertain independent families with variants affecting residue Arg2565 of KMT2B. Whole-exome/genome sequencing, multi-site recruitment, genotype-phenotype correlations, and DNA methylation episignature analysis were performed. We report four individuals from two families harboring the variant c.7693C > G, p.Arg2565Gly. In an additional patient, a de-novo c.7693C > T, p.Arg2565Cys variant was identified. The observed phenotypic spectrum ranged from childhood-onset dystonia (N = 2) over unspecific intellectual disability syndromes (N = 2) to undiagnosed behavioral symptoms in adulthood (N = 1). Samples bearing p.Arg2565Gly had a KMT2B-typical episignature, although the effect on methylation was less pronounced than in carriers of loss-of-function KMT2B variants. We established the existence of a KMT2B missense-mutation hotspot associated with varying degrees of disease severity and expression, providing information for patient counseling and elucidation of pathomechanisms.",Neurogenomics,variable expressivity emerging characteristic kmtbrelated dystonia however remains poorly understood whether variants reoccurring specific sites lysinespecific methlytransferaseb kmtb drive intra interfamilial clinical heterogeneity goal ascertain independent families variants affecting residue arg kmtb wholeexomegenome sequencing multisite recruitment genotypephenotype correlations dna methylation episignature analysis performed report four individuals two families harboring variant cc g parggly additional patient denovo cc pargcys variant identified observed phenotypic spectrum ranged childhoodonset dystonia n unspecific intellectual disability syndromes n undiagnosed behavioral symptoms adulthood n samples bearing parggly kmtbtypical episignature although effect methylation less pronounced carriers lossoffunction kmtb variants established existence kmtb missensemutation hotspot associated varying degrees disease severity expression providing information patient counseling elucidation pathomechanisms,Neurogenomics
"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) yield large numbers of genetic loci associated with traits and diseases. Predicting the effector genes that mediate these locus-trait associations remains challenging. Here we present the FLAMES (fine-mapped locus assessment model of effector genes) framework, which predicts the most likely effector gene in a locus. FLAMES creates machine learning predictions from biological data linking single-nucleotide polymorphisms to genes, and then evaluates these scores together with gene-centric evidence of convergence of the GWAS signal in functional networks. We benchmark FLAMES on gene-locus pairs derived by expert curation, rare variant implication and domain knowledge of molecular traits. We demonstrate that combining single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based and convergence-based modalities outperforms prioritization strategies using a single line of evidence. Applying FLAMES, we resolve the FSHB locus in the GWAS for dizygotic twinning and further leverage this framework to find schizophrenia risk genes that converge with rare coding evidence and are relevant in different stages of life.",Neurogenomics,genomewide association studies gwas yield large numbers genetic loci associated traits diseases predicting effector genes mediate locustrait associations remains challenging present flames finemapped locus assessment model effector genes framework predicts likely effector gene locus flames creates machine learning predictions biological data linking singlenucleotide polymorphisms genes evaluates scores together genecentric evidence convergence gwas signal functional networks benchmark flames genelocus pairs derived expert curation rare variant implication domain knowledge molecular traits demonstrate combining singlenucleotidepolymorphismbased convergencebased modalities outperforms prioritization strategies using single line evidence applying flames resolve fshb locus gwas dizygotic twinning leverage framework find schizophrenia risk genes converge rare coding evidence relevant different stages life,Neurogenomics
"Within the last three decades, revolutions in genomics data generation and bioinformatics analysis techniques have profoundly impacted our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson's disease (PD). From the description of the first PD-associated risk gene in 1997 through today, new technologies have revolutionized approaches to identify genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in human health and disease. Spurred by the dramatically decreasing costs for genotyping, genome sequencing, and transcriptomics approaches, the ability to profile large cohorts of human populations or model organisms has accelerated the understanding of disease susceptibility, pathways, and genes. Thus far, ∼30 genetic loci have been unequivocally linked to the pathogenesis of PD, highlighting essential molecular pathways underlying this common disorder. More recently, the advent of single-cell transcriptomics techniques applied to human brain tissue has implicated cell-type-specific dysregulation and vulnerability (beyond the loss of dopaminergic neurons) in the disease.

"Amyloid-PET imaging tracks the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits in the brain. Amyloid plaques accumulation may begin 10 to 20 years before the individual experiences clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer's diseases (ad). Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies reported common risk factors associated with brain amyloidosis, suggesting that this endophenotype is driven by genetic variants. However, these loci pinpoint to large genomic regions and the functional variants remain to be identified. To identify new risk factors associated with brain amyloid deposition, we performed whole-genome sequencing on a large cohort of European descent individuals with amyloid PET imaging data (n = 1,888). Gene-based analysis for coding variants was performed using SKAT-O for amyloid PET as a quantitative endophenotype that identified genome-wide significant association for APOE (P = 2.45 × 10-10), and 26 new candidate genes with suggestive significance association (P < 5. 0 × 10-03) including SCN7A (P = 7.31 × 10-05), SH3GL1 (P = 7.56 × 10-04), and MFSD12 (P = 8.51 × 10-04).

"Learning enhances hippocampal engram cell synaptic connectivity which is crucial for engram reactivation and recall to natural cues. Memory retrieval engages only a subset of the learning-activated ensemble, indicating potential differences in synaptic connectivity signatures of reactivated and non-reactivated cells. We probed these differences in structural synaptic connectivity patterns after recent memory retrieval, 72 h after either neutral Context Exploration (CE) or aversive Contextual Fear Conditioning (CFC). Using a combination of eGRASP (enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reconstitution across synaptic partners) and viral-TRAP (targeted recombination in activated populations) to label CA3 synapses onto CA1 engram cells, we investigated differences in spine density, clusters, and morphology between the reactivated and non-reactivated population of the learning ensemble. In doing so, we developed a pipeline for reconstruction and analysis of dendrites and spines, taking nested data structure into account. Our data demonstrate an interplay between reactivation status, context valence or both factors on the number, distribution, and morphology of CA1 engram cell synapses. Despite a lack of differences in spine density, reactivated engram cells encoding an aversive context were characterised by a higher probability of forming spine clusters and a more dynamic spine type signature compared to their non-reactivated counterparts or engram cells encoding a neutral context. Together, our data indicate that the learning-activated ensemble undergoes different trajectories in structural synaptic connectivity during engram refinement.",Neurogenomics,learning enhances hippocampal engram cell synaptic connectivity crucial engram reactivation recall natural cues memory retrieval engages subset learningactivated ensemble indicating potential differences synaptic connectivity signatures reactivated nonreactivated cells probed differences structural synaptic connectivity patterns recent memory retrieval h either neutral context exploration ce aversive contextual fear conditioning cfc using combination egrasp enhanced green fluorescent protein gfp reconstitution across synaptic partners viraltrap targeted recombination activated populations label ca synapses onto ca engram cells investigated differences spine density clusters morphology reactivated nonreactivated population learning ensemble developed pipeline reconstruction analysis dendrites spines taking nested data structure account data demonstrate interplay reactivation status context valence factors number distribution morphology ca engram cell synapses despite lack differences spine density reactivated engram cells encoding aversive context characterised higher probability forming spine clusters dynamic spine type signature compared nonreactivated counterparts engram cells encoding neutral context together data indicate learningactivated ensemble undergoes different trajectories structural synaptic connectivity engram refinement,Neurogenomics
"Axon regeneration after injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is limited by an inhibitory environment but also because injured neurons fail to initiate expression of regeneration associated genes (RAGs). The potential of strong RAG expression to promote regeneration in the CNS is exemplified by the conditioning lesion model, whereby peripheral nerve injury promotes regeneration of centrally projecting branches of the injured neurons. RAG expression could potentially be induced by delivery of the right set of transcription factors (TFs). We here aim to identify TF combinations that activate this program. We first analysed binding site motifs in promoters of the RAG program to identify nine candidate growth-promoting TFs. These were systematically screened in vitro to identify combinations that had potent neurite-growth promoting activity. Next, adeno-associated viral vectors were used to express these TF combinations in vivo in L4/L5 dorsal root ganglia to test whether they would promote regeneration in a spinal cord injury model (dorsal column lesion) in female rats. To determine whether they could activate the RAG program we carried out gene expression profiling on laser-dissected dorsal root ganglion neurons specifically expressing these TF combinations, and of DRG neurons that had been axotomized. Promoter analysis identified ATF3, Jun, CEBPD, KLF7, MEF2, SMAD1, SOX11, STAT3 and SRF as candidate RAG-activating TFs. In vitro screening identified two TF combinations, KLF7/MEF2 and ATF3/KLF7/MEF2, that had potent neurite-growth promoting activity, the latter being the more powerful. In vivo, KLF7/MEF2, but not ATF3/KLF7/MEF2 or KLF7 or MEF2 alone, promoted axonal sprouting into the dorsal column lesion site and led to improved functional recovery. Gene expression profiling revealed that unexpectedly, the MEF2-VP16 construct used had little transcriptional activity in vivo, suggesting additional steps may be required to achieve full MEF2 activity. All combinations except MEF2 alone induced RAG expression mirroring that induced by axotomy to significant extents, while ATF3/KLF7/MEF2, KLF7 and ATF3, but not KLF7/MEF2 also induced apoptosis-related genes which may hinder regeneration. The TF combination KLF7/MEF2 partially mimics the conditioning lesion effect, inducing axonal sprouting into a dorsal column lesion and driving significant RAG expression, and also promotes functional improvement.",Neurogenomics,axon regeneration injury central nervous system cns limited inhibitory environment also injured neurons fail initiate expression regeneration associated genes rags potential strong rag expression promote regeneration cns exemplified conditioning lesion model whereby peripheral nerve injury promotes regeneration centrally projecting branches injured neurons rag expression could potentially induced delivery right set transcription factors tfs aim identify tf combinations activate program first analysed binding site motifs promoters rag program identify nine candidate growthpromoting tfs systematically screened vitro identify combinations potent neuritegrowth promoting activity next adenoassociated viral vectors used express tf combinations vivo dorsal root ganglia test whether would promote regeneration spinal cord injury model dorsal column lesion female rats determine whether could activate rag program carried gene expression profiling laserdissected dorsal root ganglion neurons specifically expressing tf combinations drg neurons axotomized promoter analysis identified atf jun cebpd klf mef smad sox stat srf candidate ragactivating tfs vitro screening identified two tf combinations klfmef atfklfmef potent neuritegrowth promoting activity latter powerful vivo klfmef atfklfmef klf mef alone promoted axonal sprouting dorsal column lesion site led improved functional recovery gene expression profiling revealed unexpectedly mefvp construct used little transcriptional activity vivo suggesting additional steps may required achieve full mef activity combinations except mef alone induced rag expression mirroring induced axotomy significant extents atfklfmef klf atf klfmef also induced apoptosisrelated genes may hinder regeneration tf combination klfmef partially mimics conditioning lesion effect inducing axonal sprouting dorsal column lesion driving significant rag expression also promotes functional improvement,Neurogenomics
"One of the main goals of human genome project was to identify all the protein-coding genes. There are ∼ 20,500 protein-coding genes annotated in human reference databases. However, in the last few years, proteogenomics studies have predicted thousands of novel protein-coding regions including low molecular weight proteins encoded by small open reading frames (ORFs) in untranslated regions of messenger RNAs and non-coding RNAs. Most of these predictions are based on bioinformatics analysis and ribosome footprints. The validity of some of these small ORF (sORF) encoded proteins (SEPs) has been established following functional characterization. With the growing number of predicted novel proteins, a strategy to identify reliable candidates that warrant further studies is needed. We developed an integrated proteogenomics workflow to identify reliable set of novel protein-coding regions in the human genome based on their recurrent observations across multiple samples. Publicly available ribosome profiling and global proteomics datasets were used to establish protein-coding evidence. We predicted protein translation from 4008 ORFs based on recurrent ribosome occupancy signals across samples. In addition, we identified 825 SEPs based on proteomics data. Some of the novel protein-coding regions identified were in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci associated with various traits and disease phenotypes. Peptides from SEPs are also presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) complex similar to canonical proteins.

"Single-nucleotide variants near <i>TMEM106B</i> associate with the risk of frontotemporal lobar dementia with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the causal variant at this locus remains unclear. Here, we asked whether a novel structural variant on <i>TMEM106B</i> is the causal variant. An exploratory analysis identified structural variants on neurodegeneration-related genes. Subsequent analyses focused on an <i>Alu</i> element insertion on the 3'UTR of <i>TMEM106B</i>. This study included data from longitudinal aging and neurogenerative disease cohorts at Stanford University, case-control cohorts in the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), and expression and proteomics data from Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL). Four hundred thirty-two individuals from 2 Stanford aging cohorts were whole-genome long-read and short-read sequenced. A total of 16,906 samples from ADSP were short-read sequenced. Genotypes, transcriptomics, and proteomics data were available in 1,979 participants from an aging and dementia cohort at WUSTL. Selection criteria were specific to each cohort. In primary analyses, the linkage disequilibrium between the <i>TMEM106B</i> locus variants in the FTLD-TDP GWAS and the 3'UTR insertion was estimated. We then estimated linkage by ancestry in the ADSP and evaluated the effect of the <i>TMEM106B</i> lead variant on mRNA and protein levels. The primary analysis included 432 participants (52.5% female, age range 45-92 years). We identified a 316 bp <i>Alu</i> insertion overlapping the <i>TMEM106B</i> 3'UTR tightly linked with top GWAS variants rs3173615(C) and rs1990622(A). In ADSP European ancestry participants, this insertion is in equivalent linkage with rs1990622(A) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.962, D' = 0.998) and rs3173615(C) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.960, D' = 0.996). In African ancestry participants, the insertion is in stronger linkage with rs1990622(A) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.992, D' = 0.998) than with rs3173615(C) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.811, D' = 0.994). In public data sets, rs1990622 was consistently associated with TMEM106B protein levels but not with mRNA expression. In the WUSTL data set, rs1990622 is associated with TMEM106B protein levels in plasma and CSF, but not with <i>TMEM106B</i> mRNA expression. We identified a novel <i>Alu</i> element insertion in the 3'UTR of <i>TMEM106B</i> in tight linkage with the lead FTLD-TDP risk variant.

We describe 13 patients from 8 different families, of which 10 had adolescent/adult-onset head and upper limb tremor followed by static cervical dystonia without PxD. We report three novel ADCY5 variants in these patients, located in the catalytic domains, close to previously reported variants. Caffeine was ineffective for the 3 patients who tried the treatment, and botulinum toxin therapy seemed to be the most effective treatment. We also describe 2 patients with spontaneous remission of pediatric-onset PxD before adulthood. We highlight an adolescent/adult-onset phenotype with head tremor and cervical dystonia, widening the genetic spectrum of cervical dystonia. Moreover, we broaden the pediatric ADCY5-PxD phenotype, highlighting previously unreported cases of spontaneous remission.",Neurogenomics,adcyrelated movement disorders typically paroxysmal dyskinesia pxds andor static hyperkinetic movement disorders nocturnal paroxysmal dyskinesia pxd facial perioral dyskinesia suggestive genetic diagnosis next generation sequencing enabled expansion adcy related phenotype aim study report atypical phenotypes describe patients different families adolescentadultonset head upper limb tremor followed static cervical dystonia without pxd report three novel adcy variants patients located catalytic domains close previously reported variants caffeine ineffective patients tried treatment botulinum toxin therapy seemed effective treatment also describe patients spontaneous remission pediatriconset pxd adulthood highlight adolescentadultonset phenotype head tremor cervical dystonia widening genetic spectrum cervical dystonia moreover broaden pediatric adcypxd phenotype highlighting previously unreported cases spontaneous remission,Neurogenomics
"Aggressive behavior is ubiquitous across many contexts, including defense of territories, mates, and offspring. For decades, researchers have detailed the effect of aggressive behavior on physiology, but our understanding of these mechanisms in females lags behind that of males, despite the fact that female aggression is widespread, particularly in the context of maternal defense of eggs or offspring (i.e., maternal aggression). Here, we measured effects of a social challenge on brain gene expression in free-living incubating females. We hypothesized that the social challenge would generate at least one of three transcriptomic effects: (1) sensitizing the brain to otherwise low levels of sex steroids, (2) changing other neuroendocrine signaling pathways associated with social behavior (e.g., dopamine), or (3) broad shifts related to metabolism or immune function. We tested these hypotheses in incubating female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), exposing 10 females to a 30-min simulated territorial intrusion, which elicited maternal aggression. After this challenge, we measured neural gene expression via RNA-seq and compared gene expression to 10 unchallenged controls. We saw no global treatment effect on gene expression. However, within the experimental group, more maternal aggression was correlated with upregulation of genes associated with immune activation and downregulation of genes associated with synaptic plasticity. Though more research is needed to understand the downstream effects of these transcriptional differences, our findings generate key questions about how the brain responds to social challenges across different contexts.",Neurogenomics,aggressive behavior ubiquitous across many contexts including defense territories mates offspring decades researchers detailed effect aggressive behavior physiology understanding mechanisms females lags behind males despite fact female aggression widespread particularly context maternal defense eggs offspring ie maternal aggression measured effects social challenge brain gene expression freeliving incubating females hypothesized social challenge would generate least one three transcriptomic effects sensitizing brain otherwise low levels sex steroids changing neuroendocrine signaling pathways associated social behavior eg dopamine broad shifts related metabolism immune function tested hypotheses incubating female tree swallows tachycineta bicolor exposing females min simulated territorial intrusion elicited maternal aggression challenge measured neural gene expression via rnaseq compared gene expression unchallenged controls saw global treatment effect gene expression however within experimental group maternal aggression correlated upregulation genes associated immune activation downregulation genes associated synaptic plasticity though research needed understand downstream effects transcriptional differences findings generate key questions brain responds social challenges across different contexts,Neurogenomics
"Genetic dystonia is a complex movement disorder with diverse clinical manifestations resulting from pathogenic mutations in associated genes. A recent paradigm shift emphasizes the functional convergence among dystonia genes, hinting at a shared pathomechanism. However, the neural dynamics supporting this convergence remain largely unexplored. Herein, we analyzed microelectrode recordings acquired during pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery from 31 dystonia patients with pathogenic mutations in the AOPEP, GNAL, KMT2B, PANK2, PLA2G6, SGCE, THAP1, TOR1A, and VPS16 genes. We identified 1,694 single units whose activity was characterized by a broad set of neural features. AOPEP, PANK2, and THAP1 displayed higher firing regularity, whereas GNAL, PLA2G6, KMT2B, and SGCE shared a large fraction of bursting neurons (> 26.6%), significantly exceeding the rate in other genes. TOR1A and VPS16 genes constituted an intermediate group, bridging these 2 groups, due to having the highest degree of spiking irregularity. Hierarchical clustering algorithms based on these dynamics confirmed the results obtained with first-order comparisons. Despite lacking common molecular pathways, dystonia genes share largely overlapping structures of neural patterns, in particular the degree of pallidal spiking regularity and bursting activity. We propose that the degree of desynchronization facilitated by pallidal neural bursts may explain the variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) surgery outcomes across genetic dystonia syndromes. Lastly, investigating the effects of genetic mutations on low-frequency pallidal activity could optimize personalized adaptive DBS treatments in patients with genetic dystonia.

"This study aims to improve genetic diagnosis in childhood onset epilepsy with neurodevelopmental problems by utilizing RNA sequencing of fibroblasts to identify pathogenic variants that may be missed by exome sequencing and copy number variation analysis. We enrolled 41 individuals with childhood onset epilepsy and neurodevelopmental problems who previously had inconclusive genetic testing. Fibroblast samples were cultured and analyzed using RNA sequencing to detect aberrant expression, aberrant splicing, and monoallelic expression using the Detection of RNA Outlier Pipeline (DROP) pipeline. Detected events were correlated with phenotypes, and long-read genome sequencing was performed on individuals with strong candidate events to identify the causal genomic variant. A systematic literature review on RNA sequencing in rare disorders was conducted to contextualize our findings. RNA sequencing identified five strong candidate events in four individuals, affecting the genes QRICH1, TSC1, SMARCA1, GNAI1, and PTEN. (Likely) pathogenic genomic variants affecting expression of QRICH1, TSC1, and SMARCA1 were detected, resulting in a diagnostic yield of 7% (3/41). Two variants were not covered in the initial exome sequencing data but were revealed through long-read sequencing. The identification of a pathogenic TSC1 variant led to a previously unrecognized diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex. This prompted guideline-based screening, which revealed tuberous sclerosis lesions in the brain and lung, directly impacting clinical care. Notably, two of the three pathogenic events would not have been detected using whole blood due to the lack of expression of the involved genes. The lower yield of this study compared to studies in other rare disorders reflects the genetic heterogeneity of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders, and the inaccessibility of affected tissue. This research underscores RNA sequencing of cultured fibroblasts as a valuable tool in genetic diagnostics for childhood onset epilepsy, particularly when conventional methods fail. Expanding the control dataset with age-matched samples and incorporating RNA sequencing with nonsense-mediated decay inhibition could further enhance diagnostic yield.",Neurogenomics,study aims improve genetic diagnosis childhood onset epilepsy neurodevelopmental problems utilizing rna sequencing fibroblasts identify pathogenic variants may missed exome sequencing copy number variation analysis enrolled individuals childhood onset epilepsy neurodevelopmental problems previously inconclusive genetic testing fibroblast samples cultured analyzed using rna sequencing detect aberrant expression aberrant splicing monoallelic expression using detection rna outlier pipeline drop pipeline detected events correlated phenotypes longread genome sequencing performed individuals strong candidate events identify causal genomic variant systematic literature review rna sequencing rare disorders conducted contextualize findings rna sequencing identified five strong candidate events four individuals affecting genes qrich tsc smarca gnai pten likely pathogenic genomic variants affecting expression qrich tsc smarca detected resulting diagnostic yield two variants covered initial exome sequencing data revealed longread sequencing identification pathogenic tsc variant led previously unrecognized diagnosis tuberous sclerosis complex prompted guidelinebased screening revealed tuberous sclerosis lesions brain lung directly impacting clinical care notably two three pathogenic events would detected using whole blood due lack expression involved genes lower yield study compared studies rare disorders reflects genetic heterogeneity epilepsy neurodevelopmental disorders inaccessibility affected tissue research underscores rna sequencing cultured fibroblasts valuable tool genetic diagnostics childhood onset epilepsy particularly conventional methods fail expanding control dataset agematched samples incorporating rna sequencing nonsensemediated decay inhibition could enhance diagnostic yield,Neurogenomics
"We conducted a genome-wide association study on income among individuals of European descent (N = 668,288) to investigate the relationship between socio-economic status and health disparities. We identified 162 genomic loci associated with a common genetic factor underlying various income measures, all with small effect sizes (the Income Factor). Our polygenic index captures 1-5% of income variance, with only one fourth due to direct genetic effects. A phenome-wide association study using this index showed reduced risks for diseases including hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, depression, asthma and back pain. The Income Factor had a substantial genetic correlation (0.92, s.e. = 0.006) with educational attainment. Accounting for the genetic overlap of educational attainment with income revealed that the remaining genetic signal was linked to better mental health but reduced physical health and increased risky behaviours such as drinking and smoking.

"The <i>FOXP2</i>/<i>Foxp2</i> gene, linked to fine motor control in vertebrates, is a potential candidate gene thought to play a prominent role in human language production. It is expressed specifically in a subset of corticothalamic (CT) pyramidal cells (PCs) in layer 6 (L6) of the neocortex. These L6 FOXP2+ PCs project exclusively to the thalamus, with L6a PCs targeting first-order or both first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei, whereas L6b PCs connect only to higher-order nuclei. Synaptic connections established by both L6a and L6b FOXP2+ PCs have low release probabilities and respond strongly to acetylcholine (ACh), triggering action potential (AP) trains. Notably, L6b FOXP2- PCs are more sensitive to ACh than L6a, and L6b FOXP2+ PCs also react robustly to dopamine. Thus, FOXP2 labels L6a and L6b CT PCs, which are precisely regulated by neuromodulators, highlighting their roles as potent modulators of thalamic activity.",Neurogenomics,ifoxpiifoxpi gene linked fine motor control vertebrates potential candidate gene thought play prominent role human language production expressed specifically subset corticothalamic ct pyramidal cells pcs layer l neocortex l foxp pcs project exclusively thalamus la pcs targeting firstorder first higherorder thalamic nuclei whereas lb pcs connect higherorder nuclei synaptic connections established la lb foxp pcs low release probabilities respond strongly acetylcholine ach triggering action potential ap trains notably lb foxp pcs sensitive ach la lb foxp pcs also react robustly dopamine thus foxp labels la lb ct pcs precisely regulated neuromodulators highlighting roles potent modulators thalamic activity,Neurogenomics
"Hippocampal volume increases throughout early development and is an important indicator of cognitive abilities and mental health. However, hippocampal development is highly vulnerable to exposures during development, as seen by smaller hippocampal volume and differential epigenetic programming in genes implicated in mental health. However, few studies have investigated hippocampal volume in relation to the peripheral epigenome across development, and even less is known about potential genetic moderators. Therefore, in this study, we explored relationships between hippocampal volume and peripheral DNA methylation of mental health-related genes, specifically <i>NR3C1</i>, <i>FKBP5</i>, and <i>SLC6A4</i>, throughout early development and whether these associations were moderated by age or genotype. Bilateral hippocampal volume was computed from T2-weighted images through FreeSurfer, and DNA methylation was measured from saliva using the Illumina MethylationEPIC microarray in a pediatric population (<i>N</i> = 248, females = 112, mean<sub>age</sub> = 5.13 years, SD<sub>age</sub> = 3.60 years). Multiple linear regression and bootstrapping analyses revealed that DNA methylation of <i>NR3C1</i>, <i>FKBP5</i>, and <i>SLC6A4</i> was associated with hippocampal volume and that these relationships were moderated by age and gene-specific variants. These findings support the validity of peripheral DNA methylation profiles for indirectly assessing hippocampal volume and development and underscore the importance of genotype and age considerations in research. Therefore, peripheral epigenetic profiles may be a promising avenue for investigating the impacts of early-life stress on brain structure and subsequent mental health outcomes.",Neurogenomics,hippocampal volume increases throughout early development important indicator cognitive abilities mental health however hippocampal development highly vulnerable exposures development seen smaller hippocampal volume differential epigenetic programming genes implicated mental health however studies investigated hippocampal volume relation peripheral epigenome across development even less known potential genetic moderators therefore study explored relationships hippocampal volume peripheral dna methylation mental healthrelated genes specifically inrci ifkbpi islcai throughout early development whether associations moderated age genotype bilateral hippocampal volume computed tweighted images freesurfer dna methylation measured saliva using illumina methylationepic microarray pediatric population ini females meansubagesub years sdsubagesub years multiple linear regression bootstrapping analyses revealed dna methylation inrci ifkbpi islcai associated hippocampal volume relationships moderated age genespecific variants findings support validity peripheral dna methylation profiles indirectly assessing hippocampal volume development underscore importance genotype age considerations research therefore peripheral epigenetic profiles may promising avenue investigating impacts earlylife stress brain structure subsequent mental health outcomes,Neurogenomics
"The development and approval of novel drugs are typically time-intensive and expensive. Leveraging a computational drug repurposing framework that integrates disease-relevant genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) and large longitudinal electronic medical record (EMR) databases can expedite the repositioning of existing medications. However, validating computational predictions of the drug repurposing framework remains a challenge. To benchmark the drug repurposing framework, we first performed a 5-method-rank-based computational drug prioritization pipeline by integrating multi-tissue GReX associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization, with drug transcriptional signature libraries from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures. We prioritized FDA-approved medications from the 10 top-ranked compounds, and assessed their association with COVID-19 incidence within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cohort (~9 million individuals). In parallel, we evaluated <i>in vitro</i> SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition in human lung epithelial cells for the selected candidates. Our <i>in silico</i> pipeline identified seven FDA-approved drugs among the top ten candidates. Six (imiquimod, nelfinavir and saquinavir, everolimus, azathioprine, and retinol) had sufficient prescribing rates or feasibility for further testing. In the VHA cohort, azathioprine (odds ratio [OR]=0.69, 95% CI 0.62-0.77) and retinol (OR=0.81, 95% CI 0.72-0.92) were significantly associated with reduced COVID-19 incidence. Conversely, nelfinavir and saquinavir demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibition <i>in vitro</i> (~95% and ~65% viral load reduction, respectively). No single compound showed robust protection in both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> settings. These findings underscore the power of GReX-based drug repurposing in rapidly identifying existing therapies with potential clinical relevance; four out of six compounds showed a protective effect in one of the two validation approaches. Crucially, our results highlight how a complementary evaluation-combining epidemiological data and <i>in vitro</i> assays-helps refine the most promising candidates for subsequent mechanistic studies and clinical trials.

"Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is an axon guidance molecule, which is also abundant in the adult central nervous system (CNS), particularly in perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that restrict plasticity. The cellular sources of Sema3A in PNNs are unknown. Most Sema3A-bearing neurons do not express <i>Sema3A</i> mRNA, suggesting that Sema3A may be released from other neurons. Another potential source of Sema3A is the choroid plexus. To identify sources of PNN-associated Sema3A, we focused on the cerebellar nuclei, which contain Sema3A<sup>+</sup> PNNs. Cerebellar nuclei neurons receive prominent input from Purkinje cells (PCs), which express high levels of <i>Sema3A</i> mRNA. By using a non-invasive viral vector approach, we overexpressed Cre in PCs, the choroid plexus, or throughout the CNS of <i>Sema3A<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice. Knocking out <i>Sema3A</i> in PCs or the choroid plexus was not sufficient to decrease the amount of PNN-associated Sema3A. Alternatively, knocking out <i>Sema3A</i> throughout the CNS induced a decrease in PNN-associated Sema3A. However, motor deficits, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration were observed, which were due to Cre toxicity. Our study represents the first attempt to unravel cellular sources of PNN-associated Sema3A and shows that non-invasive viral-mediated Cre expression throughout the CNS could lead to toxicity, complicating the interpretation of Cre-mediated <i>Sema3A</i> knock-out.",Neurogenomics,semaphorin semaa axon guidance molecule also abundant adult central nervous system cns particularly perineuronal nets pnns pnns extracellular matrix structures restrict plasticity cellular sources semaa pnns unknown semaabearing neurons express isemaai mrna suggesting semaa may released neurons another potential source semaa choroid plexus identify sources pnnassociated semaa focused cerebellar nuclei contain semaasupsup pnns cerebellar nuclei neurons receive prominent input purkinje cells pcs express high levels isemaai mrna using noninvasive viral vector approach overexpressed cre pcs choroid plexus throughout cns isemaasupflflsupi mice knocking isemaai pcs choroid plexus sufficient decrease amount pnnassociated semaa alternatively knocking isemaai throughout cns induced decrease pnnassociated semaa however motor deficits microgliosis neurodegeneration observed due cre toxicity study represents first attempt unravel cellular sources pnnassociated semaa shows noninvasive viralmediated cre expression throughout cns could lead toxicity complicating interpretation cremediated isemaai knockout,Neurogenomics
"Sex chromosomes are a fundamental aspect of sex-biased biology, but the extent to which homologous X-Y gene pairs ('the gametologs') contribute to sex-biased phenotypes remains hotly debated. Although these genes tend to exhibit large sex differences in expression throughout the body (XX females can express both X members, and XY males can express one X and one Y member), there is conflicting evidence regarding the degree of functional divergence between the X and Y members. Here we develop and apply co-expression fingerprint analysis to characterize functional divergence between the X and Y members of 17 gametolog gene pairs across >40 human tissues. Gametolog pairs exhibit functional divergence between the sexes that is driven by divergence between the X versus Y members (assayed in males), and this within-pair divergence is greatest among pairs with evolutionarily distant X and Y members. These patterns reflect that X versus Y gametologs show coordinated patterns of asymmetric coupling with large sets of autosomal genes, which are enriched for functional pathways and gene sets implicated in sex-biased biology and disease. Our findings suggest that the X versus Y gametologs have diverged in function and prioritize specific gametolog pairs for future targeted experimental studies.",Neurogenomics,sex chromosomes fundamental aspect sexbiased biology extent homologous xy gene pairs gametologs contribute sexbiased phenotypes remains hotly debated although genes tend exhibit large sex differences expression throughout body xx females express x members xy males express one x one member conflicting evidence regarding degree functional divergence x members develop apply coexpression fingerprint analysis characterize functional divergence x members gametolog gene pairs across human tissues gametolog pairs exhibit functional divergence sexes driven divergence x versus members assayed males withinpair divergence greatest among pairs evolutionarily distant x members patterns reflect x versus gametologs show coordinated patterns asymmetric coupling large sets autosomal genes enriched functional pathways gene sets implicated sexbiased biology disease findings suggest x versus gametologs diverged function prioritize specific gametolog pairs future targeted experimental studies,Neurogenomics

This multicohort study selected data from eight longitudinal cohort studies of normal aging and AD. Variable recruitment criteria and follow-up intervals, including both population-based and clinical-based samples. Inclusion in our analyses required <i>APOE</i> genotype, that participants be age 50+, and are identified as either non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White. In total, 18,080 participants were included in the present study with a total of 78,549 datapoints. Harmonized, longitudinal memory, executive function, and language scores were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC). SuperAgers, controls, and AD dementia cases were identified by cognitive scores using a residual approach and clinical diagnoses across multiple timepoints when available. SuperAgers were compared to AD dementia cases and cognitively normal controls using age-defined bins (middle-aged, old, oldest-old). Across racialized groups, SuperAgers had significantly higher proportions of <i>APOE</i>-ε2 alleles and lower proportions of <i>APOE</i>-ε4 alleles compared to cases.

"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been linked to changes in DNA methylation levels, which can, in turn, alter transcriptional activity. However, most studies for epigenome-wide associations between T2D and DNA methylation comes from cross-sectional design. Few large-scale investigations have explored these associations longitudinally over multiple time-points. In this longitudinal study, we examined data from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4 and FF4 studies, conducted approximately seven years apart. Leucocyte DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina EPIC and 450K arrays. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to identify significant associations between methylation sites and diabetes status, as well as with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), homoeostasis model assessment of beta cell function (HOMA-B), and homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Interaction effects between diabetes status and follow-up time were also examined. Additionally, we explored CpG sites associated with persistent prediabetes or T2D, as well as the progression from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to prediabetes or T2D. Finally, we assessed the associations between the identified CpG sites and their corresponding gene expression levels. A total of 3,501 observations from 2,556 participants, with methylation measured at least once across two visits, were included in the analyses. We identified 64 sites associated with T2D including 15 novel sites as well as known associations like those with the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 1 (ABCG1) genes. Of these, eight CpG sites exhibited different rates of annual methylation change between the NGT and T2D groups, and seven CpG sites were linked to the progression from NGT to prediabetes or T2D, including those annotated to mannosidase alpha class 2a member 2 (MAN2A2) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A (CPT1A). Longitudinal analysis revealed significant associations between methylation and FPG at 128 sites, HbA1c at 41 sites, and HOMA-IR at 57 sites. Additionally, we identified 104 CpG-transcript pairs in whole blood, comprising 40 unique CpG sites and 96 unique gene transcripts. Our study identified novel differentially methylated loci linked to T2D as well as to changes in diabetes status through a longitudinal approach. We report CpG sites with different rates of annual methylation change and demonstrate that DNA methylation associated with T2D is linked to following transcriptional differences.

"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are clinically approved drugs for the treatment of hematological malignancies synergizing with chemotherapy. However, despite the long history of HDACi, the mechanistic underpinnings of this synergism have remained unclear. Using transmission electron microscopy, we identified autophagy and ER-stress in HDACi-treated cells. We quantified ER-phagy and ER-stress with reporter systems by using 3D-deconvolution microscopy and flow cytometry. We complemented these data with qPCR and Western blot results. Apoptosis rates were assessed using a caspase assay and flow cytometry, and large public datasets were utilized. HDAC blockade results in specific upregulation of the selective autophagy receptor FAM134B (RETREG1) and the induction of ER-phagy. Combined with the chemotherapeutic drug Gemcitabine, this results in subsequent elevated ER-stress levels and apoptosis. Inhibiting the distinct ER-stress branches fully rescues this process.

"Enterobacter hormaechei is of increasing concern as both an opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen, exacerbated by its evolving multidrug resistance. However, its taxonomy remains contentious, and little is known about its pathogenesis and the broader context of its resistome. In this study, a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis was undertaken to address these issues. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that E. hormaechei represents a complex, comprising three predicted species, E. hormaechei, E. hoffmannii and E. xiangfangensis, with the latter putatively comprising three distinct subspecies, namely oharae, steigerwaltii and xiangfangensis. The species and subspecies all display open and distinct pan-genomes, with diversification driven by an array of mobile genetic elements including numerous plasmid replicons and prophages, integrative conjugative elements (ICE) and transposable elements. These elements have given rise to a broad, relatively conserved set of pathogenicity determinants, but also a variable set of secretion systems. The E. hormaechei complex displays a highly mutable resistome, with most taxa being multidrug resistant. This study addressed key issues pertaining to the taxonomy of the E. hormaechei complex, which may contribute towards more accurate identification of strains belonging to this species complex in the clinical setting. The pathogenicity determinants identified in this study could serve as a basis for a deeper understanding of E. hormaechei complex pathogenesis and virulence. The extensive nature of multidrug resistance among E. hormaechei complex strains highlights the need for responsible antibiotic stewardship to ensure effective treatment of these emerging pathogens.",Systems Biology,enterobacter hormaechei increasing concern opportunistic nosocomial pathogen exacerbated evolving multidrug resistance however taxonomy remains contentious little known pathogenesis broader context resistome study comprehensive comparative genomic analysis undertaken address issues phylogenomic analysis revealed e hormaechei represents complex comprising three predicted species e hormaechei e hoffmannii e xiangfangensis latter putatively comprising three distinct subspecies namely oharae steigerwaltii xiangfangensis species subspecies display open distinct pangenomes diversification driven array mobile genetic elements including numerous plasmid replicons prophages integrative conjugative elements ice transposable elements elements given rise broad relatively conserved set pathogenicity determinants also variable set secretion systems e hormaechei complex displays highly mutable resistome taxa multidrug resistant study addressed key issues pertaining taxonomy e hormaechei complex may contribute towards accurate identification strains belonging species complex clinical setting pathogenicity determinants identified study could serve basis deeper understanding e hormaechei complex pathogenesis virulence extensive nature multidrug resistance among e hormaechei complex strains highlights need responsible antibiotic stewardship ensure effective treatment emerging pathogens,Systems Biology
"Daptomycin (DAP) is a last-resort antibiotic to treat infections by multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. DAP resistance and clinical treatment failure has been associated with adaptive chromosomal mutations, but so far not with transmissible resistance traits. Here we report for the first time an acquired DAP-R determinant (named drc) that we detected in a livestock-associated Mammaliicoccus sciuri isolate. drc consists of a two-gene operon (drcAB) that is controlled by an adjacent two-component system (drcRS). The DrcAB proteins, which mediate DAP inactivation, are similar to BceAB-like antimicrobial peptide transporters of Gram-positives, but are distinct from currently known systems. The mobile drc locus is functional in various bacterial backgrounds, including MRSA. It circulates primarily among Gram-positives in the environment, but also in commensal staphylococci and enterococci, suggesting a risk of transmission into pathogens and emphasizing the importance of low and apathogenic microorganisms as resistance gene reservoirs.",Systems Biology,daptomycin dap lastresort antibiotic treat infections multiresistant grampositive pathogens including methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa vancomycinresistant enterococci dap resistance clinical treatment failure associated adaptive chromosomal mutations far transmissible resistance traits report first time acquired dapr determinant named drc detected livestockassociated mammaliicoccus sciuri isolate drc consists twogene operon drcab controlled adjacent twocomponent system drcrs drcab proteins mediate dap inactivation similar bceablike antimicrobial peptide transporters grampositives distinct currently known systems mobile drc locus functional various bacterial backgrounds including mrsa circulates primarily among grampositives environment also commensal staphylococci enterococci suggesting risk transmission pathogens emphasizing importance low apathogenic microorganisms resistance gene reservoirs,Systems Biology
"We report the successful moss-produced recombinant spider silk key protein component containing both the N- and the C-terminal domain. Spider dragline silk stands out as a remarkable biomaterial, representing one of nature's toughest fibres. Its strength rivals that of many synthetic fibres used commercially, rendering it applicable across various industrial and medical domains. However, its widespread utilisation requires cost-effective mass production. Biotechnology presents a promising avenue for achieving this goal, particularly through the production of recombinant dragline silk proteins in transgenic plant systems. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of producing one key protein component of dragline silk, MaSp1, from the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, the protein LhMaSp1, in the moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens). Here, we present the successful recombinant production of spider silk protein containing both the N- and C-terminal domains of LhMaSp1 in moss cells. The production of recombinant LhMaSp1 protein in Physcomitrella was performed in shake flasks and in five-litre photobioreactors and the correct synthesis of LhMaSp1 was proven via mass spectrometry.

"Chaperone proteins constitute a molecular machinery that controls proteostasis. HSPA2 is a heat shock-non-inducible member of the human HSPA/HSP70 family, which includes several highly homologous chaperone proteins. HSPA2 exhibits a cell type-specific expression pattern in the testis, brain, and multilayered epithelia. It is a crucial male fertility-related factor, but its role in somatic cells is poorly understood. Previously, we found that HSPA2 deficiency can impair epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. In this study, we confirmed the crucial role of HSPA2 in keratinocyte differentiation by investigating immortalized keratinocytes cultured in a reconstructed human epidermis model. Moreover, we uncovered the influence of HSPA2 on immunomodulation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the total loss of HSPA2 affected the expression of genes related to keratinocyte differentiation and interleukin- and interferon-mediated signaling. The functional analysis confirmed bidirectional changes associated with the loss of HSPA2. The HSPA2 knockout in HaCaT and Ker-CT keratinocytes, but not HSPA2 overproduction, impaired granular layer development as evidenced by reduced levels of late keratinocyte differentiation markers, filaggrin and involucrin, along with structural abnormalities in the upper epidermal layer. Differentiation defects were accompanied by increased mRNA expression and extracellular secretion of keratinocyte-derived pro-inflammatory IL-6 cytokine and CCL2, CCL8, CXCL1, CXCL6, and CXCL10 chemokines. The loss of HSPA2 also led to increased expression of extracellular HSPA1 and interferon-stimulated genes and secretion of immune cell modulator SLAMF7. Knocking down HSPA1 expression in keratinocytes decreased the secretion of IL-6 and CCL5 release, suggesting extracellular HSPA1's role in the HSPA2-regulated molecular network. To summarize, we uncovered the complex homeostatic role of HSPA2 in epidermal keratinocytes. Our results suggest that dysfunction in HSPA2 activity could be an important pathogenicity factor and potential therapeutic target for inflammatory cutaneous diseases.",Systems Biology,chaperone proteins constitute molecular machinery controls proteostasis hspa heat shocknoninducible member human hspahsp family includes several highly homologous chaperone proteins hspa exhibits cell typespecific expression pattern testis brain multilayered epithelia crucial male fertilityrelated factor role somatic cells poorly understood previously found hspa deficiency impair epidermal keratinocyte differentiation study confirmed crucial role hspa keratinocyte differentiation investigating immortalized keratinocytes cultured reconstructed human epidermis model moreover uncovered influence hspa immunomodulation transcriptomic analysis revealed total loss hspa affected expression genes related keratinocyte differentiation interleukin interferonmediated signaling functional analysis confirmed bidirectional changes associated loss hspa hspa knockout hacat kerct keratinocytes hspa overproduction impaired granular layer development evidenced reduced levels late keratinocyte differentiation markers filaggrin involucrin along structural abnormalities upper epidermal layer differentiation defects accompanied increased mrna expression extracellular secretion keratinocytederived proinflammatory il cytokine ccl ccl cxcl cxcl cxcl chemokines loss hspa also led increased expression extracellular hspa interferonstimulated genes secretion immune cell modulator slamf knocking hspa expression keratinocytes decreased secretion il ccl release suggesting extracellular hspas role hsparegulated molecular network summarize uncovered complex homeostatic role hspa epidermal keratinocytes results suggest dysfunction hspa activity could important pathogenicity factor potential therapeutic target inflammatory cutaneous diseases,Systems Biology
"Mapping enhancers and target genes in disease-related cell types provides critical insights into the functional mechanisms of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) variants. Single-cell multimodal data, which measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same cells, enable the cell-type-specific inference of enhancer-gene pairs. However, this task is challenged by high data sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of pairs. We introduce scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power, and computational efficiency (1% of existing methods). When applied to Alzheimer's disease (AD) data, scMultiMap gives the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and reveals insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants.",Systems Biology,mapping enhancers target genes diseaserelated cell types provides critical insights functional mechanisms genomewide association studies gwas variants singlecell multimodal data measure gene expression chromatin accessibility cells enable celltypespecific inference enhancergene pairs however task challenged high data sparsity sequencing depth variation computational burden analyzing large number pairs introduce scmultimap statistical method infers enhancergene association sparse multimodal counts using joint latentvariable model adjusts technical confounding permits fast momentbased estimation provides analytically derived pvalues blood brain data scmultimap shows appropriate type error control high statistical power computational efficiency existing methods applied alzheimers disease ad data scmultimap gives highest heritability enrichment microglia reveals insights regulatory mechanisms ad gwas variants,Systems Biology
"Modeling complex, nonlinear ecosystem processes across different timescales presents a significant challenge. We identify two key issues: selecting a representative timestep that captures interconnected processes across various timescales, and simulating these processes in an appropriate sequence. By synthesizing existing ecosystem frameworks, we find shared compromises between biological realism and computational performance. For the representative timestep, these include 'selective elimination of timescales', 'biting the bullet', 'each in their own time', and 'capture the unseen'. For processing order, we identify hierarchical, logical, iterative, and random approaches. Similar challenges exist in other disciplines, and we show how transferring methods from multiple fields, along with smarter computing, can improve timescale integration. Overcoming these challenges requires innovative transdisciplinary solutions, and we outline directions for future research.",Systems Biology,modeling complex nonlinear ecosystem processes across different timescales presents significant challenge identify two key issues selecting representative timestep captures interconnected processes across various timescales simulating processes appropriate sequence synthesizing existing ecosystem frameworks find shared compromises biological realism computational performance representative timestep include selective elimination timescales biting bullet time capture unseen processing order identify hierarchical logical iterative random approaches similar challenges exist disciplines show transferring methods multiple fields along smarter computing improve timescale integration overcoming challenges requires innovative transdisciplinary solutions outline directions future research,Systems Biology
"Metastasis is a lethal disease of cancer, spreading from primary tumors to the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), which disseminate to distant organs at low efficiency for secondary tumor regeneration, thereby contributing to unfavorable patient outcomes. The detection of dynamic CTC alterations can be indicative of cancer progression (residual cancer, aggressiveness, therapy resistance) or regression (therapy response), serving as biomarkers for diagnoses and prognoses. CTC heterogeneity is impacted by both intrinsic oncogenic changes and extrinsic microenvironmental factors (e.g. the immune system and circadian rhythm), altering the genomic/genetic, epigenomic/epigenetic, proteomic, post-translational, and metabolomic landscapes. In addition to homeostatic dynamics, regenerative stemness, and metabolic plasticity, a newly discovered feature of CTCs that influences metastatic outcomes is its intercellular clustering. While the dogma suggests that CTCs play solo as single cells in the circulation, CTCs can orchestrate with other CTCs or white blood cells to form homotypic or heterotypic multi-cellular clusters, with 20-100 times enhanced metastatic potential than single CTCs. CTC clusters promote cell survival and stemness through DNA hypomethylation and signaling pathways activated by clustering-driving proteins (CD44, CD81, ICAM1, Podocalyxin, etc). Heterotypic CTC clusters may protect CTCs from immune cell attacks if not being cleared by cytotoxic immune cells. This chapter mainly focused on CTC biology related to multi-omic features and metastatic outcomes. We speculate that CTCs could guide therapeutic targeting and be targeted specifically by anti-CTC therapeutics to reduce or eliminate cancer and cancer metastasis.",Systems Biology,metastasis lethal disease cancer spreading primary tumors bloodstream circulating tumor cells ctcs disseminate distant organs low efficiency secondary tumor regeneration thereby contributing unfavorable patient outcomes detection dynamic ctc alterations indicative cancer progression residual cancer aggressiveness therapy resistance regression therapy response serving biomarkers diagnoses prognoses ctc heterogeneity impacted intrinsic oncogenic changes extrinsic microenvironmental factors eg immune system circadian rhythm altering genomicgenetic epigenomicepigenetic proteomic posttranslational metabolomic landscapes addition homeostatic dynamics regenerative stemness metabolic plasticity newly discovered feature ctcs influences metastatic outcomes intercellular clustering dogma suggests ctcs play solo single cells circulation ctcs orchestrate ctcs white blood cells form homotypic heterotypic multicellular clusters times enhanced metastatic potential single ctcs ctc clusters promote cell survival stemness dna hypomethylation signaling pathways activated clusteringdriving proteins cd cd icam podocalyxin etc heterotypic ctc clusters may protect ctcs immune cell attacks cleared cytotoxic immune cells chapter mainly focused ctc biology related multiomic features metastatic outcomes speculate ctcs could guide therapeutic targeting targeted specifically antictc therapeutics reduce eliminate cancer cancer metastasis,Systems Biology
"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are widely utilized host cell lines in cell culture bioprocessing. Although they originated from a common ancestor, accumulated genetic mutations have led to significant heterogeneity in their behavior under specific conditions. This study investigates the cell line-specific impact of polyamine (PUT; putrescine) withdrawal on the growth, metabolism, and antibody production among three CHO clones derived from different parental cell lines: CHO-K1, CHO-S, and CHO-DG44. CHO-K1 cells strongly depended on external polyamines, showing a 77% reduction in viable cell density and an 88% decrease in growth rate under PUT depletion, although their culture longevity was extended. In contrast, CHO-S and CHO-DG44 cells demonstrated greater resilience, with CHO-DG44 experiencing only a 25% reduction in cell density. PUT deprivation also impacted antibody production across all cell lines, with CHO-K1 displaying the lowest yield, antibody purity and altered charge heterogeneity. Notably, PUT depletion led to increased galactosylation of antibodies, suggesting that modulating PUT levels in the media could be used as a strategy to tailor the quality of therapeutic antibodies. These findings, together, provide valuable insights in the design of cell line-specific media, thereby optimizing both bioprocess efficiency and product quality in biopharmaceutical production.",Systems Biology,chinese hamster ovary cho cell lines widely utilized host cell lines cell culture bioprocessing although originated common ancestor accumulated genetic mutations led significant heterogeneity behavior specific conditions study investigates cell linespecific impact polyamine put putrescine withdrawal growth metabolism antibody production among three cho clones derived different parental cell lines chok chos chodg chok cells strongly depended external polyamines showing reduction viable cell density decrease growth rate put depletion although culture longevity extended contrast chos chodg cells demonstrated greater resilience chodg experiencing reduction cell density put deprivation also impacted antibody production across cell lines chok displaying lowest yield antibody purity altered charge heterogeneity notably put depletion led increased galactosylation antibodies suggesting modulating put levels media could used strategy tailor quality therapeutic antibodies findings together provide valuable insights design cell linespecific media thereby optimizing bioprocess efficiency product quality biopharmaceutical production,Systems Biology
"One worldwide environmental concern is the presence of potentially hazardous elements (PTEs) in air, soil, and water resources. Arsenic is one of the PTEs that is thought to be the most poisonous and carcinogenic. Plants exposed to arsenic may experience several morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes-even at extremely low concentrations. Arsenic toxicity to plants varies with its speciation in plants (e.g., arsenite, As(III); arsenate, As(V)), with the kind of plant species, and with other soil parameters affecting arsenic accumulation in plants, according to new study on arsenic in the soil-plant system. Arsenic stress modifies metabolic cascades in plants at different developmental stages by affecting the pattern of gene expressions mediated by small non-coding RNAs (micro-RNAs), which are essential for plant adaptation to oxidative stress and play a key role in the moderation of numerous cellular processes. In this review, we investigated the impact of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) on the toxicity of arsenic in plant and soil environments. Plant grown with arsenic exhibited enhanced arsenic uptake, increased oxidative stress and growth inhibition. Arsenic toxicity modulates carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism along with DNA structure. Role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ca channels and Ca sensors to signaling pathways also described briefly. A worldwide issue for humanity is the poisoning of soil ecosystems by arsenic.

"Obesity cardiomyopathy (OCM) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by altered mitochondrial dynamics. Extracellular mitochondria (exMito) are released following tissue injury under various conditions. While the excessive mitochondrial fission-mediated release of exMito as a mechanism for mitochondrial quality control in several inflammatory disorders, its role in OCM remains unclear. The present work aimed to determine if excessive mitochondrial fission and associated exMito mediate the chronic inflammatory response and cardiac remodeling in OCM. H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were treated with 200 μM palmitate (PA) to induce lipotoxicity. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce OCM. P110, a peptide inhibitor of Drp1/Fis1 interaction, was used to evaluate the impact of excessive mitochondrial fission on cardiac mitochondrial function, quality, and quantity of exMito, systemic inflammatory response, and cardiac contractile function in both models of OCM. PA induced excessive mitochondrial fission, increased oxidative stress, decreased ATP level, and damaged exMito release in vitro. Exposure of naïve cardiomyoblasts to exMito isolated from PA treated cells resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and a pro-inflammatory response. In vivo, HFD induced cardiac mitochondrial and contractile dysfunction, exMito release, and a pro-inflammatory response. Inhibition of Drp1/Fis1 interaction with P110 attenuated the observed effects both in vitro and in vivo. P110 limited lipid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased exMito release, subsequently improving the inflammatory state and contractile function in our OCM model.

"Environmental stressors in the modern world can fundamentally affect human physiology and health. Exposure to stressors like air pollution, heat, and traffic noise has been linked to a pronounced increase in non-communicable diseases. Specifically, aircraft noise has been identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, heart failure, stroke, and diabetes. Noise stress leads to neuronal activation with subsequent stress hormone release that ultimately activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases inflammation and oxidative stress thus substantially affecting the cardiovascular system. However, despite the epidemiological evidence of a link between noise stress and metabolic dysfunction, the consequences of exposure at the molecular, metabolic level of the cardiovascular system are largely unknown. Here, we use a murine model system of short-term aircraft noise exposure to show that noise stress profoundly alters heart metabolism. Within 4 days of noise exposure, the heart proteome and metabolome bear the hallmarks of reduced potential for generating ATP from fatty-acid beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. This is accompanied by the increased expression of glycolytic metabolites, including the end-product, lactate, suggesting a compensatory shift of energy production towards anaerobic glycolysis. Intriguingly, the metabolic shift is reminiscent of what is observed in failing and ischaemic hearts. Mechanistically, we further show that the metabolic rewiring is likely driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS), as we can rescue the phenotype by knocking out NOX-2/gp91phox, a ROS inducer, in mice. Our results suggest that within a short exposure time, the cardiovascular system undergoes a fundamental metabolic shift that bears the hallmarks of cardiovascular disease. These findings underscore the urgent need to comprehend the molecular consequences of environmental stressors, paving the way for targeted interventions to mitigate health risks associated with chronic noise exposure in modern, environments heavily disturbed by noise pollution.",Systems Biology,environmental stressors modern world fundamentally affect human physiology health exposure stressors like air pollution heat traffic noise linked pronounced increase noncommunicable diseases specifically aircraft noise identified risk factor cardiovascular metabolic diseases arteriosclerosis heart failure stroke diabetes noise stress leads neuronal activation subsequent stress hormone release ultimately activates reninangiotensinaldosterone system increases inflammation oxidative stress thus substantially affecting cardiovascular system however despite epidemiological evidence link noise stress metabolic dysfunction consequences exposure molecular metabolic level cardiovascular system largely unknown use murine model system shortterm aircraft noise exposure show noise stress profoundly alters heart metabolism within days noise exposure heart proteome metabolome bear hallmarks reduced potential generating atp fattyacid betaoxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle electron transport chain accompanied increased expression glycolytic metabolites including endproduct lactate suggesting compensatory shift energy production towards anaerobic glycolysis intriguingly metabolic shift reminiscent observed failing ischaemic hearts mechanistically show metabolic rewiring likely driven reactive oxygen species ros rescue phenotype knocking noxgpphox ros inducer mice results suggest within short exposure time cardiovascular system undergoes fundamental metabolic shift bears hallmarks cardiovascular disease findings underscore urgent need comprehend molecular consequences environmental stressors paving way targeted interventions mitigate health risks associated chronic noise exposure modern environments heavily disturbed noise pollution,Systems Biology
"Cardiac output (CO) is a quintessential property of the cardiovascular system, one whose estimation is vital to patient care in critical illness. The most common techniques for assessing CO, thermodilution (TD) and the estimated Fick (eFick) approximation, force tradeoffs that motivate a need for new methods. The purpose of this study was to novel CO estimators to fill key gaps in critical care medicine. Machine learning was used to estimate CO from physiology measurements made during routine clinical care in the intensive care unit (ICU) or cardiac catheterization lab. Models were trained and validated using a curated set of 13,172 ground-truth measurements of TD-CO from 4,825 patients. Model performance was evaluated using regression metrics, trajectory analysis, classification accuracy, and ΔCO tracking. Three established eFick models all performed poorly in the ICU because their static estimates of oxygen consumption could not track the dynamics of critical illness. In the postcardiac surgery intensive care unit, the best eFick model erred in its CO predictions by 30% (mean absolute percentage error [MAPE]) with a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) of -1.5. The best model derived here, labeled CORE (Catheter Optimized caRdiac output Estimation), predicted CO with an MAPE of 14% (P < 0.001 vs eFick) and an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.58. These estimates could be calculated from measurements obtained with either a pulmonary artery catheter or a central venous catheter. The CORE model was also robust to the presence of moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, achieving an MAPE of 16% and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.65 relative to a ground-truth determined by the direct Fick technique with measured oxygen consumption. CO models that account for dynamic physiology in ICU patients were more accurate than widely used eFick models and more versatile than TD. The performance of these models combined with their adaptation to vascular access, broad applicability, ease of use, and ease of deployment should enable them to benefit patients across diverse ICU settings.",Systems Biology,cardiac output co quintessential property cardiovascular system one whose estimation vital patient care critical illness common techniques assessing co thermodilution td estimated fick efick approximation force tradeoffs motivate need new methods purpose study novel co estimators fill key gaps critical care medicine machine learning used estimate co physiology measurements made routine clinical care intensive care unit icu cardiac catheterization lab models trained validated using curated set groundtruth measurements tdco patients model performance evaluated using regression metrics trajectory analysis classification accuracy co tracking three established efick models performed poorly icu static estimates oxygen consumption could track dynamics critical illness postcardiac surgery intensive care unit best efick model erred co predictions mean absolute percentage error mape coefficient determination rsupsup best model derived labeled core catheter optimized cardiac output estimation predicted co mape p vs efick rsupsup estimates could calculated measurements obtained either pulmonary artery catheter central venous catheter core model also robust presence moderate severe tricuspid regurgitation achieving mape rsupsup relative groundtruth determined direct fick technique measured oxygen consumption co models account dynamic physiology icu patients accurate widely used efick models versatile td performance models combined adaptation vascular access broad applicability ease use ease deployment enable benefit patients across diverse icu settings,Systems Biology

"Liver regeneration is a well-organized and phase-restricted process that involves chromatin remodeling and transcriptional alterations. However, the specific transcription factors (TFs) that act as key ""switches"" to initiate hepatocyte regeneration and organoid formation remain unclear. Comprehensive integration of RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing reveals that ATF3 representing ""Initiation_on"" TF and ONECUT2 representing ""Initiation_off"" TF transiently modulate the occupancy of target promoters to license liver cells for regeneration. Knockdown of Atf3 or overexpression of Onecut2 not only reduces organoid formation but also delays tissue-damage repair after PHx or CCl<sub>4</sub> treatment. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that ATF3 binds to the promoter of Slc7a5 to activate mTOR signals while the Hmgcs1 promoter loses ONECUT2 binding to facilitate regenerative initiation.

"Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most invasive central nervous system tumors, with rising global incidence. Therapy resistance and poor prognosis highlight the urgent need for new anticancer drugs. Plant alkaloids, a largely unexplored yet promising class of compounds, have previously contributed to oncology treatments. While past reviews provided selective insights, this review aims to collectively compare data from the last decade on (1) plant alkaloid-based anticancer drugs, (2) alkaloid transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and in vivo, (3) alkaloid mechanisms of action in glioblastoma models (in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico), and (4) cytotoxicity and safety profiles. Additionally, innovative drug delivery systems (e.g., nanoparticles and liposomes) are discussed. Focusing on preclinical studies of single plant alkaloids, this review includes 22 botanical families and 28 alkaloids that demonstrated anti-GBM activity. Most alkaloids act in a concentration-dependent manner by (1) reducing glioma cell viability, (2) suppressing proliferation, (3) inhibiting migration and invasion, (4) inducing cell death, (5) downregulating Bcl-2 and key signaling pathways, (6) exhibiting antiangiogenic effects, (7) reducing tumor weight, and (8) improving survival rates. The toxic and adverse effect analysis suggests that alkaloids such as noscapine, lycorine, capsaicin, chelerythrine, caffeine, boldine, and colchicine show favorable therapeutic potential. However, tetrandrine, nitidine, harmine, harmaline, cyclopamine, cocaine, and brucine may pose greater risks than benefits. Piperine's toxicity and berberine's poor bioavailability suggest the need for novel drug formulations.

"A concerted five-component reaction strategy has been developed, featuring double [3+2] cycloadditions utilizing aspartic acid. This approach provides valuable insights into mechanistic pathways, allowing for the distinction between concerted and stepwise processes based on reaction efficiency and diastereoselectivity. Both aspartic and glutamic acids have been employed for a thorough evaluation and exploration of decarboxylation-driven double annulations. This method effectively constructs pyrrolizidine frameworks through a concerted double 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with aspartic acid, as well as tetrahydropyrrolizinones via three-component double annulations, which include decarboxylative 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and lactamization with glutamic acid.

"Chronic wounds not only cause significant patient morbidity but also impose a substantial economic burden on the healthcare system. The primary barriers to wound healing include a deficiency of key modulatory factors needed to progress beyond the stalled inflammatory phase and an increased susceptibility to infections. While antimicrobial agents have traditionally been used to treat infections, stem cells have recently emerged as a promising therapy due to their regenerative properties, including the secretion of cytokines and immunomodulators that support wound healing. This study aims to develop an advanced dual-delivery system integrating stem cells and antibiotics. Stem cells have previously been delivered by encapsulation in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels. To explore a more effective delivery method, GelMA was processed into microparticles (MP). Compared to a bulk GelMA hydrogel (HG) encapsulation, GelMA MP supported greater cell growth and enhanced in vitro wound healing activity of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), likely due to a larger surface area for cell attachment and improved nutrient exchange. To incorporate antimicrobial properties, the broad-spectrum antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin (PS) were loaded into a bulk GelMA hydrogel, which was then cryo-milled into MPs to serve as carriers for hMSCs. To achieve a more sustained antibiotic release, gelatin nanoparticles (NP) were used as carriers for PS. PS was either incorporated during NP synthesis (NP+PS(S)) or absorbed into NP after synthesis (NP+PS(A)). MPs containing PS, NP+PS(S), or NP+PS(A) were tested for their cell carrier functions and antibacterial activities. The incorporation of PS did not compromise the cell-carrying function of MP configurations. The anti-<i>S. aureus</i> activity was detected in conditioned media from MPs for up to eight days-four days longer than from bulk HG containing PS. Notably, the presence of hMSCs prolonged the antimicrobial activity of MPs, suggesting a synergistic effect between stem cells and antibiotics. PS loaded via synthesis (NP+PS(S)) exhibited a delayed initial release, whereas PS loaded via absorption (NP+PS(A)) provided a more immediate release, with potential for sustained delivery.

"Sarcopenia, characterized by the degeneration of skeletal muscle tissue, has emerged as a significant concern in recent years. This increased awareness stems from advances in research focusing on elderly patients, which have revealed correlations between aging mechanisms and muscle degeneration, beyond the mere fact that tissues age and deteriorate over time. Consequently, the present study aims to address sarcopenia by developing and evaluating DPPC lipid vesicles that encapsulate three distinct drugs: HMB, NMN, and L-Leucine. These drugs are specifically selected for their properties, which facilitate effective interaction with the affected muscle tissue, thereby promoting desired therapeutic effects. Preliminary physicochemical analyses indicate the successful formation of spherical lipid vesicles, characterized by nanometric dimensions and stable membrane integrity. The biological investigations aimed to highlight the potential of DPPC lipid vesicles encapsulating HMB, NMN, and L-Leucine to alleviate sarcopenia-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Through a comparative evaluation of the three drug formulations, we demonstrate that drug-loaded DPPC vesicles effectively mitigate oxidative damage, preserve mitochondrial function, and maintain cytoskeletal integrity in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced C2C12 myotubes, with HMB-loaded vesicles showing the strongest protective effects against muscle degeneration. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of DPPC-based controlled release systems for sarcopenia treatment and highlight the need for further investigations into their mechanistic role in muscle preservation.",Systems Biology,sarcopenia characterized degeneration skeletal muscle tissue emerged significant concern recent years increased awareness stems advances research focusing elderly patients revealed correlations aging mechanisms muscle degeneration beyond mere fact tissues age deteriorate time consequently present study aims address sarcopenia developing evaluating dppc lipid vesicles encapsulate three distinct drugs hmb nmn lleucine drugs specifically selected properties facilitate effective interaction affected muscle tissue thereby promoting desired therapeutic effects preliminary physicochemical analyses indicate successful formation spherical lipid vesicles characterized nanometric dimensions stable membrane integrity biological investigations aimed highlight potential dppc lipid vesicles encapsulating hmb nmn lleucine alleviate sarcopeniainduced cytotoxicity oxidative stress comparative evaluation three drug formulations demonstrate drugloaded dppc vesicles effectively mitigate oxidative damage preserve mitochondrial function maintain cytoskeletal integrity hsubsubosubsubinduced cc myotubes hmbloaded vesicles showing strongest protective effects muscle degeneration findings underscore therapeutic potential dppcbased controlled release systems sarcopenia treatment highlight need investigations mechanistic role muscle preservation,Systems Biology
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease with complex etiologies, including genetic factors. Sex hormones have been implicated in MS pathogenesis, but the underlying genetic mechanisms remain unclear.This study employed a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the causal associations between sex hormone-related genes and MS. We utilized summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and blood-based methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), expression QTL (eQTLs), and proteomic QTL (pQTLs). The analysis employed the summary data-based MR (SMR) method and the HEIDI test for pleiotropy. Colocalization analysis identified shared genetic determinants, validated in UK Biobank and FinnGen R10 cohort. Our study identified a total of 30 mQTLs and 15 eQTLs that confirmed the causal associations between sex hormone-related genes and MS by SMR and colocalization analyses. Notably, the methylation site cg19286687 of the DES gene was positively associated with MS risk. Similarly, DES expression was positively associated with MS risk in eQTL data. Integration of mQTL and eQTL data revealed a positive regulatory association between cg19286687 and DES expression, suggesting that low methylation level of cg19286687 may inhibit DES expression, potentially contributing to MS risk reduction. This multi-omics MR study suggests a potential causal association between sex hormone-related genes and MS.

"Tonsils play a crucial role in the immune systems, and infections that involve them among the most common human illnesses, particularly in children. Recurrent adenotonsillitis prevails in such age and accounts for the primary reason for visits to primary care physicians. Adenotonsillectomy represents the most regularly performed surgical operations in children. While the effects of chronic adenotonsillitis (chronic inflammatory hypertrophy) on immune systems before and after adenotonsillectomy in children are not fully understood. This study aimed to showcase the bacterial pathogens associated with chronic adenotonsillitis, and to assess the impact of adenotonsillectomy on humoral immunity in children at the time of surgery and 3 months following the procedure. The study included 35 children scheduled for adenotonsillectomy, and 35 normal children as a control group. Throat bacterial cultures, and blood samples were taken at surgery time and three months after surgery. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was among the most frequent pathogens. IgM, IgG, and IgA levels were significantly decreased after surgery compared to before surgery time (p < 0. 01). Significant changes were also seen when compared to the controls (p < 0.01). Prior to surgery, serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were substantially greater than those following surgery and compared to controls (p < 0.01). According to our findings, adenotonsillectomy lowers long-term immune dysfunction without creating chronic immunological activation. In conclusion, while adenotonsillectomy initially lowers humoral immune responses, these levels return to normal within a few months of surgery. This indicates a transitory reduction in chronic immunological activation without long-term negative consequences on immune function.",Systems Biology,tonsils play crucial role immune systems infections involve among common human illnesses particularly children recurrent adenotonsillitis prevails age accounts primary reason visits primary care physicians adenotonsillectomy represents regularly performed surgical operations children effects chronic adenotonsillitis chronic inflammatory hypertrophy immune systems adenotonsillectomy children fully understood study aimed showcase bacterial pathogens associated chronic adenotonsillitis assess impact adenotonsillectomy humoral immunity children time surgery months following procedure study included children scheduled adenotonsillectomy normal children control group throat bacterial cultures blood samples taken surgery time three months surgery methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus among frequent pathogens igm igg iga levels significantly decreased surgery compared surgery time p significant changes also seen compared controls p prior surgery serum interleukin il levels substantially greater following surgery compared controls p according findings adenotonsillectomy lowers longterm immune dysfunction without creating chronic immunological activation conclusion adenotonsillectomy initially lowers humoral immune responses levels return normal within months surgery indicates transitory reduction chronic immunological activation without longterm negative consequences immune function,Systems Biology
"The dissociation or off rate, <i>k</i><sub>off</sub>, of a drug molecule has been shown to be more relevant to efficacy than affinity for selected systems, motivating the development of predictive computational methodologies. These are largely based on enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that come at a high computational cost limiting their utility for drug design where a large number of ligands need to be evaluated. To overcome this, presented is a combined physics- and machine learning (ML)-based approach that uses the physics-based site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) method to enumerate potential ligand dissociation pathways and calculate ligand dissociation free-energy profiles along those pathways. The calculated free-energy profiles along with molecular properties are used as features to train ML models, including tree and neural network approaches, to predict <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> values. The protocol is developed and validated using 329 ligands for 13 proteins showing robustness of the ML workflow built upon the SILCS physics-based free-energy profiles. The resulting SILCS-Kinetics workflow offers a highly efficient method to study ligand dissociation kinetics, providing a powerful tool to facilitate drug design including the ability to generate quantitative estimates of atomic and functional groups contributions to ligand dissociation.",Systems Biology,dissociation rate ikisuboffsub drug molecule shown relevant efficacy affinity selected systems motivating development predictive computational methodologies largely based enhancedsampling molecular dynamics md simulations come high computational cost limiting utility drug design large number ligands need evaluated overcome presented combined physics machine learning mlbased approach uses physicsbased site identification ligand competitive saturation silcs method enumerate potential ligand dissociation pathways calculate ligand dissociation freeenergy profiles along pathways calculated freeenergy profiles along molecular properties used features train ml models including tree neural network approaches predict ikisuboffsub values protocol developed validated using ligands proteins showing robustness ml workflow built upon silcs physicsbased freeenergy profiles resulting silcskinetics workflow offers highly efficient method study ligand dissociation kinetics providing powerful tool facilitate drug design including ability generate quantitative estimates atomic functional groups contributions ligand dissociation,Systems Biology
"The accurate construction of computational models in systems biology heavily relies on the availability of quantitative proteomics data, specifically, absolute protein abundances. However, the complex nature of proteomics data analysis necessitates specialised expertise, making the integration of this data into models challenging. Therefore, the development of software tools that ease the analysis of proteomics data and bridge between disciplines is crucial for advancing the field of systems biology. We developed an open access Python-based software tool available either as downloadable library or as web-based graphical user interface (GUI). The pipeline simplifies the extraction and calculation of protein abundances from unprocessed proteomics data, accommodating a range of experimental approaches based on label-free quantification.

"Many angiosperms have evolved specialized systems that promote pollination by specific taxa. Therefore, plant distributions may be limited by the local abundance of their specialist pollinators. In eastern North America, Lobelia cardinalis is thought to be pollinated solely by Archilochus colubris, the only hummingbird species found in the region. Here we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of a plant species with specialized pollination is controlled by the range and abundance of its specialist pollinator. We investigated the importance of A. colubris abundance, sourced from eBird, as a variable in a MaxEnt species distribution model of L. cardinalis using presence data from iNaturalist. We also compared hummingbird abundance between locations of L. cardinalis and congeneric during their respective flowering periods and explored whether the flowering periods of L. cardinalis and congenerics align with the week of peak local hummingbird abundance. Unexpectedly, MaxEnt modelling did not suggest that A. colubris abundance is a key driver of the species distribution. Lobelia cardinalis habitat suitability was lowest in the absence of A. colubris and increased with increasing abundance, but habitat suitability was also low in regions where hummingbird abundance is highest. Still, hummingbird abundance at L. cardinalis locations was generally higher than most congenerics, and L. cardinalis tended to flower near the week of local peak A. colubris abundance. While populations of hummingbird-pollinated plant species may require the local presence of hummingbirds, fine-scale variation in hummingbird abundance may not strongly influence their spatial distributions.",Systems Biology,many angiosperms evolved specialized systems promote pollination specific taxa therefore plant distributions may limited local abundance specialist pollinators eastern north america lobelia cardinalis thought pollinated solely archilochus colubris hummingbird species found region tested hypothesis distribution plant species specialized pollination controlled range abundance specialist pollinator investigated importance colubris abundance sourced ebird variable maxent species distribution model l cardinalis using presence data inaturalist also compared hummingbird abundance locations l cardinalis congeneric respective flowering periods explored whether flowering periods l cardinalis congenerics align week peak local hummingbird abundance unexpectedly maxent modelling suggest colubris abundance key driver species distribution lobelia cardinalis habitat suitability lowest absence colubris increased increasing abundance habitat suitability also low regions hummingbird abundance highest still hummingbird abundance l cardinalis locations generally higher congenerics l cardinalis tended flower near week local peak colubris abundance populations hummingbirdpollinated plant species may require local presence hummingbirds finescale variation hummingbird abundance may strongly influence spatial distributions,Systems Biology
"Age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, known as sarcopenia, is characterized by loss of muscle mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity. Although exercise has been shown to mitigate sarcopenia, the underlying governing mechanisms are poorly understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in aging and sarcopenia; however, few studies explore how mitochondrial structure contributes to this dysfunction. In this study, we sought to understand how aging impacts mitochondrial three-dimensional (3D) structure and its regulators in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that aging leads to remodeling of mitochondrial 3D architecture permissive to dysfunction and is ameliorated by exercise. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and Amira software, mitochondrial 3D reconstructions from patient biopsies were generated and analyzed. Across five human cohorts, we correlate differences in magnetic resonance imaging, mitochondria 3D structure, exercise parameters, and plasma immune markers between young (under 50 years) and old (over 50 years) individuals. We found that mitochondria are less spherical and more complex, indicating age-related declines in contact site capacity. Additionally, aged samples showed a larger volume phenotype in both female and male humans, indicating potential mitochondrial swelling. Concomitantly, muscle area, exercise capacity, and mitochondrial dynamic proteins showed age-related losses. Exercise stimulation restored mitofusin 2 (MFN2), one such of these mitochondrial dynamic proteins, which we show is required for the integrity of mitochondrial structure. Furthermore, we show that this pathway is evolutionarily conserved, as Marf, the MFN2 ortholog in Drosophila, knockdown alters mitochondrial morphology and leads to the downregulation of genes regulating mitochondrial processes. Our results define age-related structural changes in mitochondria and further suggest that exercise may mitigate age-related structural decline through modulation of mitofusin 2.",Systems Biology,agerelated skeletal muscle atrophy known sarcopenia characterized loss muscle mass strength endurance oxidative capacity although exercise shown mitigate sarcopenia underlying governing mechanisms poorly understood mitochondrial dysfunction implicated aging sarcopenia however studies explore mitochondrial structure contributes dysfunction study sought understand aging impacts mitochondrial threedimensional structure regulators skeletal muscle hypothesized aging leads remodeling mitochondrial architecture permissive dysfunction ameliorated exercise using serial blockface scanning electron microscopy sbfsem amira software mitochondrial reconstructions patient biopsies generated analyzed across five human cohorts correlate differences magnetic resonance imaging mitochondria structure exercise parameters plasma immune markers young years old years individuals found mitochondria less spherical complex indicating agerelated declines contact site capacity additionally aged samples showed larger volume phenotype female male humans indicating potential mitochondrial swelling concomitantly muscle area exercise capacity mitochondrial dynamic proteins showed agerelated losses exercise stimulation restored mitofusin mfn one mitochondrial dynamic proteins show required integrity mitochondrial structure furthermore show pathway evolutionarily conserved marf mfn ortholog drosophila knockdown alters mitochondrial morphology leads downregulation genes regulating mitochondrial processes results define agerelated structural changes mitochondria suggest exercise may mitigate agerelated structural decline modulation mitofusin,Systems Biology
"Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for detecting emerging variants and informing public health responses. Various sequencing technologies are used for whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. This cross-platform benchmark study applied established bioinformatics tools to assess and improve the performance of Illumina NovaSeq, Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, and Pacific Biosciences Sequel II sequencing platforms in identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants and lineage assignment. NovaSeq produced the highest number of reads and bases, depth of coverage, completeness of consensus genomes, stable mapping coverage across open reading frames in the genome, and consistent lineage assignments. The long-read sequencing platforms had lower yields, sequencing depth, and mapping coverage, limiting the number of qualified sequences for lineage assignment and variant identification. However, implementing proper quality controls on sequence data overcame these limitations and achieved consistent SARS-CoV-2 lineage assignments across all three sequencing platforms. The advancements in library preparation and technology for long-read sequencing are likely to enhance sequence quality and expand genome coverage, effectively addressing current limitations in genome analysis. By merging the unique advantages of both short- and long-read methods, we can significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and provide insights into sequencing strategies for other RNA viruses, pending further validation.

"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a pathogen that causes severe neurological dysfunction in the host, leading to extensive neuronal damage and inflammation. Despite extensive research on the neuropathogenesis of α-herpesvirus infections, many scientific questions remain unresolved, such as the largely unknown functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in herpesvirus-infected nervous systems. To address these questions, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the brains of mice infected with PRV. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified 316 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 886 differentially expressed mRNAs. We predicted the biological functions of these differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, and the results showed that the differentially expressed transcripts were mainly involved in the innate immune response. Finally, we validated the differential expression trends of lncRNAs and mRNAs using quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR), which were consistent with the sequencing data. To our knowledge, this is the first report analyzing the lncRNA expression profile in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice infected with PRV.

"Vaccination remains the most effective strategy for preventing infectious diseases. Subunit vaccines, which consist of antigenic components derived from pathogens, offer significant advantages in terms of biosafety, ease of preparation, and scalability. However, subunit vaccines often exhibit lower immunogenicity than whole-pathogen vaccines do. To address this limitation, coupling antigens with nanoparticles has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing immune responses by mimicking pathogen structures and improving antigen presentation. This study evaluated the stability of ferritin (F-nps) and encapsulin (E-nps) nanoparticles and their efficient uptake by bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated their effective targeting of lymph nodes. The African swine fever virus C129R protein was conjugated to ferritin and encapsulin nanoparticles to assess its ability to enhance antigen-specific immune responses. In murine models, both F-nps and E-nps significantly increased the immunogenicity of the C129R antigen, highlighting their potential as effective vaccine delivery systems.

"(1) Background: Respiratory viral infections, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, are major causes of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children. Symptom-based predictive models are valuable tools for expediting diagnoses, particularly in primary care settings. This study assessed the effectiveness of machine learning-based models in estimating infection probabilities for these common pediatric respiratory viruses, using symptom data. (2) Methods: Data were collected from 868 children with ARI symptoms evaluated across 14 primary care centers, members of COPEDICAT (Coronavirus Pediatria Catalunya), from October 2021 to October 2023. Random forest and boosting models with 10-fold cross-validation were used, applying SMOTE-NC to address class imbalance.

Predictive performance was lower for non-enveloped viruses like rhinovirus and adenovirus, due to their nonspecific symptom profiles. SHAP analysis identified key symptoms patterns for each virus.

"Milk fever, or periparturient hypocalcemia, in dairy cows has traditionally been addressed as an acute calcium deficiency, leading to interventions like supplementation and adjustments in dietary cation-anion balance. Although these measures have improved clinical outcomes, milk fever remains a widespread and economically significant issue for the dairy industry. Emerging findings demonstrate that a narrow emphasis on blood calcium concentration overlooks the complex interactions of immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Inflammatory mediators and bacterial endotoxins can compromise hormone-driven calcium regulation and induce compensatory calcium sequestration, thereby worsening both clinical and subclinical hypocalcemia. Recent insights from systems biology illustrate that milk fever arises from nonlinear interactions among various physiological networks, rather than a single deficiency. Consequently, this review contends that a holistic strategy including integrating nutrition, immunology, microbiology, genetics, and endocrinology is vital for comprehensive management and prevention of milk fever. By embracing a multidisciplinary perspective, producers and veterinarians can develop more robust, customized solutions that not only safeguard animal well-being but also bolster profitability. Such an approach promises to meet the evolving demands of modern dairy operations by reducing disease prevalence and enhancing overall productivity.

Understanding the complex interactions among microbial communities in relation to age, management, and health is a topic of growing interest. The equine microbiota, given its complexity, is subject to variations caused by internal or external stressors that can lead to metabolic problems and pathologies, i.e., obesity and laminitis. The aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbiota of 12 purebred Arabian horses and to compare the microbial communities in two distinct management systems (Group 1 = box 22 h/day + paddock 2 h/day and Group 2 = paddock 24 h). Fecal samples were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V3-V4 amplicons. The microbiota was predominantly composed of Firmicutes (32-53%) and Bacteroidetes (32-47.8%), with Ruminococcaceae emerging as the most prevalent bacterial family (10.9-24%). Comparisons of alpha and beta diversity revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups based on different management systems.

"The increasing prevalence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a serious concern for public health. <i>Aeromonas caviae</i> is a pathogenic microorganism that causes a wide spectrum of diseases in fish and humans and is often associated with aquatic environments and isolated from foods and animals. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of the V15<sup>T</sup> strain isolated from a drinking water storage tank in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The V15<sup>T</sup> strain has a genome length of 4,443,347 bp with an average G + C content of 61.78% and a total of 4028 open reading frames. Its genome harbors eight types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) involving resistance to beta-lactamases, macrolides, and quinolones. The presence of <i>bla<sub>MOX-6</sub></i>, <i>bla<sub>OXA-427</sub>/bla<sub>OXA-504</sub></i>, and mutations in <i>parC</i> were detected. In addition, other ARGs (<i>macA</i>, <i>macB</i>, <i>opmH</i>, and <i>qnrA</i>) and multidrug efflux pumps (such as <i>MdtL</i>), along with several resistance determinants and 106 genes encoding virulence factors, including adherence (polar and lateral flagella), secretion (T2SS, T6SS), toxin (<i>hlyA</i>), and stress adaptation (<i>katG</i>) systems, were observed. The genome sequence reported here provides insights into antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, evolution, and virulence in <i>Aeromonas</i> strains, highlighting the need for more public health attention and the further monitoring of drinking water systems. Also, the results of physiological and phylogenetic data, average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculation, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) analysis support the inclusion of the strain V15<sup>T</sup> in the genus <i>Aeromonas</i> as a new subspecies with the proposed name <i>Aeromonas caviae</i> subsp. <i>aquatica</i> subsp. nov. (V15<sup>T</sup> = P53320<sup>T</sup>).

"Circadian rhythms are innate biological systems that control everyday behavior and physiology. Furthermore, bilateral interaction between the host's circadian rhythm and the gut microbes influences a variety of health ramifications, including metabolic diseases, obesity, and mental health including GALT physiology and the microbiome population. Therefore, we are studying the correlation between differential gene expression in the chicken brain and microbiota abundance during circadian rhythms. To understand this, we raised freshly hatched chicks under two photoperiod treatments: normal photoperiod (NP = 12/12 LD) and extended photoperiod (EP 23/1 LD). The chicks were randomly assigned to one of two treatments. After 21 days of circadian entrainment, the chicks were euthanized at nine time points spaced six hours apart over 48 h to characterize the brain transcriptomes. Each sample's RNA was extracted, and 36 mRNA libraries were generated and sequenced using Illumina technology, followed by data processing, count data generation, and differential gene expression analysis. We generated an average of 17.5 million reads per library for 237.9 M reads. When aligned to the Galgal6 reference genome, 11,867 genes had detectable expression levels, with a common dispersion value of 0.105. To identify the genes that follow 24 h rhythms, counts per million data were performed in DiscoRhythm. We discovered 577 genes with Cosinor and 417 with the JTK cycle algorithm that exhibit substantial rhythms. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze the correlation between differentially expressed genes and microbiota abundance. The most enriched pathways included aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, GABAergic synapse, oxidative phosphorylation, serotonergic synapse, dopaminergic synapse and circadian entrainment. This study builds on our previous study, and adds new findings about the specific interactions and co-regulation of the brain transcriptome and the gut microbiota.

"This review article highlights the surveillance of bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases in donkey populations in China. Key findings highlight significant threats from Equine herpesviruses (EHV-8 and EHV-1), which cause encephalitis, abortion, and respiratory distress. Several parasitic infections including <i>Giardia duodenalis</i>, <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp., <i>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</i>, and <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> present important zoonotic concerns across multiple regions of China. Additionally, this review synthesizes current knowledge on donkey microbiota across various body sites and examines their functional significance in health and disease. The complex relationship between the microbiota and host health represents a critical area of research in donkeys. Recent molecular advancements have enhanced our understanding of the diverse microbial ecosystems inhabiting different body sites in donkeys and their profound impact on health outcomes. As single-stomach herbivores, donkeys possess complex microbial communities throughout their digestive tracts that are essential for intestinal homeostasis and nutritional processing. Significant variations in microbiota composition exist across different intestinal segments, with the hindgut displaying greater richness and diversity compared to the foregut. Beyond the digestive system, distinct microbial profiles have been characterized across various body sites including the skin, oral cavity, reproductive tract, and body secretions such as milk. The health implications of donkey microbiota extend to critical areas including nutrition, immune function, and disease susceptibility. Research demonstrates how dietary interventions, environmental stressors, and physiological states significantly alter microbial communities, correlating with changes in inflammatory markers, antioxidant responses, and metabolic functions. Additionally, specific microbial signatures associated with conditions like endometritis and respiratory disease suggest the potential for microbiota-based diagnostics and therapeutics. The identification of antibiotic-resistant strains of <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> in donkey meat highlights food safety concerns requiring enhanced monitoring systems and standardized safety protocols.

"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems improve pharmacokinetic aspects, including controlled release and drug targeting, increasing therapeutic efficacy, and reducing toxicity in conventional colon cancer treatment. The superparamagnetism of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) appears to be a potential alternative for magnetothermal therapy, inducing tumor cell death by an external magnetic field. Therefore, this study aimed to develop chitosan (CS) and folate-chitosan (FA-CS)-coated MNP to improve the stability and targeting of the system for quercetin (Q) delivery. <b>Methods</b>: After FA-CS synthesis and 3<sup>2</sup> factorial design, polymer-functionalized MNPs were produced for quercetin loading, characterized, and evaluated by drug dissolution and cytotoxicity assay. <b>Results</b>: The factorial design indicated the positive influence of CS on MNPs' Zeta potential, followed by the CS-temperature interaction. Optimized formulations had hydrodynamic diameters of 122.32 ± 8.56 nm, Zeta potentials of +30.78 ± 0.8 mV, and loading efficiencies of 80.45% (MNP-CS-Q) and 54.4% (MNP-FA-CS-Q). The 24 h drug release was controlled in MNP-CS-Q (up to 6.4%) and MNP-FA-CS-Q (up to 7.7%) in a simulated tumor medium, with Fickian diffusion release mechanism correlated to the Korsmeyer-Peppas model (R > 0.99).

"<b>Background</b>: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) have independently been used for DNA complexation and delivery. However, non-ideal gene delivery efficiency and toxicity have hindered their clinical translation. We developed DNA-PEI-LNPs as a strategy to overcome these limitations and enhance DNA delivery and transgene expression. <b>Methods</b>: Three microfluidic mixing protocols were evaluated: (i) LNPs without PEI, (ii) a single-step process incorporating PEI in the organic phase, and (iii) a two-step process with DNA pre-complexed with PEI before LNP incorporation. The influence of DNA/PEI ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3) and DNA/lipid ratios (1:10, 1:40) on particle properties and delivery efficiency was examined. <b>Results</b>: In luciferase formulations, higher DNA/lipid ratios (1:40) produced smaller particles (136 nm vs. 188 nm) with improved cellular uptake (77% vs. 50%).

"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The growing diversity of novel nanoparticle synthesis methods, particularly for silver nanoparticles (AgNP), coupled with their significant biological activity and wide range of applications across various medical fields, necessitates a comprehensive investigation into the consequences of particle-induced cellular damage. This study aimed to investigate AgNP-induced damage to macrophage plasma membranes, focusing on concentration, temperature, incubation time, and the role of pro- and antioxidant factors, using model systems based on mouse peritoneal macrophages. <b>Methods:</b> Mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with AgNP (0.1-10 μg/mL) at temperatures ranging from 4 °C to 37 °C. Membrane integrity was assessed via microfluorimetric analysis. The influence of prooxidant (UV-B) and antioxidant (serotonin) factors was also examined. A mathematical model was developed to describe the interaction between AgNP and macrophages. <b>Results:</b> The diameter of our synthesized silver nanoparticles, assessed via dynamic light scattering (DLS), ranged from 5 to 170 nm, with a predominant size distribution peak at 70 nm. AgNP caused dose- and temperature-dependent membrane damage, which was more pronounced at 4 °C and 37 °C than at 22 °C and increased with incubation time. UV-B enhanced membrane damage, while serotonin mitigated it. The mathematical model correlated strongly with the experimental data, emphasizing the role of ROS in membrane disruption. AgNP also dose-dependently increased ROS generation by macrophages. <b>Conclusions:</b> AgNP, in doses of 0.1-10 μg/mL, induces dose-dependent membrane damage in macrophages. The developed model is a useful tool for predicting nanoparticle toxicity.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide due to its resistance to conventional therapies that is attributed to its dense and acidic tumor microenvironment. Chemotherapy based on gemcitabine usually lacks efficacy due to poor drug penetration and the metabolic characteristics of the cells adapted to grow at a more acidic pH<sub>e</sub>, thus presenting a more aggressive phenotype. In this context, photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a promising alternative since it generally does not suffer from the same patterns of cross-resistance observed with chemotherapy drugs. In the present work, a novel bromine-substituted heptamethine-cyanine dye (BrCY7) was synthesized, loaded into PEG-PLGA NPs, and tested on the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line cultured under physiological (PANC-1 CT) and acidic (PANC-1 pH selected) conditions, which promotes the selection of a more aggressive phenotype. The cytotoxicity of BrCY7-PEG-PLGA is dose-dependent, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.15 µM in PANC-1 CT and 2.87 µM in PANC-1 pH selected. Notably, BrCY7-PEG-PLGA demonstrated a phototoxic effect against PANC-1 pH selected cells but not on PANC-1 CT, which makes these findings particularly relevant since PANC-1 pH selected cells are more resistant to gemcitabine as compared with PANC-1 CT cells.",Systems Biology,pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac one deadliest cancers worldwide due resistance conventional therapies attributed dense acidic tumor microenvironment chemotherapy based gemcitabine usually lacks efficacy due poor drug penetration metabolic characteristics cells adapted grow acidic phsubesub thus presenting aggressive phenotype context photodynamic therapy pdt offers promising alternative since generally suffer patterns crossresistance observed chemotherapy drugs present work novel brominesubstituted heptamethinecyanine dye brcy synthesized loaded pegplga nps tested pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line cultured physiological panc ct acidic panc ph selected conditions promotes selection aggressive phenotype cytotoxicity brcypegplga dosedependent icsubsub panc ct panc ph selected notably brcypegplga demonstrated phototoxic effect panc ph selected cells panc ct makes findings particularly relevant since panc ph selected cells resistant gemcitabine compared panc ct cells,Systems Biology
"<b>Background</b>: Diet is one of the most significant modifiable lifestyle factors influencing human health, contributing to both morbidity and mortality. Genetic variations in the pleiotropic 9p21 risk locus further shape premature aging, disease susceptibility, and have been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic disorders, certain cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. However, given that this region was discovered based on Genome-Wide Association Studies, the mechanisms by which 9p21 exerts its effects remain poorly understood and its interactions with diet and biomarkers are insufficiently explored. <b>Methods</b>: This study investigated the association between the rs2383206 SNP in 9p21, dietary patterns, and plasma proteomic biomarkers in a multi-ethnic cohort of 1280 young adults from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. Participants' dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were categorized using principal component analysis. Plasma proteomics analyses quantified 54 abundant proteins involved in the cardiometabolic and inflammatory pathways. Genotyping identified individuals who were homozygous for the 9p21 risk allele (GG), known to confer the highest susceptibility risk to premature aging and multiple chronic diseases. <b>Results</b>: A significant interaction was observed between the 9p21 genotype and adherence to a micronutrient-rich Prudent dietary pattern for eight plasma proteins (α<sub>1</sub> Antichymotrypsin, Complement C4 β chain, Complement C4 γ chain, Complement C9, Fibrinogen α chain, Hemopexin, and Serum amyloid P-component). However, only Complement C4-γ showed a pattern consistent with the risks associated with the 9p21 genotype and adherence to a Prudent diet. Individuals with the high-risk GG genotype had significantly higher concentrations of Complement C4-γ, but only among those with a low adherence to a Prudent diet. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings suggest that Prudent dietary patterns rich in micronutrients may counteract genetic-mediated proinflammatory susceptibility by modulating key proteomic biomarkers in young adults, highlighting the potential for tailored dietary interventions to mitigate disease risk. This study also introduces a novel framework for post hoc micronutrient resolution within dietary pattern analysis, offering a new lens to interpret nutrient synergies in gene-diet interaction research.",Systems Biology,bbackgroundb diet one significant modifiable lifestyle factors influencing human health contributing morbidity mortality genetic variations pleiotropic p risk locus shape premature aging disease susceptibility strongly linked cardiovascular disease cvd metabolic disorders certain cancers neurodegenerative conditions however given region discovered based genomewide association studies mechanisms p exerts effects remain poorly understood interactions diet biomarkers insufficiently explored bmethodsb study investigated association rs snp p dietary patterns plasma proteomic biomarkers multiethnic cohort young adults toronto nutrigenomics health study participants dietary intake assessed using validated food frequency questionnaire dietary patterns categorized using principal component analysis plasma proteomics analyses quantified abundant proteins involved cardiometabolic inflammatory pathways genotyping identified individuals homozygous p risk allele gg known confer highest susceptibility risk premature aging multiple chronic diseases bresultsb significant interaction observed p genotype adherence micronutrientrich prudent dietary pattern eight plasma proteins subsub antichymotrypsin complement c chain complement c chain complement c fibrinogen chain hemopexin serum amyloid pcomponent however complement c showed pattern consistent risks associated p genotype adherence prudent diet individuals highrisk gg genotype significantly higher concentrations complement c among low adherence prudent diet bconclusionsb findings suggest prudent dietary patterns rich micronutrients may counteract geneticmediated proinflammatory susceptibility modulating key proteomic biomarkers young adults highlighting potential tailored dietary interventions mitigate disease risk study also introduces novel framework post hoc micronutrient resolution within dietary pattern analysis offering new lens interpret nutrient synergies genediet interaction research,Systems Biology
"<i>Astragalus membranaceus</i>, a plant that has been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, is widely regarded as one of the most valuable herbs in this medicinal tradition.

"Castor bean (<i>Ricinus communis</i> L.) can tolerate long periods of dehydration, allowing the investigation of gene circuits involved in drought tolerance. Genes from gibberellins, jasmonates, and auxin signaling are important for crosstalk in the developmental and environmental adaptation process to drought conditions. However, the genes related to these signals, as well as their transcription profiles under drought, remain poorly characterized in the castor bean. In the present work, genes from gibberellins, jasmonates, and auxin signaling were identified and molecularly characterized. These analyses allowed us to identify genes encoding receptors, inhibitory proteins, and transcription factors from each signaling pathway in the castor bean genome. Chromosomal distribution, gene structure, evolutionary relationships, and conserved motif analyses were performed. Expression analysis through RNA-seq and RT-qPCR revealed that gibberellins, jasmonates, and auxin signaling were modulated at multiple levels under drought, with notable changes in specific genes. The gibberellin receptor <i>RcGID1c</i> was downregulated in response to drought, and <i>RcDELLA3</i> was strongly repressed, whereas its homologues were not, reinforcing the suggestion of a nuanced regulation of gibberellin signaling during drought. Considering jasmonate signaling, the downregulation of the transcription factor <i>RcMYC2</i> aligned with the drought tolerance observed in mutants lacking this gene. Altogether, these analyses have provided insights into hormone signaling in the castor bean, unveiling transcriptional responses that enhance our understanding of high drought tolerance in this plant. This knowledge opens avenues for identifying potential candidate genes suitable for genetic manipulation in biotechnological approaches.",Systems Biology,castor bean iricinus communisi l tolerate long periods dehydration allowing investigation gene circuits involved drought tolerance genes gibberellins jasmonates auxin signaling important crosstalk developmental environmental adaptation process drought conditions however genes related signals well transcription profiles drought remain poorly characterized castor bean present work genes gibberellins jasmonates auxin signaling identified molecularly characterized analyses allowed us identify genes encoding receptors inhibitory proteins transcription factors signaling pathway castor bean genome chromosomal distribution gene structure evolutionary relationships conserved motif analyses performed expression analysis rnaseq rtqpcr revealed gibberellins jasmonates auxin signaling modulated multiple levels drought notable changes specific genes gibberellin receptor ircgidci downregulated response drought ircdellai strongly repressed whereas homologues reinforcing suggestion nuanced regulation gibberellin signaling drought considering jasmonate signaling downregulation transcription factor ircmyci aligned drought tolerance observed mutants lacking gene altogether analyses provided insights hormone signaling castor bean unveiling transcriptional responses enhance understanding high drought tolerance plant knowledge opens avenues identifying potential candidate genes suitable genetic manipulation biotechnological approaches,Systems Biology
"Orchidaceae is one of the most species-rich families of flowering plants, with most current diversity having evolved within the last 5 My. Patterns associated with species richness and rapid diversification have been identified but have not often been associated with evolutionary processes. We review the most frequently identified correlates of diversity and suggest that the processes and rate by which they occur vary geographically and are largely dependent on persistent pulses of habitat instabilities, especially for epiphytes. Aggressive orogenesis creates fragmented habitats while global climatic cycles exacerbate the ecological instabilities. The need for repeated cycles of dispersal results in frequent founder events, which sets the stage for allopatric diversification via bouts of genetic drift and natural selection. The allopatry requirement can be bypassed by pollination systems involving flowers attracting pollinators through the production of sex signaling semiochemicals. The drift-selection model of diversification, coupled with persistent habitat instability throughout ecological and geological time scales, and sex signaling are the likely components of a multifactorial process leading to the rapid, recent diversification in this family.",Systems Biology,orchidaceae one speciesrich families flowering plants current diversity evolved within last patterns associated species richness rapid diversification identified often associated evolutionary processes review frequently identified correlates diversity suggest processes rate occur vary geographically largely dependent persistent pulses habitat instabilities especially epiphytes aggressive orogenesis creates fragmented habitats global climatic cycles exacerbate ecological instabilities need repeated cycles dispersal results frequent founder events sets stage allopatric diversification via bouts genetic drift natural selection allopatry requirement bypassed pollination systems involving flowers attracting pollinators production sex signaling semiochemicals driftselection model diversification coupled persistent habitat instability throughout ecological geological time scales sex signaling likely components multifactorial process leading rapid recent diversification family,Systems Biology
"Human-caused habitat conversion, degradation, and climate change threaten global biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where vascular epiphytes-non-parasitic plants growing on other plants-may be especially vulnerable. Epiphytes play vital ecological roles, in nutrient cycling and by providing habitat, but are disproportionately affected by land-use changes due to their reliance on host trees and specific microclimatic conditions. While tree species in secondary forests recover relatively quickly, epiphyte recolonization is slower, especially in humid montane regions, where species richness may decline by up to 96% compared to primary or old-growth forests. A review of nearly 300 pertinent studies has revealed a geographic bias toward the Neotropics, with limited research from tropical Asia, Africa, and temperate regions. The studies can be grouped into four main areas: 1. trade, use and conservation, 2. ecological effects of climate and land-use change, 3. diversity in human-modified habitats, and 4. responses to disturbance. In agricultural and timber plantations, particularly those using exotic species like pine and eucalyptus, epiphyte diversity is significantly reduced. In contrast, most native tree species and shade-grown agroforestry systems support higher species richness. Traditional polycultures with dense canopy cover maintain up to 88% of epiphyte diversity, while intensive management practices, such as epiphyte removal in coffee and cacao plantations, cause substantial biodiversity losses. Conservation strategies should prioritize preserving old-growth forests, maintaining forest fragments, and minimizing intensive land management. Active restoration, including the translocation of fallen epiphytes and planting vegetation nuclei, is more effective than passive approaches. Future research should include long-term monitoring to understand epiphyte dynamics and assess the broader impacts of epiphyte loss on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",Systems Biology,humancaused habitat conversion degradation climate change threaten global biodiversity particularly tropical forests vascular epiphytesnonparasitic plants growing plantsmay especially vulnerable epiphytes play vital ecological roles nutrient cycling providing habitat disproportionately affected landuse changes due reliance host trees specific microclimatic conditions tree species secondary forests recover relatively quickly epiphyte recolonization slower especially humid montane regions species richness may decline compared primary oldgrowth forests review nearly pertinent studies revealed geographic bias toward neotropics limited research tropical asia africa temperate regions studies grouped four main areas trade use conservation ecological effects climate landuse change diversity humanmodified habitats responses disturbance agricultural timber plantations particularly using exotic species like pine eucalyptus epiphyte diversity significantly reduced contrast native tree species shadegrown agroforestry systems support higher species richness traditional polycultures dense canopy cover maintain epiphyte diversity intensive management practices epiphyte removal coffee cacao plantations cause substantial biodiversity losses conservation strategies prioritize preserving oldgrowth forests maintaining forest fragments minimizing intensive land management active restoration including translocation fallen epiphytes planting vegetation nuclei effective passive approaches future research include longterm monitoring understand epiphyte dynamics assess broader impacts epiphyte loss biodiversity ecosystem functioning,Systems Biology

"Despite lithium's presence in modern psychiatry for three-quarters of a century, the mechanisms of its therapeutic action have not been fully elucidated. This article presents the evolution of the views on these mechanisms, and both the old and new findings are discussed. Among the old mechanisms, lithium's effect on the purinergic system; electrolyte metabolism; membrane transport; and second messenger systems, namely, cyclic nucleotide and phosphatidylinositol (PI), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3β), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotransmitters, are discussed. The new data were obtained from in vitro studies, molecular biology, and genetic research. They showed the effects of lithium on the immune system, biological rhythms, telomere functions, and mitochondria. In this article, each lithium mechanism is considered in the light of its association with the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder or/and as a marker of the lithium response. Although not exhaustive, this review elucidates the multiple potential mechanisms of lithium action. It was also observed that many seemingly ""old"" mechanisms have experienced a resurgence in research conducted during the 21st century.

"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health problem, which the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated. Scaling TB, COVID-19, and coinfection in area and socioeconomic contexts is an important way to detect more vulnerable groups. To verify, through the spatial distribution of cases of tuberculosis, COVID-19, and coinfection, the existence of an association between the risk of illness and income. An analytical ecological study was carried out in Recife, whose unit of analysis was the neighborhood, in the year 2020. The data were collected from the SINAN-TB, NOTIFICA-PE, and IBGE Information Systems. Neighborhoods were grouped into strata according to income through K-means analysis. Incidence rates were calculated. Marshall's Local Empirical Bayesian Smoothing Method was used. Risk ratios were calculated to estimate the magnitude of association between income strata and incidence rates. A heterogeneous pattern of spatial distribution was verified for the three events addressed, compatible with the inequality of income distribution existing in Recife. For COVID-19, the highest incidence rates occurred in the strata of better-income neighborhoods. There was an association with a gradual increase in the incidence rate as income decreased for tuberculosis. Coinfection did not show a gradual increase in the incidence rate as income decreased, but a lower incidence rate was observed in the stratum of better economic conditions. Studies must be carried out to verify the spatial distribution of COVID-19 and its possible association with socioeconomic factors in subsequent years. There was a positive association between low income and the risk of becoming ill from tuberculosis. The lower incidence rate of coinfection in the stratum of the higher-income population suggests that the pre-existence of TB contributes to illness by COVID-19 in the low-income population.",Systems Biology,tuberculosis tb remains public health problem covid pandemic may exacerbated scaling tb covid coinfection area socioeconomic contexts important way detect vulnerable groups verify spatial distribution cases tuberculosis covid coinfection existence association risk illness income analytical ecological study carried recife whose unit analysis neighborhood year data collected sinantb notificape ibge information systems neighborhoods grouped strata according income kmeans analysis incidence rates calculated marshalls local empirical bayesian smoothing method used risk ratios calculated estimate magnitude association income strata incidence rates heterogeneous pattern spatial distribution verified three events addressed compatible inequality income distribution existing recife covid highest incidence rates occurred strata betterincome neighborhoods association gradual increase incidence rate income decreased tuberculosis coinfection show gradual increase incidence rate income decreased lower incidence rate observed stratum better economic conditions studies must carried verify spatial distribution covid possible association socioeconomic factors subsequent years positive association low income risk becoming ill tuberculosis lower incidence rate coinfection stratum higherincome population suggests preexistence tb contributes illness covid lowincome population,Systems Biology
"<i>Chromochloris zofingiensis</i> is a green alga that serves as a valuable source of lipids, proteins, and carotenoids. Compared to well-studied microalgal carotenoid producers, <i>C. zofingiensis</i> offers several advantages, including high biomass, lipid and carotenoid productivity as well as less susceptibility to contaminations. <i>C. zofingiensis</i> can achieve growth rates up to four times higher than those of <i>H. pluvialis</i> under optimal phototrophic conditions. Although several studies have examined its cultivation and carotenogenesis under different tropic growth modes at laboratory scale, few have focused on pilot-scale systems. The goal of this study is to investigate the microalga's physiological adaptation in a 200 L tubular photobioreactor during a three-phase semi-continuous cultivation strategy, particularly focusing on the changes in macromolecular and pigment composition. After an initial biomass accumulation phase, a two-phased stress phase was applied combining nutrient depletion (phase 1) and osmotic salt stress conditions (phase 2). Following this procedure, the cellular protein content dropped to 44.7% of its initial level, while the lipid content rose by up to 320%. Additionally, the astaxanthin concentration increased from 1.1 mg/g<sub>DW</sub> to 4.9 mg/g<sub>DW</sub> during the last osmotic stress phases, aligning with results from published laboratory-scale studies.",Systems Biology,ichromochloris zofingiensisi green alga serves valuable source lipids proteins carotenoids compared wellstudied microalgal carotenoid producers ic zofingiensisi offers several advantages including high biomass lipid carotenoid productivity well less susceptibility contaminations ic zofingiensisi achieve growth rates four times higher ih pluvialisi optimal phototrophic conditions although several studies examined cultivation carotenogenesis different tropic growth modes laboratory scale focused pilotscale systems goal study investigate microalgas physiological adaptation l tubular photobioreactor threephase semicontinuous cultivation strategy particularly focusing changes macromolecular pigment composition initial biomass accumulation phase twophased stress phase applied combining nutrient depletion phase osmotic salt stress conditions phase following procedure cellular protein content dropped initial level lipid content rose additionally astaxanthin concentration increased mggsubdwsub mggsubdwsub last osmotic stress phases aligning results published laboratoryscale studies,Systems Biology

"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Bladder cancer (BLCA), intimately associated with the immune system, represents a substantial global health burden due to its high recurrence rates and limited therapeutic effectiveness. Although immunotherapy shows promise, challenges persist due to the lack of reliable therapeutic targets. This study aims to investigate potential immune-related biomarkers that could influence the tumor microenvironment in BLCA, using proteomic and in silico approaches. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Tissue samples from BLCA patients (n = 27) and controls (n = 27) were collected from Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital. Proteomic analysis was performed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS to reveal the identities of differentially regulated proteins. Protein network analysis and hub protein detection were performed using Cytoscape (v.3.10.3), while functional annotation was carried out using EnrichR. The immunological analysis of hub proteins was performed in Sangerbox platform, and prognostic associations were evaluated through the Kaplan-Meier Plotter tool. <i>Results</i>: LC-MS/MS analysis identified 120 differentially regulated immune-related proteins. STRING analysis, using an immune response dataset (GO:0006955), highlighted the complement cascade as a significantly enriched pathway (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Proteins, namely C4A, CFB, C4B, C8B, CFH, CFI, C5, C4BPA, C3, and C2, that are known to play key roles in the complement system were identified. Immunological analysis with these proteins revealed the phenomena of immune infiltration and immune checkpoint gene associations (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Four hub genes-CFB, C4B, CFI, and C2-demonstrated a significant prognostic value for BLCA (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <i>Conclusions</i>: This study highlights the pivotal role of the complement system in the immune regulation of BLCA. CFI, C4A, and C4B emerged as potential target proteins for BLCA treatment, particularly in immunotherapy, for enhancing survival.

"Obesity has been the subject of research focused on preventive policies among the young population due to epidemiological studies which have shown devastating figures in recent years in terms of the incidence and prevalence of this condition. A number of previously known biomarkers have proven useful in the early diagnosis of complications associated with obesity, while others remain in the study stage. The intestinal microbiota are also relevant in the secondary prevention of obesity complications, another area that has turned into a hot topic of current research. The primary goal of this review is to highlight markers and mechanisms that can enhance specialists' understanding of obesity assessment and its systemic complications. Salivary markers have been proven useful in the evaluation of obesity, with the advantage of being low-cost and easy to sample. Another interesting topic is the role of the renin-angiotensin and the kallikrein-kinin systems in obesity-related systemic complications.

"The review presents arguments emphasizing the importance of using the entropic measure of time (EMT) in the study of irreversible evolving systems. The possibilities of this measure for obtaining the laws of system evolution are shown. It is demonstrated that EMT provides a novel and unified perspective on the principle of maximum entropy production (MEPP), which is established in the physics of irreversible processes, as well as on the laws of growth and evolution proposed in biology. Essentially, for irreversible processes, the proposed approach allows, in a certain sense, to identify concepts such as the duration of existence, MEPP, and natural selection. EMT has been used to generalize prior results, indicating that the intrinsic time of a system is logarithmically dependent on extrinsic (Newtonian) time.",Systems Biology,review presents arguments emphasizing importance using entropic measure time emt study irreversible evolving systems possibilities measure obtaining laws system evolution shown demonstrated emt provides novel unified perspective principle maximum entropy production mepp established physics irreversible processes well laws growth evolution proposed biology essentially irreversible processes proposed approach allows certain sense identify concepts duration existence mepp natural selection emt used generalize prior results indicating intrinsic time system logarithmically dependent extrinsic newtonian time,Systems Biology
"Small, forested catchments are prototypes of terrestrial ecosystems and have been studied in several disciplines of environmental science over several decades. Time series of water and matter fluxes and nutrient concentrations from these systems exhibit a bewildering diversity of spatiotemporal patterns, indicating the intricate nature of processes acting on a large range of time scales. Nonlinear dynamics is an obvious framework to investigate catchment time series. We analyzed selected long-term data from three headwater catchments in the Bramke valley, Harz mountains, Lower Saxony in Germany at common biweekly resolution for the period 1991 to 2023. For every time series, we performed gap filling, detrending, and removal of the annual cycle using singular system analysis (SSA), and then calculated metrics based on ordinal pattern statistics: the permutation entropy, permutation complexity, and Fisher information, as well as their generalized versions (q-entropy and α-entropy). Further, the position of each variable in Tarnopolski diagrams is displayed and compared to reference stochastic processes, like fractional Brownian motion, fractional Gaussian noise, and β noise. Still another way of distinguishing deterministic chaos and structured noise, and quantifying the latter, is provided by the complexity from ordinal pattern positioned slopes (COPPS). We also constructed horizontal visibility graphs and estimated the exponent of the decay of the degree distribution. Taken together, the analyses create a characterization of the dynamics of these systems which can be scrutinized for universality, either across variables or between the three geographically very close catchments.",Systems Biology,small forested catchments prototypes terrestrial ecosystems studied several disciplines environmental science several decades time series water matter fluxes nutrient concentrations systems exhibit bewildering diversity spatiotemporal patterns indicating intricate nature processes acting large range time scales nonlinear dynamics obvious framework investigate catchment time series analyzed selected longterm data three headwater catchments bramke valley harz mountains lower saxony germany common biweekly resolution period every time series performed gap filling detrending removal annual cycle using singular system analysis ssa calculated metrics based ordinal pattern statistics permutation entropy permutation complexity fisher information well generalized versions qentropy entropy position variable tarnopolski diagrams displayed compared reference stochastic processes like fractional brownian motion fractional gaussian noise noise still another way distinguishing deterministic chaos structured noise quantifying latter provided complexity ordinal pattern positioned slopes copps also constructed horizontal visibility graphs estimated exponent decay degree distribution taken together analyses create characterization dynamics systems scrutinized universality either across variables three geographically close catchments,Systems Biology
"The CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as one of the most promising gene-editing technologies in biology. However, off-target effects remain a significant challenge. While recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of models for off-target prediction, these models often fail to fully leverage sequence pair information. Furthermore, as the models' parameter sizes increase, so do their complexities, limiting their practical applicability. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-feature independent encoding method, which encodes the gRNA-DNA sequence pair into three distinct feature matrices to minimize information loss. Additionally, we propose a lightweight hybrid deep learning framework, CRISPR-MFH, that integrates multi-scale separable convolutions and hybrid attention mechanisms for efficient and accurate off-target prediction. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed encoding method effectively captures critical features and that CRISPR-MFH outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters across multiple evaluation metrics.

"<b>Background:</b> RNA alternative splicing represents a pivotal regulatory mechanism of eukaryotic gene expression, wherein splicing factors (SFs) serve as key regulators. Aberrant SF expression drives oncogenic splice variant production, thereby promoting tumorigenesis and malignant progression. However, the biological functions and potential targets of SFs remain largely underexplored. <b>Methods:</b> Through multi-omics analysis, we identified survival-related splicing factors (SFs) in esophageal cancer and elucidated their biological regulatory networks. To further investigate their downstream splicing targets, we combined alternative splicing events resulting from SF knockdown with those specific to esophageal cancer. Finally, these splicing events were validated through full-length RNA sequencing and confirmed in cancer cells and clinical specimens. <b>Result:</b> We identified six SFs that are highly expressed in esophageal cancer and correlate with poor prognosis. Further analysis revealed that these factors are significantly associated with immune infiltration, cancer stemness, tumor heterogeneity, and drug resistance. <i>CRNKL1</i> was identified as a hub SFs. The target genes and pathways regulated by these SFs showed substantial overlap, suggesting their coordinated roles in promoting cancer stemness and metastasis. Specifically, alternative splicing of key markers, such as CD44 and <i>CTTN</i>, was regulated by most of these SFs and correlated with poor prognosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study unveils six survival-related SFs that contribute to the aggressiveness of esophageal cancer and <i>CTTN</i> and <i>CD44</i> alternative splicing may act as common downstream effectors of survival-related SFs.

"Biogeochemical cycles are fundamental to the functioning of plant-soil systems, driving the availability and transfer of essential nutrients (like carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S)) as well as beneficial elements (like silicon (Si)). These interconnected cycles regulate ecosystem productivity, biodiversity, and resilience, forming the basis of critical ecosystem services. This review explores the mechanisms and dynamics of biogeochemical C, N, P, S, and Si cycles, emphasizing their roles in nutrient/element cycling, plant growth, and soil health, especially in agricultural plant-soil systems. The coupling between these cycles, facilitated mainly by microbial communities, highlights the complexity of nutrient/element interactions and corresponding implications for ecosystem functioning and stability. Human activities including industrial agriculture, deforestation, and pollution disrupt the underlying natural processes leading to nutrient/element imbalances, soil degradation, and susceptibility to climate impacts. Technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and real-time soil monitoring offer innovative solutions for studying and managing biogeochemical cycles. These tools enable precise nutrient/element management, identification of ecosystem vulnerabilities, and the development of sustainable practices. Despite significant progress, research gaps remain, particularly in understanding the interlinkages between biogeochemical cycles and their responses to global change. This review underscores the need for integrated approaches that combine interdisciplinary research, technological innovation, and sustainable land-use strategies to mitigate human-induced disruptions and enhance ecosystem resilience.

"Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are key elements of the genetic structure of populations, reflecting inbreeding levels, selection history, and potential associations with phenotypic traits. This study proposes a novel approach to ROH analysis through visualization and classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Genetic data from Large White (n = 568) and Duroc (n = 600) pigs were used to construct ROH maps, where each homozygous segment was classified by length and visualized as a color-coded image. The analysis was conducted in two stages: (1) classification of animals by breed based on ROH maps and (2) identification of the presence or absence of a phenotypic trait (limb defects). Genotyping was performed using the GeneSeek<sup>®</sup> GGP SNP80x1_XT chip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and ROH segments were identified using the software tool PLINK v1.9. To visualize individual maps, we utilized a modified function from the HandyCNV package. The results showed that the CNN model achieved 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in classifying pig breeds based on ROH maps. When analyzing the binary trait (presence or absence of limb defects), the model demonstrated an accuracy of 78.57%. Despite the moderate accuracy in predicting the phenotypic trait, the high negative predictive value (84.62%) indicates the model's reliability in identifying healthy animals. This method can be applied not only in animal breeding research but also in medicine to study the association between ROH and hereditary diseases. Future plans include expanding the method to other types of genetic data and developing mechanisms to improve the interpretability of deep learning models.",Systems Biology,runs homozygosity roh key elements genetic structure populations reflecting inbreeding levels selection history potential associations phenotypic traits study proposes novel approach roh analysis visualization classification using convolutional neural networks cnns genetic data large white n duroc n pigs used construct roh maps homozygous segment classified length visualized colorcoded image analysis conducted two stages classification animals breed based roh maps identification presence absence phenotypic trait limb defects genotyping performed using geneseeksupsup ggp snpxxt chip illumina inc san diego ca usa roh segments identified using software tool plink v visualize individual maps utilized modified function handycnv package results showed cnn model achieved accuracy sensitivity specificity classifying pig breeds based roh maps analyzing binary trait presence absence limb defects model demonstrated accuracy despite moderate accuracy predicting phenotypic trait high negative predictive value indicates models reliability identifying healthy animals method applied animal breeding research also medicine study association roh hereditary diseases future plans include expanding method types genetic data developing mechanisms improve interpretability deep learning models,Systems Biology
"Interactions between honeybees and the environment are often difficult to achieve, particularly when the purpose is to optimize beekeeping production. The present study proposed to monitor the space-time variations of melliferous resources potentially exploited by colonies within a foraging area in Bosnia & Herzegovina, characterized by contrasting landscapes. The combination of methods involving Geographical Information Systems, floristic monitoring, and modelling enabled honey production potential to be calculated for the entire foraging area. In particular, the location of taxa, their abundance, diversity, and phenology enabled us to determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of production potential. <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> and <i>Rubus</i> sp. made a major contribution. This potential was highly contrasted, with distant areas from the apiary more attractive than closer ones, depending on the moment. Specific periods, such as June were particularly conducive to establishing a high potential. Forest and grassland played a major role in the temporal succession, mainly because of the area covered, but moments with lower potential were supported by specific land uses (orchards). Land uses with a small surface area, such as orchards, wasteland, and riparian zones had a high potential per unit area, and improving the production potential within a foraging area could involve increasing these specific surfaces.",Systems Biology,interactions honeybees environment often difficult achieve particularly purpose optimize beekeeping production present study proposed monitor spacetime variations melliferous resources potentially exploited colonies within foraging area bosnia herzegovina characterized contrasting landscapes combination methods involving geographical information systems floristic monitoring modelling enabled honey production potential calculated entire foraging area particular location taxa abundance diversity phenology enabled us determine spatial distribution temporal variation production potential irobinia pseudoacaciai irubusi sp made major contribution potential highly contrasted distant areas apiary attractive closer ones depending moment specific periods june particularly conducive establishing high potential forest grassland played major role temporal succession mainly area covered moments lower potential supported specific land uses orchards land uses small surface area orchards wasteland riparian zones high potential per unit area improving production potential within foraging area could involve increasing specific surfaces,Systems Biology
"Pyrethroid pesticides like deltamethrin and cypermethrin are widely used in aquaculture, yet their food safety implications remain understudied. This research investigated their acute toxicity, tissue-specific bioaccumulation, and elimination patterns in crucian carp (<i>Carassius auratus</i>). Acute toxicity tests determined 96 h LC50 values of 9.68~11.22 ng·mL⁻<sup>1</sup> (deltamethrin) and 3.12~5.01 ng·mL⁻<sup>1</sup> (cypermethrin) with 95% confidence intervals. During 8-day exposures to sublethal concentrations (1/10 and 1/100 of LC50), deltamethrin accumulated predominantly in the liver (peak: 21.98 ng·g⁻<sup>1</sup> at 1.04 ng·mL⁻<sup>1</sup>, standard deviation is 0.064 ng·mL⁻<sup>1</sup>), whereas cypermethrin concentrated in muscle (peak: 9.76 ng·g⁻<sup>1</sup> at 0.40 ng·mL⁻<sup>1</sup>, standard deviation is 0.138 ng·mL⁻<sup>1</sup>). A 7-day elimination phase revealed faster clearance of low-concentration residues, with >50% removal within 24 h in all tissues. Bioconcentration factors were highest in the liver (36.62 for deltamethrin) and muscle (45.17 for cypermethrin). These results highlight tissue-specific accumulation risks and rapid initial elimination, providing critical data to optimize pesticide-dosing protocols, mitigate ecotoxicological threats, and enhance food safety in aquaculture systems.",Systems Biology,pyrethroid pesticides like deltamethrin cypermethrin widely used aquaculture yet food safety implications remain understudied research investigated acute toxicity tissuespecific bioaccumulation elimination patterns crucian carp icarassius auratusi acute toxicity tests determined h lc values ngmlsupsup deltamethrin ngmlsupsup cypermethrin confidence intervals day exposures sublethal concentrations lc deltamethrin accumulated predominantly liver peak nggsupsup ngmlsupsup standard deviation ngmlsupsup whereas cypermethrin concentrated muscle peak nggsupsup ngmlsupsup standard deviation ngmlsupsup day elimination phase revealed faster clearance lowconcentration residues removal within h tissues bioconcentration factors highest liver deltamethrin muscle cypermethrin results highlight tissuespecific accumulation risks rapid initial elimination providing critical data optimize pesticidedosing protocols mitigate ecotoxicological threats enhance food safety aquaculture systems,Systems Biology

"This study elucidates the structural determinants and optogenetic potential of Archaerhodopsin <i>He</i>AR, a proton pump from <i>Halorubrum</i> sp. Ejinoor isolated from Inner Mongolian salt lakes. Through heterologous expression in <i>E. coli</i> BL21 (DE3) and integrative biophysical analyses, we demonstrate that <i>He</i>AR adopts a stable trimeric architecture (129 kDa) with detergent-binding characteristics mirroring bacteriorhodopsin (BR); however, it exhibits a 10 nm bathochromic spectral shift (λmax = 550 nm) and elevated proton affinity (Asp-95 pKa = 3.5 vs. BR Asp-85 pKa = 2.6), indicative of evolutionary optimization in its retinal-binding electrostatic microenvironment. Kinetic profiling reveals <i>He</i>AR's prolonged photocycle (100 ms vs. BR's 11 ms), marked by rapid M-state decay (3.3 ms) and extended dark-adaptation half-life (160 min), a bistable behavior attributed to enhanced hydrogen bond persistence (80%) and reduced conformational entropy (RMSD = 2.0 Å). Functional assays confirm light-driven proton extrusion (0.1 ng H⁺/mg·s) with DCCD-amplified flux (0.3 ng H⁺/mg·s) and ATP synthesis (0.3 nmol/mg·s), underscoring its synergy with H⁺-ATPase. Phylogenetic and structural analyses reveal 95% homology with <i>Halorubrum</i> AR4 and conservation of 11 proton-wire residues, despite divergent Trp/Tyr/Ser networks that redefine chromophore stabilization. AlphaFold-predicted models (TM-score > 0.92) and molecular docking identify superior retinoid-binding affinity (ΔG = -12.27 kcal/mol), while spectral specificity (550-560 nm) and acid-stable photoresponse highlight its adaptability for low-irradiance neuromodulation. These findings position <i>He</i>AR as a precision optogenetic tool, circumventing spectral overlap with excitatory opsins and enabling sustained hyperpolarization with minimized phototoxicity.

"The Constrained Disorder Principle (CDP) offers a new framework for understanding how biological systems use and manage noise to maintain optimal functionality. This review explores the relationship between noise and biological systems at various scales, including genetic, cellular, and organ levels, and its implications for system malfunctions. According to the CDP, all systems require an optimal range of noise to function appropriately, and disease states can arise when these noise levels are disrupted. This review presents evidence supporting this principle across different biological contexts, such as genetic variability, cellular behavior, brain functions, human behavior, aging, evolution, and drug administration. For accurate clinical assessments, it is essential to distinguish between technical variability and intrinsic biological variability. When noise is adequately constrained, it serves as a fundamental mechanism for system adaptation and optimal functioning rather than simply a source of disruption. These findings have important implications for developing more effective therapeutic strategies and understanding biological systems' dynamics. CDP-based second-generation artificial intelligence systems can help regulate noise levels to address malfunctions. These systems have improved clinical outcomes in various conditions by incorporating controlled randomness. Understanding these patterns of variability has significant implications for diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and the development of more effective therapeutic strategies across various medical conditions.",Systems Biology,constrained disorder principle cdp offers new framework understanding biological systems use manage noise maintain optimal functionality review explores relationship noise biological systems various scales including genetic cellular organ levels implications system malfunctions according cdp systems require optimal range noise function appropriately disease states arise noise levels disrupted review presents evidence supporting principle across different biological contexts genetic variability cellular behavior brain functions human behavior aging evolution drug administration accurate clinical assessments essential distinguish technical variability intrinsic biological variability noise adequately constrained serves fundamental mechanism system adaptation optimal functioning rather simply source disruption findings important implications developing effective therapeutic strategies understanding biological systems dynamics cdpbased secondgeneration artificial intelligence systems help regulate noise levels address malfunctions systems improved clinical outcomes various conditions incorporating controlled randomness understanding patterns variability significant implications diagnosis treatment monitoring development effective therapeutic strategies across various medical conditions,Systems Biology
"Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products (PPCPs), such as carbamazepine, enter the food chain through wastewater irrigation, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. However, research on the translocation and subcellular distribution of carbamazepine in vegetables is limited. Herein, we used <sup>14</sup>C-labeled carbamazepine as a tracer to investigate its removal, accumulation, and subcellular compartmentalization in hydroponic vegetable systems. Results showed carbamazepine accumulated in Chinese flowering cabbage and water spinach with removal efficiencies of 93.0-93.2%. The compound was absorbed by roots and translocated to aboveground tissues, particularly in bottom leaves, reaching 90.3 μmol/kg after 768 h, as confirmed by autoradiography. Subcellular analysis indicated that carbamazepine is predominantly distributed in root organelles and in the soluble fraction of leaves and stems. A strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.800) was observed between root enrichment coefficients and log <i>K</i><sub>OW</sub> for caffeine, carbamazepine, and kresoxim-methyl. Higher lipid content in water spinach roots (2.07%) significantly enhanced upward transport, underscoring lipid content's role in translocation.

"The constrained disorder principle (CDP) defines complex biological systems based on inherent variability. Allostasis refers to the physiological processes that help maintain stability in response to changing environmental demands. Allostatic load describes the cumulative wear and tear on the body resulting from prolonged exposure to stress, and it has been suggested to mediate the relationship between stress and disease. This study presents the concepts of CDP and allostasis while discussing their similarities and differences.

"Endosymbiosis can be considered a regressive or degenerative evolutionary process characterized at the genomic level by genome erosion and degeneration due to high mutational pressure toward AT (adenine and thymine) bases. The genomic and biological complexity of endosymbionts must be lower than that of the free-living bacteria from which they evolved. In the present work, we contrasted whether two proposed metrics for measuring genomic complexity in both types of bacteria, <i>GS</i> and <i>BB</i>, reflect their complexity, expecting higher values in free-living bacteria than in endosymbionts. On the other hand, we endeavored to delve into the factors that contribute to the reduction in metric values in endosymbionts, as well as their eventual relationship with six genomic parameters associated with functionality.

"<i>Enterospora epinepheli</i> poses a severe threat to grouper aquaculture due to the absence of effective prevention and treatment strategies. To address this challenge, we developed and validated two isothermal diagnostic tools, the real-time enzymatic recombinase amplification (RT-ERA) assay and the enzymatic recombinase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick (ERA-LFD) assay, targeting the 18S rDNA gene of the parasite. These assays operate under isothermal conditions at ≤40 °C and offer rapid detection, with RT-ERA yielding results in 14~20 min and ERA-LFD in approximately 10 min. The RT-ERA assay demonstrated a strong linear relationship between plasmid copy numbers and cycle threshold (Ct) values (y = -2.1226x + 19.562, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9915), enabling accurate quantification. Both methods displayed a detection limit of 2 × 10<sup>0</sup> copies/μL and no cross-reactivity with other aquaculture pathogens. Validation using grouper tissue and water samples from Hainan, China, demonstrated 100% concordance rates with basic ERA and outperformed compared to conventional PCR.

"Harvest weight uniformity is a critical economic trait in the production of Pacific white shrimp (<i>Penaeus vannamei</i>). Social interactions among individuals can significantly influence both uniformity and productivity in aquaculture. To improve harvest weight uniformity through selective breeding, it is essential to accurately partition the genetic component of social effects, known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE), from purely environmental factors. Since IGEs cannot be estimated when all individuals are kept in a single group, a specialized experimental design, such as the grouping design with three families per group (3FAM), is required. With this experimental design, the shrimp population is divided into multiple groups (cages), each containing three families. Individuals from each family are then evenly subdivided and placed in three cages, thereby enabling the estimation of both direct and social genetic effects. Additionally, integrating genomic information instead of relying solely on pedigree data improves the accuracy of genetic relatedness among individuals, leading to more precise genetic evaluation. This study employed a 3FAM experimental design involving 40 families (36 individuals per family) to estimate the contribution of direct and indirect genetic effects on harvest weight uniformity. The genotypes of all tested individuals obtained using the 55K SNP panel were incorporated into a hierarchical generalized linear model to predict direct genetic effects and indirect genetic effects (IGE) separately. The results revealed that the heritability of harvest weight uniformity was low (0.005 to 0.017). However, the genetic coefficient of variation (0.340 to 0.528) indicates that using the residual variance in harvest weight as a selection criterion for improving uniformity is feasible. Incorporating IGE into the model increased heritability estimates for uniformity by 150% to 240% and genetic coefficient of variation for uniformity by 32.11% to 55.29%, compared to the model without IGE. Moreover, the genetic correlation between harvest weight and its uniformity shifted from a strongly negative value (-0.862 to -0.683) to a weakly positive value (0.203 to 0.117), suggesting an improvement in the genetic relationship between the traits and better separation of genetic and environmental effects. The inclusion of genomic data enhanced the prediction ability of single-step best linear unbiased prediction for both harvest weight and uniformity by 6.35% and 10.53%, respectively, compared to the pedigree-based best linear unbiased prediction. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating IGE and utilizing genomic selection methods to enhance selection accuracy for obtaining harvest weight uniformity. This approach provides a theoretical foundation for guiding uniformity improvements in shrimp breeding programs and offers potential applications in other food production systems.",Systems Biology,harvest weight uniformity critical economic trait production pacific white shrimp ipenaeus vannameii social interactions among individuals significantly influence uniformity productivity aquaculture improve harvest weight uniformity selective breeding essential accurately partition genetic component social effects known indirect genetic effect ige purely environmental factors since iges cannot estimated individuals kept single group specialized experimental design grouping design three families per group fam required experimental design shrimp population divided multiple groups cages containing three families individuals family evenly subdivided placed three cages thereby enabling estimation direct social genetic effects additionally integrating genomic information instead relying solely pedigree data improves accuracy genetic relatedness among individuals leading precise genetic evaluation study employed fam experimental design involving families individuals per family estimate contribution direct indirect genetic effects harvest weight uniformity genotypes tested individuals obtained using k snp panel incorporated hierarchical generalized linear model predict direct genetic effects indirect genetic effects ige separately results revealed heritability harvest weight uniformity low however genetic coefficient variation indicates using residual variance harvest weight selection criterion improving uniformity feasible incorporating ige model increased heritability estimates uniformity genetic coefficient variation uniformity compared model without ige moreover genetic correlation harvest weight uniformity shifted strongly negative value weakly positive value suggesting improvement genetic relationship traits better separation genetic environmental effects inclusion genomic data enhanced prediction ability singlestep best linear unbiased prediction harvest weight uniformity respectively compared pedigreebased best linear unbiased prediction findings highlight importance incorporating ige utilizing genomic selection methods enhance selection accuracy obtaining harvest weight uniformity approach provides theoretical foundation guiding uniformity improvements shrimp breeding programs offers potential applications food production systems,Systems Biology
"The widespread application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has resulted in environmental pollution. With the growing emphasis on ecological agriculture in traditional Chinese medicine, microbial fertilizers are increasingly recognized for their potential. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of inoculating nitrogen-fixing bacteria on the soil (yellow loam, river sand, and organic fertilizer in a 2:1:1 ratio) of <i>Fritillaria taipaiensis</i>, with a focus on the leaf changes in terms of physiological parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, and corresponding gene expression levels. The experiment involved three nitrogen-fixing bacteria, namely <i>Rahnella aquatilis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</i>, and <i>Paenibacillus stellifer</i>, with a total of eight treatment groups. The objective was to assess how these bacterial treatments influenced physiological parameters, photosynthetic characteristics, pigment content, and both antioxidant enzyme activities and gene expression in the leaves of <i>F. taipaiensis</i>. The experimental results demonstrated statistically significant reductions (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in malondialdehyde (MDA) content and stomatal limitation value (LS) in <i>F. taipaiensis</i> leaves under treatment conditions relative to the control group (CK). The most substantial decreases were observed dual-inoculation with <i>R. aquatilis</i> and <i>P. stellifer</i> (N5), showing reductions of 38.24% and 20.94% in MDA and LS compared to CK values. Additionally, leaf area, leaf thickness, stem thickness, plant height, photosynthetic parameters, pigment content, soluble sugars, soluble proteins, proline levels, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) exhibited varying degrees of increase. Compared to the CK group, the SOD, POD, and CAT activities of the N5 group increased by 141.06%, 160.59%, and 106.23%, respectively. The relative gene expression patterns of SOD, POD, and CAT corresponded with the trends observed in their respective antioxidant enzyme activities. Pearson correlation analysis further demonstrated that leaf area and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) were significantly correlated with respect to SOD, POD, and CAT activities, as well as their corresponding gene expression levels. In conclusion, inoculation with nitrogen-fixing bacteria improved the growth and stress tolerance of <i>F. taipaiensis</i>, with the combined application of <i>Rahnella aquatilis</i> and <i>Pseudomonas stellifer</i> yielding the most effective results. This study establishes that different rhizosphere nitrogen-fixing bacteria, either individually or in combination, influence the photosynthetic characteristics, physiological and biochemical parameters, and protective enzyme systems of <i>F. taipaiensis</i>.

"Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with emotional distress, depression, and anxiety. Defense mechanisms and mentalized affectivity play key roles in affective regulation; however, their roles in individuals with MI remain underexplored. This study examined the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms, defensive functioning, and mentalized affectivity in MI patients. Sixty-seven patients with MI and 80 healthy controls completed the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures-Depression and Anxiety-Adult, the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scales-Self-Report-30, and the Brief-Mentalized Affectivity Scale. Multivariate analyses were used to compare the MI and healthy groups, while correlations and mediation models were used to evaluate associations between variables within the MI group. Compared to controls, patients with MI exhibited more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, maladaptive defenses, and lower levels of mentalized affectivity. Within the MI group, the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was associated with immature defensive functioning and poorer abilities to regulate affects. Notably, the relationship between worse defensive functioning and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms was mediated by the capacity to process emotions. The mediating role of this specific dimension of mentalized affectivity emphasizes the potential of affect regulation as a target for tailored psychosocial interventions aimed at improving clinical outcomes.",Systems Biology,myocardial infarction mi associated emotional distress depression anxiety defense mechanisms mentalized affectivity play key roles affective regulation however roles individuals mi remain underexplored study examined relationship depressive anxiety symptoms defensive functioning mentalized affectivity mi patients sixtyseven patients mi healthy controls completed dsm selfrated level crosscutting symptom measuresdepression anxietyadult defense mechanisms rating scalesselfreport briefmentalized affectivity scale multivariate analyses used compare mi healthy groups correlations mediation models used evaluate associations variables within mi group compared controls patients mi exhibited severe depressive anxiety symptoms maladaptive defenses lower levels mentalized affectivity within mi group severity depressive anxiety symptoms associated immature defensive functioning poorer abilities regulate affects notably relationship worse defensive functioning severe depressive anxiety symptoms mediated capacity process emotions mediating role specific dimension mentalized affectivity emphasizes potential affect regulation target tailored psychosocial interventions aimed improving clinical outcomes,Systems Biology
"Coccidiosis caused by <i>Eimeria</i> spp. is a parasitic disease with high morbidity that affects various animal species, including rabbits. In rabbits, eleven <i>Eimeria</i> species have been primarily identified through microscopic examination of oocysts; however, this technique has certain limitations that make it challenging to differentiate between <i>Eimeria</i> species. The main objective of this study was to morphologically identify <i>Eimeria</i> species infecting rabbits in Romania, as well as to confirm these identifications using molecular biology techniques, specifically through the ITS-1 rRNA gene. A total of 236 samples were collected from different regions of Romania, of which 77.56% (183/236) tested positive for at least one <i>Eimeria</i> species. The samples were collected from rabbits raised in individual household settings, under various management systems-both in individual cages and in common ground-based enclosures. The areas of origin were chosen randomly, without applying restrictive criteria, specifically to ensure broad representativeness of the farming conditions encountered in practice, regardless of the production system or geographic specificity. The microscopic examination of morphological characteristics identified ten <i>Eimeria</i> species, whereas PCR results confirmed the presence of four species. It was not always possible to identify all the species present in a given sample, likely due to the predominant parasitic load and the DNA quantity of each species.

"Fish are vital for material cycling and energy flow in aquatic ecosystems. The genus <i>Triplophysa</i>, with over 100 known species, is significant in the Central Asian highlands' freshwater ecosystems. <i>T. strauchii</i> and <i>T. tenuis</i>, as representatives, occupy distinct ecological niches and face challenges from climate change and human activities. There is a lack of research on <i>Triplophysa</i> fishes' digestive systems, especially comparative studies, so this research aims to fill this gap. In September 2024, 40 samples of <i>T. strauchii</i> were collected from Sayram Lake and 40 samples of <i>T. tenuis</i> were collected from the Muzat River in Xinjiang. After acclimation, morphological observations (measuring fish and digestive tract parameters) and histological analyses (paraffin sectioning, HE staining, and microscopy) were carried out. The data were sorted in Excel and analyzed with an independent samples <i>t</i>-test in SPSS 27.0. Morphologically, <i>T. strauchii</i> has an obtuse snout, terminal mouth, specific upper lip papillae, and an S-shaped intestine about (1.45 ± 0.11) times its body length, while <i>T. tenuis</i> has an arc-shaped subterminal mouth, fringed papillae, and a spiral-shaped intestine around (0.82 ± 0.09) times its body length. Both possess a digestive tract, glands, and a hepatopancreas attached to the mesentery. Histologically, a large number of club cells were found in the oropharyngeal cavities of both species; their secretions have an adhesive effect on food, aiding food selection. Their digestive systems vary in structure and cell composition: the oropharyngeal cavity has three layers; the esophagus has four layers with more goblet cells in <i>T. strauchii</i>; the stomach has three regions without goblet cells and a thicker muscular layer in <i>T. strauchii</i>; the intestinal wall has four layers with different villi and goblet cell distributions; the hepatopancreas has lobules; and <i>T. strauchii</i> has a typical portal area. In conclusion, this study systematically compared the gastrointestinal systems of <i>T. strauchii</i> and <i>T. tenuis</i> for the first time, revealing significant structural differences related to their niches and feeding patterns as adaptations to specific environments.

"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) technologies have attracted substantial interest due to their advantages over traditional biological nitrogen removal processes, including high efficiency and low energy demand. Currently, multiple side-stream applications of the anammox coupling process have been developed, including one-stage, two-stage, and three-stage systems such as completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite, denitrifying ammonium oxidation, simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal, partial denitrification-anammox, and partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation. The one-stage system includes completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite, oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification, aerobic de-ammonification, single-stage nitrogen removal using anammox, and partial nitritation. Two-stage systems, such as the single reactor system for high-activity ammonium removal over nitrite, integrated fixed-film activated sludge, and simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal, have also been developed. Three-stage systems comprise partial nitrification anammox, partial denitrification anammox, simultaneous ammonium oxidation denitrification, and partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation. The performance of these systems is highly dependent on interactions between functional microbial communities, physiochemical parameters, and environmental factors. Mainstream applications are not well developed and require further research and development. Mainstream applications demand a high carbon/nitrogen ratio to maintain levels of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, high concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in wastewater, and retention of anammox bacteria biomass. To summarize various aspects of the anammox processes, this review provides information regarding the microbial diversity of different genera of anammox bacteria and the engineering aspects of various side streams and mainstream anammox processes for wastewater treatment.

"Older individuals are at risk of falling. Assistive devices like rollators help to reduce that risk, especially by compensating for decreased leg muscle strength and balance problems. Paradoxically, rollators have been found to be a fall risk as well as being difficult to use. To investigate the causes, this study examines how different levels of rollator support (no assistance, light touch, and full support) and balance demands (standard lab floor, balance pads) affect movement coordination during standing up and sitting down movements. Twenty young participants stood up and sat down while full-body kinematics and muscle activity (30 channels) were recorded. Participants stood up and sat down using different movement strategies (e.g., forward leaning, hybrid, and vertical rise standing up movement strategies). For each movement strategy, spatial and temporal muscle synergies were extracted from the muscle activity patterns. Temporal muscle synergies provided a more compact, low-dimensional representation than spatial muscle synergies, so they were subsequently clustered with k-means++. The activation duration of the temporal muscle synergies was assessed with full-width at half-maximum at the main peak. Multivariate linear mixed models were used to investigate if the muscle weightings associated with the temporal muscle synergies differed across the support conditions. The timings of the temporal muscle synergy activations, but not the shape, differed across the movement strategies for both types of movement. Across all tasks, temporal muscle synergies showed a narrower width of activation around the time of seat-off and seat-on than at the movement start and end. No support-specific temporal muscle synergies were found, but lower limb muscle weightings decreased while upper-limb muscle weightings increased with increased support. The narrow shape of the temporal synergy activation profiles suggests that the central nervous system controls the movements tightly, especially around seat-off and seat-on and in challenging conditions with increased balance demands. Furthermore, rollator support increases the weightings of upper body and decreases the weightings of lower limb muscles, especially around seat-off and seat-on. Future studies may further investigate how the loss of tight movement control may cause falls in older individuals.",Systems Biology,older individuals risk falling assistive devices like rollators help reduce risk especially compensating decreased leg muscle strength balance problems paradoxically rollators found fall risk well difficult use investigate causes study examines different levels rollator support assistance light touch full support balance demands standard lab floor balance pads affect movement coordination standing sitting movements twenty young participants stood sat fullbody kinematics muscle activity channels recorded participants stood sat using different movement strategies eg forward leaning hybrid vertical rise standing movement strategies movement strategy spatial temporal muscle synergies extracted muscle activity patterns temporal muscle synergies provided compact lowdimensional representation spatial muscle synergies subsequently clustered kmeans activation duration temporal muscle synergies assessed fullwidth halfmaximum main peak multivariate linear mixed models used investigate muscle weightings associated temporal muscle synergies differed across support conditions timings temporal muscle synergy activations shape differed across movement strategies types movement across tasks temporal muscle synergies showed narrower width activation around time seatoff seaton movement start end supportspecific temporal muscle synergies found lower limb muscle weightings decreased upperlimb muscle weightings increased increased support narrow shape temporal synergy activation profiles suggests central nervous system controls movements tightly especially around seatoff seaton challenging conditions increased balance demands furthermore rollator support increases weightings upper body decreases weightings lower limb muscles especially around seatoff seaton future studies may investigate loss tight movement control may cause falls older individuals,Systems Biology

Integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq analyses were used to characterize ESCC. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering was performed to stratify the ESCC patients into different subtypes and the clinical and pathological features of the ESCC subtypes were compared. Cox regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were used to select key genes and construct a risk model for ESCC. The associations of the key genes with anti-cancer drug sensitivities in ESCC cell lines were investigated. RT-qRCR experiments, proteomics analysis, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) experiments were used to validate the results. Furthermore, one identified gene was selected to investigate its correlation with EGFR expression and the gene effect scores of various potential gene targets across pan-cancer. The study identified the dysregulated distributions of epithelial cells and fibroblasts as characteristic of ESCC. ESCC patients could be classified into four distinct subtypes with unique cell type features and prognoses. With the gene makers of the cell type features, a four-gene prognostic signature for ESCC was constructed. The CCND1-PKP1-JUP-ANKRD12 model could effectively discriminate the survival status of ESCC patients, independent of various pathological and clinical features. The risk score for the samples was correlated with the expression levels of immunoregulatory genes. The prognostic effects of CCND1, PKP1, and JUP were confirmed at the protein level. The phosphorylation levels of PKP1, JUP, and ANKRD12 were found to be dysregulated in ESCC tumors. Their expression dysregulation and heterogeneity were demonstrated in ESCC cell lines. All four genes were significantly correlated with at least one of the anti-cancer drug sensitivities in ESCC cell lines. PKP1 expression was significantly correlated with EGFR expression and gene effect scores in multiple cancers. We conclude that the CCND1-PKP1-JUP-ANKRD12 signature may serve as a novel indicator for ESCC prognosis and diagnosis. PKP1 expression might provide new clues for gene therapy efficacy in multiple cancers.",Systems Biology,esophageal squamous cell carcinoma escc one common malignancies characterized high heterogeneity poor outcomes effective classification patient stratification identifying reliable markers prognosis prediction treatment choice crucial integration singlecell rnasequencing rnaseq bulk rnaseq analyses used characterize escc nonnegative matrix factorization nmf clustering performed stratify escc patients different subtypes clinical pathological features escc subtypes compared cox regression analysis lasso regression analysis used select key genes construct risk model escc associations key genes anticancer drug sensitivities escc cell lines investigated rtqrcr experiments proteomics analysis multiplex immunohistochemistry mihc experiments used validate results furthermore one identified gene selected investigate correlation egfr expression gene effect scores various potential gene targets across pancancer study identified dysregulated distributions epithelial cells fibroblasts characteristic escc escc patients could classified four distinct subtypes unique cell type features prognoses gene makers cell type features fourgene prognostic signature escc constructed ccndpkpjupankrd model could effectively discriminate survival status escc patients independent various pathological clinical features risk score samples correlated expression levels immunoregulatory genes prognostic effects ccnd pkp jup confirmed protein level phosphorylation levels pkp jup ankrd found dysregulated escc tumors expression dysregulation heterogeneity demonstrated escc cell lines four genes significantly correlated least one anticancer drug sensitivities escc cell lines pkp expression significantly correlated egfr expression gene effect scores multiple cancers conclude ccndpkpjupankrd signature may serve novel indicator escc prognosis diagnosis pkp expression might provide new clues gene therapy efficacy multiple cancers,Systems Biology
"This study aimed to classify dysplastic and healthy oral epithelial histopathological images, according to WHO and binary grading systems, using the Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning algorithm-a state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach and compare it with established Convolutional Neural Network models (VGG16 and ConvNet). A total of 218 histopathological slide images were collected from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology at Tehran University of Medical Sciences archive and combined with two online databases. Two oral pathologists independently labeled the images based on the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) grading system (mild, moderate and severe), the binary grading system (low risk and high risk), including an additional normal tissue class. After preprocessing, the images were fed to the ViT, VGG16 and ConvNet models. Image preprocessing yielded 2,545 low-risk, 2,054 high-risk, 726 mild, 831 moderate, 449 severe, and 937 normal tissue patches. The proposed ViT model outperformed both CNNs with the accuracy of 94% (VGG16:86% and ConvNet: 88%) in 3-class scenario and 97% (VGG16:79% and ConvNet: 88%) in 4-class scenario.

"This work aimed to study the impact of exogenously applied selenium nanoparticle (Se NP) on physiological and biochemical attributes of canola to improve the drought tolerance. Drought stress was imposed by poly ethylene glycol at different concentrations (0, 10 and 15% (W/V)) with or without Se NP (2 and 5 mg/L). Se NP increased plant growth in a dose-dependent manner during drought stress. Se NP boosted chlorophyll precursors such as protoporphyrin, magnesium protoporphyrin, thereby inducing chlorophyll biosynthesis. Enzymes of Krebs cycle, namely aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase, up-regulated by Se NP in canola plants subjected to drought stress. Se NP aided to osmotic regulation and osmotic protection by accumulating osmotic regulatory substances (proline, soluble sugar and protein). Treatment with Se NP reinforced antioxidant defense mechanisms by inducing superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, total phenol and tocopherol, thereby reducing hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde as oxidative stress markers. Thus, Se NP facilitated free radicals scavenging in stressed plants. Generally, Se NP acts as activator for drought stress-related resistance responses and causes the improvement of canola tolerance under drought conditions.",Systems Biology,work aimed study impact exogenously applied selenium nanoparticle se np physiological biochemical attributes canola improve drought tolerance drought stress imposed poly ethylene glycol different concentrations wv without se np mgl se np increased plant growth dosedependent manner drought stress se np boosted chlorophyll precursors protoporphyrin magnesium protoporphyrin thereby inducing chlorophyll biosynthesis enzymes krebs cycle namely aconitase succinate dehydrogenase upregulated se np canola plants subjected drought stress se np aided osmotic regulation osmotic protection accumulating osmotic regulatory substances proline soluble sugar protein treatment se np reinforced antioxidant defense mechanisms inducing superoxide dismutase catalase peroxidase total phenol tocopherol thereby reducing hydrogen peroxide malondialdehyde oxidative stress markers thus se np facilitated free radicals scavenging stressed plants generally se np acts activator drought stressrelated resistance responses causes improvement canola tolerance drought conditions,Systems Biology
"Plants must continuously adapt to environmental fluctuations, which significantly influence their photosynthetic performance and overall metabolism. The sucrose cycling system within plant cells plays a critical regulatory role during stress conditions. This study employed a systems biology approach to analyze system stabilities mathematically under various regulatory conditions impacting sucrose cycling dynamics. We investigated the effects of mutations within this cycle, specifically HEXOKINASE1 (Arabidopsis thaliana gin2-1), alongside high-light exposure. Finally, we confirmed the modeling output in vitro by enzyme assays. The implementation of experimental subcellular metabolite data into a Structural Kinetic Model (SKM) enabled exploration of regulatory responses and system stabilities within a three-compartment model. Within system instabilities, gin2-1 was more instable than its wild type. The gin2-1 mutation particularly was destabilized when fructokinase function was impaired by phosphorylated sugars. Additionally, we confirmed that phosphorylated sugars serve as stronger activators of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) than glucose. Interestingly, models with fructose SPS activation exhibited a similar stability pattern. Consequently, we proposed and confirmed in silico a triple activation of SPS by highly activating phosphorylated sugars and lower activating non-phosphorylated hexoses. Additionally, we biochemically confirmed the previously unknown, but now predicted, activation of SPS by fructose in vitro. In summary, our study highlights the essential role of sucrose cycling in plant cells under stress conditions. The in silico findings reveal that phosphorylated sugars are stronger activators of SPS than glucose and introduce a previously unknown activation mechanism by fructose. These potential activation capacities were confirmed in vitro through SPS enzyme activity assays, underscoring the efficiency of our systems biology approach. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into carbohydrate metabolism regulation and paves the way for future investigations to deepen our understanding of the complexities involved in sucrose cycling and biosynthesis in plants.",Systems Biology,plants must continuously adapt environmental fluctuations significantly influence photosynthetic performance overall metabolism sucrose cycling system within plant cells plays critical regulatory role stress conditions study employed systems biology approach analyze system stabilities mathematically various regulatory conditions impacting sucrose cycling dynamics investigated effects mutations within cycle specifically hexokinase arabidopsis thaliana gin alongside highlight exposure finally confirmed modeling output vitro enzyme assays implementation experimental subcellular metabolite data structural kinetic model skm enabled exploration regulatory responses system stabilities within threecompartment model within system instabilities gin instable wild type gin mutation particularly destabilized fructokinase function impaired phosphorylated sugars additionally confirmed phosphorylated sugars serve stronger activators sucrosephosphate synthase sps glucose interestingly models fructose sps activation exhibited similar stability pattern consequently proposed confirmed silico triple activation sps highly activating phosphorylated sugars lower activating nonphosphorylated hexoses additionally biochemically confirmed previously unknown predicted activation sps fructose vitro summary study highlights essential role sucrose cycling plant cells stress conditions silico findings reveal phosphorylated sugars stronger activators sps glucose introduce previously unknown activation mechanism fructose potential activation capacities confirmed vitro sps enzyme activity assays underscoring efficiency systems biology approach overall research provides valuable insights carbohydrate metabolism regulation paves way future investigations deepen understanding complexities involved sucrose cycling biosynthesis plants,Systems Biology
"Plasma-activated water (PAW) is a recently developed cutting-edge technology that is increasingly gaining interest for its applications in medicine, food industry and agriculture. In plant biology, PAW has been shown to enhance seed germination, plant growth, and plant resilience against biotic and abiotic stresses. Despite increasing knowledge of the beneficial effects exerted by PAW on plants, little information is currently available about how this emerging technology may affect mutualistic plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere. In this work we investigated the impact of irrigation with PAW, generated by a plasma torch, on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Roots of the model legume Lotus japonicus expressing the bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin responded to treatment with PAW 5' (obtained by 5 min water exposure to plasma) with the immediate induction of cytosolic and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signalling is one of the earliest cellular responses to PAW. The long-lasting elevations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were not found to alter cell viability. Quantitative analyses of AM fungal accommodation in the host plant roots along with phosphate accumulation in leaves, as well as chemical analysis of N, C, S in shoots, showed that treatments with PAW play a modulatory role on plant AM symbiotic performance, in a manner dependent on the time interval of water exposure to the plasma and on the duration of plant treatment with PAW. In particular, irrigation with PAW 5' increased fungal colonization after 4 weeks, leading to a significant increase in leaf phosphate content after 7 weeks. Our findings reveal that PAW enhances AM symbiosis by facilitating early fungal accommodation in roots and subsequently increasing phosphate content in leaves at later stages. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of PAW on the plant microbiome may drive research towards a fine-tuning of this novel green technology to maximize its beneficial effects in the context of a more sustainable agriculture.",Systems Biology,plasmaactivated water paw recently developed cuttingedge technology increasingly gaining interest applications medicine food industry agriculture plant biology paw shown enhance seed germination plant growth plant resilience biotic abiotic stresses despite increasing knowledge beneficial effects exerted paw plants little information currently available emerging technology may affect mutualistic plantmicrobe interactions rhizosphere work investigated impact irrigation paw generated plasma torch arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis roots model legume lotus japonicus expressing bioluminescent casupsup reporter aequorin responded treatment paw obtained min water exposure plasma immediate induction cytosolic nuclear casupsup signals indicating casupsupmediated signalling one earliest cellular responses paw longlasting elevations intracellular casupsup levels found alter cell viability quantitative analyses fungal accommodation host plant roots along phosphate accumulation leaves well chemical analysis n c shoots showed treatments paw play modulatory role plant symbiotic performance manner dependent time interval water exposure plasma duration plant treatment paw particular irrigation paw increased fungal colonization weeks leading significant increase leaf phosphate content weeks findings reveal paw enhances symbiosis facilitating early fungal accommodation roots subsequently increasing phosphate content leaves later stages better understanding mechanisms underlying effects paw plant microbiome may drive research towards finetuning novel green technology maximize beneficial effects context sustainable agriculture,Systems Biology
"Depression, a prevalent psychiatric disorder, exerts severe and debilitating impacts on an individual's mental and physical well-being, and it is considered a chronic mental illness. Chronic stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus thermophilus are psychobiotic bacteria and synthesize some neurotransmitters that play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of Bactolac (Lactobacillus plantarum NBIMCC 8767  + Streptococcus thermophilus NBIMCC 8258) on chronic stress-induced depression in rats. Behavioral tests, including the sucrose preference test, elevated plus maze test, forced swim test, and three-chamber sociability test, were employed to assess depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. The expression level of the 5-HT1A, DRD1, ADRA-2A, GABA-A α1, CNR1, NR3C2, NOD1, NLRP3 and MC4R; BDNF levels, glial activity and intestinal permeability were determined in chronic stress-induced depression in rats. In conclusions, chronic stress decreased the expression levels of 5-HT1A, DRD1, ADRA-2A, GABA-A α1, CNR1, NR3C2, NOD1 and BDNF level; increased the expression levels of NLRP3 and MC4R, caused neurodegeneration and glial activity, ultimately led to depressive effects. Bactolac was effective in reducing depressive-like behaviors according to the results of behavioral tests. Bactolac treatment provided high neuronal survival rate increasing BDNF level, prevented the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by reducing the expression levels of NLRP3 and MC4R, therefore, prevented the excessive activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and accordingly, reduced neurodegeneration and glial cell activation in depressed rats. We can suggest that Bactolac supplementation may be beneficial in coping with stress, alleviate the effects of chronic stress and help to protect mental health.",Systems Biology,depression prevalent psychiatric disorder exerts severe debilitating impacts individuals mental physical wellbeing considered chronic mental illness chronic stress plays important role pathophysiology depression lactobacillus plantarum streptococcus thermophilus psychobiotic bacteria synthesize neurotransmitters play role pathogenesis depression study aimed investigate therapeutic effects bactolac lactobacillus plantarum nbimcc streptococcus thermophilus nbimcc chronic stressinduced depression rats behavioral tests including sucrose preference test elevated plus maze test forced swim test threechamber sociability test employed assess depressive anxietylike behaviors expression level hta drd adraa gabaa cnr nrc nod nlrp mcr bdnf levels glial activity intestinal permeability determined chronic stressinduced depression rats conclusions chronic stress decreased expression levels hta drd adraa gabaa cnr nrc nod bdnf level increased expression levels nlrp mcr caused neurodegeneration glial activity ultimately led depressive effects bactolac effective reducing depressivelike behaviors according results behavioral tests bactolac treatment provided high neuronal survival rate increasing bdnf level prevented excessive release proinflammatory cytokines reducing expression levels nlrp mcr therefore prevented excessive activation hypothalamuspituitaryadrenal hpa axis accordingly reduced neurodegeneration glial cell activation depressed rats suggest bactolac supplementation may beneficial coping stress alleviate effects chronic stress help protect mental health,Systems Biology
"Patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) are usually diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, and the tumors often have immunosuppressive characteristics. Together, these factors are important for disease progression, drug resistance, and mortality. In this study, we used a combination of single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to identify the molecular mechanisms that lead to immunosuppression in HGSC. Primary tumors consistently showed a more active immune microenvironment than did omental tumors. In addition, we found that untreated primary tumors were mostly populated by dysfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells in later stages of differentiation; this, in turn, was correlated with expression changes in the interferon α and γ pathways in epithelial cells, showing that cross-communication between the epithelial and immune compartments is important for immune suppression in HGSC. These findings could have implications for the design of clinical trials with immune-modulating drugs.",Systems Biology,patients highgrade serous ovarian carcinoma hgsc usually diagnosed advancedstage disease tumors often immunosuppressive characteristics together factors important disease progression drug resistance mortality study used combination singlecell sequencing spatial transcriptomics identify molecular mechanisms lead immunosuppression hgsc primary tumors consistently showed active immune microenvironment omental tumors addition found untreated primary tumors mostly populated dysfunctional cd cd cells later stages differentiation turn correlated expression changes interferon pathways epithelial cells showing crosscommunication epithelial immune compartments important immune suppression hgsc findings could implications design clinical trials immunemodulating drugs,Systems Biology
"Implementing precision fertilization to maximize crop yield while minimizing economic and environmental impacts has become critical for agriculture. Variability in biomass response to fertilization within fields, among regions, and over time creates simultaneous risks of under-yielding and overfertilization. We quantify factors determining fertilization responsiveness (i.e., biomass increases with fertilization) up to 15 years in 61 unfertilized rangelands on six continents. We demonstrate widespread multi-year variability in responsiveness, with fertilization increasing average yield by 43% but failing to improve biomass 26% of the time. All sites were responsive at least once, but only four of 61 responded in all plots and years. Modelled management scenarios highlighted that fertilizer cessation is likely to generate sizable economic savings but always reduces yield because of the difficulty in predicting when and where biomass will be unresponsive. This work reveals substantial scale-dependent variability in fertilization responsiveness globally, while clarifying the prospects and pitfalls of managing more spatially and temporally precise nutrient application.",Systems Biology,implementing precision fertilization maximize crop yield minimizing economic environmental impacts become critical agriculture variability biomass response fertilization within fields among regions time creates simultaneous risks underyielding overfertilization quantify factors determining fertilization responsiveness ie biomass increases fertilization years unfertilized rangelands six continents demonstrate widespread multiyear variability responsiveness fertilization increasing average yield failing improve biomass time sites responsive least four responded plots years modelled management scenarios highlighted fertilizer cessation likely generate sizable economic savings always reduces yield difficulty predicting biomass unresponsive work reveals substantial scaledependent variability fertilization responsiveness globally clarifying prospects pitfalls managing spatially temporally precise nutrient application,Systems Biology
"The tumour microenvironment is composed of a complex cellular network involving cancer, stromal and immune cells in dynamic interactions. A large proportion of this network relies on direct physical interactions between cells, which may impact patient responses to clinical therapy. Doublets in scRNA-seq are usually excluded from analysis. However, they may represent directly interacting cells. To decipher the physical interaction landscape in relation to clinical prognosis, we inferred a physical cell-cell interaction (PCI) network from 'biological' doublets in a scRNA-seq dataset of approximately 18,000 cells, obtained from 7 treatment-naive ovarian cancer patients. Focusing on cancer-stromal PCIs, we uncovered molecular interaction networks and transcriptional landscapes that stratified patients in respect to their clinical responses to standard therapy. Good responders featured PCIs involving immune cells interacting with other cell types including cancer cells. Poor responders lacked immune cell interactions, but showed a high enrichment of cancer-stromal PCIs. To explore the molecular differences between cancer-stromal PCIs between responders and non-responders, we identified correlating gene signatures. We constructed ligand-receptor interaction networks and identified associated downstream pathways. The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks and trajectory analysis revealed distinct transcription factor (TF) clusters and gene modules that separated doublet cells by clinical outcomes. Our results indicate (i) that transcriptional changes resulting from PCIs predict the response of ovarian cancer patients to standard therapy, (ii) that immune reactivity of the host against the tumour enhances the efficacy of therapy, and (iii) that cancer-stromal cell interaction can have a dual effect either supporting or inhibiting therapy responses.",Systems Biology,tumour microenvironment composed complex cellular network involving cancer stromal immune cells dynamic interactions large proportion network relies direct physical interactions cells may impact patient responses clinical therapy doublets scrnaseq usually excluded analysis however may represent directly interacting cells decipher physical interaction landscape relation clinical prognosis inferred physical cellcell interaction pci network biological doublets scrnaseq dataset approximately cells obtained treatmentnaive ovarian cancer patients focusing cancerstromal pcis uncovered molecular interaction networks transcriptional landscapes stratified patients respect clinical responses standard therapy good responders featured pcis involving immune cells interacting cell types including cancer cells poor responders lacked immune cell interactions showed high enrichment cancerstromal pcis explore molecular differences cancerstromal pcis responders nonresponders identified correlating gene signatures constructed ligandreceptor interaction networks identified associated downstream pathways reconstruction gene regulatory networks trajectory analysis revealed distinct transcription factor tf clusters gene modules separated doublet cells clinical outcomes results indicate transcriptional changes resulting pcis predict response ovarian cancer patients standard therapy ii immune reactivity host tumour enhances efficacy therapy iii cancerstromal cell interaction dual effect either supporting inhibiting therapy responses,Systems Biology
"Clinical pathogen diagnostics detect targets by qPCR (but with low sensitivity) or blood culturing (but time-consuming). Here we leverage a dual-stem-loop DNA amplifier to enhance non-specific collateral enzymatic cleavage of an oligonucleotide linker between a fluophore and its quencher by CRISPR-CasΦ, achieving ultrasensitive target detection. Specifically, the target pathogens are lysed to release DNA, which binds its complementary gRNA in CRISPR-CasΦ to activate the collateral DNA-cleavage capability of CasΦ, enabling CasΦ to cleave the stem-loops in the amplifier. The cleavage product binds its complementary gRNA in another CRISPR-CasΦ to activate more CasΦ. The activated CasΦ collaterally cleaves the linker, releasing the fluophore to recover its fluorescent signal. The cycle of stem-loop-cleavage/CasΦ-activation/fluorescence-recovery amplifies the detection signal. Our target amplification-free collateral-cleavage-enhancing CRISPR-CasΦ method (TCC), with a detection limit of 0.11 copies/μL, demonstrates enhanced sensitivity compared to qPCR.

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited gastrointestinal syndrome associated with duodenal adenoma formation. Even among carriers of the same genetic variant, duodenal phenotypes vary, indicating that additional factors, such as the local immune system, play a role. We observe an increase in duodenal IL-17A(+)NKp44(-) innate lymphoid type 3 cell (ILC3) in FAP, localized near the epithelium and enriched in adenomas and carcinomas. Elevated IL1B, IL23A, and DLL4 transcript levels correlate with IL-17A(+)NKp44(-)ILC3 accumulation, and in vitro studies with duodenal organoids confirmed this relationship. Bulk RNA sequencing reveals upregulated Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-inducing enzymes DUOX2 and DUOXA2 in FAP adenomas. IL-17A-stimulated FAP organoids show increased DUOX2/DUOXA2 expression, Duox2 protein, and ROS production, leading to DNA damage, suggesting a mechanism by which these immune cells promote tumorigenesis.

"Biological invasions alter ecosystems by disrupting ecological processes that can degrade biodiversity, harm human health, and cause massive economic burdens. Existing frameworks to classify the ecological impacts either miss many types of impact or conflate mechanisms (causes) with the impacts themselves (consequences). We propose a comprehensive typology of 19 types of ecological impact across six levels of ecological organisation. This allows more accurate diagnosis of the cause of impact and can help triage management options to tackle each impact-mechanism combination. We integrated the typology with broad ecological concepts such as energy, mass, and information flow and storage.

"This study investigates the potential of chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) in enhancing the bioavailability and efficacy of Bacopa monnieri extracts, known for their neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Different concentrations of CNPs were added to the culture medium for in vitro shoot regeneration. Antioxidant activity (DPPH free radical scavenging and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> removal assays) and cytotoxicity assay (LDH release and XTT viability) were performed. The results demonstrated the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity of 95.60 % at 125 μg/mL CNPs from methanol extract. Whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging activity increased with higher extract concentrations, and the maximum was recorded from methanol extract used at 1000 μg/mL. Cytotoxicity assays revealed a dose-dependent increase in LDH activity and XTT reduction, and water-based extracts demonstrated the strongest cytotoxic effects. IC50 analysis indicated that CNP-enriched methanol and water extracts were significantly more cytotoxic to HeLa cells compared to ethanol extracts. Response surface regression analysis and ML models confirmed the reliability of the experimental data, with the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model exhibiting the best predictive accuracy, followed by the random forest (RF) model.

"Neuroendocrine cancers are a diverse and poorly understood collection of malignancies derived from neuroendocrine cells throughout the body. These cancers uniquely exhibit properties of both the nervous and endocrine systems. Only a limited number of genetic driver mutations have been identified in neuroendocrine cancers, however the mechanisms of how these genetic aberrations alter tumor biology remain elusive. Recent studies have implicated the MYC family of transcription factors as important oncogenic factors in neuroendocrine tumors. We take a systematic approach to understand the roles of the MYC family (c-MYC, n-MYC, l-MYC) in the tumorigenesis of neuroendocrine cancers of the lung, GI tract, pancreas, kidney, prostate, pediatric neuroblastoma, and adrenal glands. Reflecting the complexity of neuroendocrine cancers, we highlight the roles of the MYC family in deregulating the cell cycle and transcriptional networks, invoking cellular plasticity, affecting proliferation capacity, aiding in chromatin remodeling, angiogenesis, metabolic changes, and resistance mechanisms.

"Bacterial cell envelope polymers are commonly modified with acyl groups that provide fitness advantages. Many polymer acylation pathways involve pairs of membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) and SGNH family proteins. As an example, the MBOAT protein PatA and the SGNH protein PatB are required in Gram-negative bacteria for peptidoglycan O-acetylation. The mechanism for how MBOAT-SGNH transferases move acyl groups from acyl-CoA donors made in the cytoplasm to extracellular polymers is unclear. Using the peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase proteins PatAB, we explore the mechanism of MBOAT-SGNH pairs. We find that the MBOAT protein PatA catalyzes auto-acetylation of an invariant Tyr residue in its conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif. We also show that PatB can use a synthetic hexapeptide containing an acetylated tyrosine to donate an acetyl group to a peptidoglycan mimetic. Finally, we report the structure of PatB, finding that it has structural features that shape its activity as an O-acetyltransferase and distinguish it from other SGNH esterases and hydrolases. Taken together, our results support a model for peptidoglycan acylation in which a tyrosine-containing peptide at the MBOAT's C-terminus shuttles an acyl group from the MBOAT active site to the SGNH active site, where it is transferred to peptidoglycan. This model likely applies to other systems containing MBOAT-SGNH pairs, such as those that O-acetylate alginate, cellulose, and secondary cell wall polysaccharides.",Systems Biology,bacterial cell envelope polymers commonly modified acyl groups provide fitness advantages many polymer acylation pathways involve pairs membranebound oacyltransferase mboat sgnh family proteins example mboat protein pata sgnh protein patb required gramnegative bacteria peptidoglycan oacetylation mechanism mboatsgnh transferases move acyl groups acylcoa donors made cytoplasm extracellular polymers unclear using peptidoglycan oacetyltransferase proteins patab explore mechanism mboatsgnh pairs find mboat protein pata catalyzes autoacetylation invariant tyr residue conserved cterminal hexapeptide motif also show patb use synthetic hexapeptide containing acetylated tyrosine donate acetyl group peptidoglycan mimetic finally report structure patb finding structural features shape activity oacetyltransferase distinguish sgnh esterases hydrolases taken together results support model peptidoglycan acylation tyrosinecontaining peptide mboats cterminus shuttles acyl group mboat active site sgnh active site transferred peptidoglycan model likely applies systems containing mboatsgnh pairs oacetylate alginate cellulose secondary cell wall polysaccharides,Systems Biology
"Major features of living systems are the rates (power) and ratios (efficiency) of their energy uptake and use, whose relationships are not entirely predictable from those seen in nonliving physical systems. Although the energetic power and efficiency of production (growth and reproduction) are known to respond to differences in ration level, diet, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, why these responses vary considerably among animals is little understood and often ignored in theoretical models. In this exploratory study I show that a holistic analysis of how the different responses of the efficiencies of resource uptake and use systems to variation in food levels and associated rates of energy flow (power) helps one predict the ration-dependent efficiency of conversion of ingested energy into growth and reproduction. When the relative influence of the efficiency of assimilation (resource supply) predominates (as in many herbivores), the efficiency of converting ingested energy into production tends to vary negatively with ration level and production power, whereas when the relative influence of the efficiency of converting assimilated energy into biological tissues (resource use) predominates (as in carnivores), the ingestive production efficiency tends to vary positively with ration level and production power. I also extend this analysis by showing how studies at multiple hierarchical levels of biological organization, from cells to ecosystems, may improve our understanding of the covariation of production efficiency with ration level or overall rate of energy flow (power). A new comprehensive theory of the power and efficiency of living systems is advocated.",Systems Biology,major features living systems rates power ratios efficiency energy uptake use whose relationships entirely predictable seen nonliving physical systems although energetic power efficiency production growth reproduction known respond differences ration level diet intrinsic extrinsic factors responses vary considerably among animals little understood often ignored theoretical models exploratory study show holistic analysis different responses efficiencies resource uptake use systems variation food levels associated rates energy flow power helps one predict rationdependent efficiency conversion ingested energy growth reproduction relative influence efficiency assimilation resource supply predominates many herbivores efficiency converting ingested energy production tends vary negatively ration level production power whereas relative influence efficiency converting assimilated energy biological tissues resource use predominates carnivores ingestive production efficiency tends vary positively ration level production power also extend analysis showing studies multiple hierarchical levels biological organization cells ecosystems may improve understanding covariation production efficiency ration level overall rate energy flow power new comprehensive theory power efficiency living systems advocated,Systems Biology
"Quantifying dynamic changes in cell populations is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of biological processes such as cell proliferation, injury repair, and disease progression. However, compared to directly measuring the absolute cell numbers of specific subpopulations, relative proportion data demonstrate greater reproducibility and yield more stable, reliable outcomes. Therefore, inferring absolute cell numbers from relative proportion data may present a novel approach for effectively predicting changes in cell population sizes. To address this, we establish two mathematical mappings between cell proportions and population sizes using moment equations derived from stochastic cell-plasticity models. Notably, our findings indicate that one of these mappings does not require prior knowledge of the initial population size, highlighting the value of incorporating variance information into cell proportion data. We evaluated the robustness of our methods from multiple perspectives and extended their application to various biological mechanisms within the context of cell plasticity models. These methods help mitigate the limitations associated with the direct measurement of absolute cell counts through experimental techniques. Moreover, they provide new insights into leveraging the stochastic dynamics of cell populations to quantify interactions between different biomasses within the system.",Systems Biology,quantifying dynamic changes cell populations crucial comprehensive understanding biological processes cell proliferation injury repair disease progression however compared directly measuring absolute cell numbers specific subpopulations relative proportion data demonstrate greater reproducibility yield stable reliable outcomes therefore inferring absolute cell numbers relative proportion data may present novel approach effectively predicting changes cell population sizes address establish two mathematical mappings cell proportions population sizes using moment equations derived stochastic cellplasticity models notably findings indicate one mappings require prior knowledge initial population size highlighting value incorporating variance information cell proportion data evaluated robustness methods multiple perspectives extended application various biological mechanisms within context cell plasticity models methods help mitigate limitations associated direct measurement absolute cell counts experimental techniques moreover provide new insights leveraging stochastic dynamics cell populations quantify interactions different biomasses within system,Systems Biology
"Childhood asthma has been linked to distinct metabolomic profiles. To identify phenotypes (metabotypes) in children with moderate-to-severe asthma through integrative fecal and serum metabolome analysis. Children from the Systems Pharmacology Approach to Uncontrolled Pediatric Asthma cohort with Global Initiative for Asthma treatment step ≥3 were recruited. Asthma control was defined by the Asthma Control Test and annual exacerbation history. Targeted metabolomics profiling of feces and serum was performed using liquid chromatography and flow injection electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Similarity Network Fusion integrated fecal and serum metabolome profiles, followed by spectral clustering. Clusters were analyzed for differences in asthma characteristics, food diaries, fecal microbiota composition, and levels of serum inflammatory markers and blood cells. Integrative fecal and serum metabolome analysis of 92 children with moderate-to-severe asthma (median age: 11.5 years, 34% female) revealed three metabotypes. Metabotype1 had the lowest percentage of allergic rhinitis, with elevated serum ceramides and triglycerides. Metabotype2 had higher odds of asthma control, the highest percentage of children with ≥4 months of breastfeeding, reduced sugar intake, lowest levels of blood neutrophils and serum inflammatory markers, and with elevated serum acylcarnitines and ω-3 fatty acids. Metabotype3 included the highest percentage of uncontrolled asthma patients, with decreased serum cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins, elevated fecal amino acids, and reduced fecal microbiota diversity. Metabotypes in children with moderate-to-severe asthma are linked to asthma control, distinct fecal microbiota and systemic inflammatory patterns.

"Thrombotic diseases remain the major cause of death and disability worldwide, and the contribution of inflammation is increasingly recognized. Thromboinflammation has been identified as a key pathomechanism, but an unsupervised map of immune-cell states, trajectories, and intercommunication at a single-cell level has been lacking. Here, we reveal innate leukocyte substates with prominent thrombolytic properties by employing single-cell omics measures on human stroke thrombi. Using in vivo and in vitro thrombosis models, we propose a pro-resolving monocyte-neutrophil axis, combining two properties: (1) NR4A1<sup>hi</sup> non-classical monocytes acquire a thrombolytic and neutrophil-chemoattractive phenotype, and (2) blood neutrophils are thereby continuously recruited to established thrombi through CXCL8-CXCR1 and CXCR2 and adopt a hypoxia-induced thrombus-resolving urokinase receptor (PLAUR)<sup>+</sup> phenotype. This immunothrombolytic axis results in thrombus resolution.

"Double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC), characterized by an androgen receptor (AR)- and neuroendocrine-null phenotype, frequently emerges following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, our understanding of the origins and regulatory mechanisms of DNPC remains limited. Here, we discover that tumors with KMT2C mutation or loss are highly susceptible to transitioning into DNPC following ADT. We clarify that DNPC primarily stems from luminal cell transdifferentiation rather than basal cell transformation. Antiandrogen treatment induces KMT2C binding at enhancers of a subset of AR-regulated genes, preserving the adenocarcinoma lineage. KMT2C maintains ASPP2 expression via enhancer-promoter communication post-AR inhibition, while its inactivation reduces ASPP2, triggering ΔNp63-dependent transdifferentiation. This DNPC transition maintains fatty acid (FA) synthesis through ΔNp63-mediated SREBP1c transactivation, fueling DNPC growth via HRAS palmitoylation and MAPK signaling activation. These findings highlight KMT2C as an epigenetic checkpoint against DNPC development and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting fatty acid synthesis.",Systems Biology,doublenegative prostate cancer dnpc characterized androgen receptor ar neuroendocrinenull phenotype frequently emerges following androgen deprivation therapy adt however understanding origins regulatory mechanisms dnpc remains limited discover tumors kmtc mutation loss highly susceptible transitioning dnpc following adt clarify dnpc primarily stems luminal cell transdifferentiation rather basal cell transformation antiandrogen treatment induces kmtc binding enhancers subset arregulated genes preserving adenocarcinoma lineage kmtc maintains aspp expression via enhancerpromoter communication postar inhibition inactivation reduces aspp triggering npdependent transdifferentiation dnpc transition maintains fatty acid fa synthesis npmediated srebpc transactivation fueling dnpc growth via hras palmitoylation mapk signaling activation findings highlight kmtc epigenetic checkpoint dnpc development suggest therapeutic potential targeting fatty acid synthesis,Systems Biology
"Butyl xanthate (BuX) is an emerging pollutant due to wide use as flotation collector, posing a serious threat to ecosystem health in mining areas. Here we develop a combinational plant-microbe remediation strategy for restoration of BuX-contaminated mining areas. A novel bacterial strain that completely degraded up to 1000 mg/L of BuX within 12 h was isolated and identified as Pseudomonas monteilii W50. It was found to harbor good tolerance to extreme environmental conditions and multiple plant growth-promoting traits such as phosphate and potassium solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellin production, and cellulose degradation. This strain can colonize in the rhizosphere of an emergent macrophyte Cyperus alternifolius, improving removal of BuX and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from simulated wastewater. Compared to the phytoremediation alone, the removal of BuX and COD increased from 70 % to 98 % and from 21 % to 46 % respectively in the combined remediation The strain W50 protected the macrophyte from the phytotoxicity of BuX and the macrophyte provided it with a suitable habitat for return, benefiting each other. Compared to the individual treatment using C. alternifolius or strain W50, the combinational treatment significantly improved the plant growth and the residence of inoculated bacteria.

"Microbial metal resistance, a trait that enables microorganisms to withstand high levels of toxic metals, has been studied for over a century. The significance of uncovering these mechanisms goes beyond basic science as they have implications for human health through their connection to microbial pathogenesis, metal bioremediation, and biomining. Recent advances in analytical chemistry and molecular biology have accelerated the discovery and understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying microbial metal resistance, identifying specific metal resistance genes and their operons. The emergence of omics tools has further propelled research towards a comprehensive understanding of how cells respond to metal stress at the systemic level, revealing the complex regulatory networks and evolutionary dynamics that drive microbial adaptation to metal-rich environments. In this article, we present a historical overview of the evolving understanding of the genetic determinants of metal resistance in microbes. Through multiple narrative threads, we illustrate how our knowledge of microbial metal resistance and genetics has interacted with genetic tools and concept development.

"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are vital polysaccharides that constitute key elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly within chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). GAGs exhibit a dual role in neural tissue: they facilitate synaptic plasticity and cellular adhesion, essential for neural function, while posing as barriers to axonal regeneration following injury. Through interactions with diverse proteins, including enzymes, cytokines, and growth factors, GAGs critically influence neural development, repair, and homeostasis. Recent advancements have underscored the therapeutic potential of modulating GAG synthesis, degradation, and receptor interactions to address neuroinflammation, promote neural repair, and counteract inhibitory signals in the injured CNS. Furthermore, combining GAG-targeted therapies with complementary approaches, such as gene therapy or nanoparticle-based delivery systems, holds promise for achieving synergistic effects and enhancing treatment outcomes.

"Apoptosis is now recognized as a highly dynamic process that involves the release of a large set of signaling molecules that convey information to cells neighboring an apoptotic site. Recent studies in epithelial systems have discovered that apoptotic cells trigger waves of pulses of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) / extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activity in their neighbors. At the single-cell level, the ERK pulses emerge from the MAPK pathway's excitable network properties, such as ultrasensitivity and adaptation. At the cell population level, apoptosis-induced ERK waves (AiEWs) emerge from propagation of ERK pulses across cells via a mechanism that involves mechanical inputs and paracrine signaling. AiEWs enable cell populations to dynamically coordinate fate decision signaling during tissue homeostasis and development. This spatio-temporal signaling mechanism can be hijacked by cancer cells to induce drug-tolerant persister states when apoptosis is triggered by cytotoxic or targeted therapies, undermining treatment efficacy. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of AiEWs, including their initiation, propagation, and coordination of fate decision signaling within a population. We discuss how the relatively simple properties of single cells, and their interactions within a collective coordinate these dynamic signaling patterns. We highlight their implication in resistance to cancer therapy and explore potential strategies to target these waves to re-sensitize cancer cells. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies and future directions to expand the study of this biological phenomenon.",Systems Biology,apoptosis recognized highly dynamic process involves release large set signaling molecules convey information cells neighboring apoptotic site recent studies epithelial systems discovered apoptotic cells trigger waves pulses mitogenactivated protein kinase mapk extracellular signalregulated kinase erk pathway activity neighbors singlecell level erk pulses emerge mapk pathways excitable network properties ultrasensitivity adaptation cell population level apoptosisinduced erk waves aiews emerge propagation erk pulses across cells via mechanism involves mechanical inputs paracrine signaling aiews enable cell populations dynamically coordinate fate decision signaling tissue homeostasis development spatiotemporal signaling mechanism hijacked cancer cells induce drugtolerant persister states apoptosis triggered cytotoxic targeted therapies undermining treatment efficacy review summarize current understanding aiews including initiation propagation coordination fate decision signaling within population discuss relatively simple properties single cells interactions within collective coordinate dynamic signaling patterns highlight implication resistance cancer therapy explore potential strategies target waves resensitize cancer cells finally discuss emerging technologies future directions expand study biological phenomenon,Systems Biology
"Actin, the most abundant cellular protein, is essential for maintaining structural organization, mechanical stability and cellular motility. The actin cytoskeleton undergoes continuous ATP-dependent reorganization, incurring significant energy costs through treadmilling. However, experimental quantifications of these energy expenditures, especially in ectotherms, remain scarce. In this study, we assessed the energy costs of actin remodeling in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea [also Magallana] gigas, a marine bivalve, by measuring oxygen consumption in the presence of inhibitors of actin treadmilling (latrunculin B, jasplakinolide and cytochalasin D). Our results indicate that under normal physiological conditions, actin remodeling contributes less than 5% to the cellular energy budget in gill and mantle cells of oysters. Unexpectedly, cytochalasin D induced a marked increase in mitochondrial proton leak, observed both in intact cells and isolated mitochondria, suggesting a connection between actin disorganization and increased mitochondrial maintenance costs. Notably, jasplakinolide and latrunculin B, which inhibit actin treadmilling through different mechanisms from those of cytochalasin D, had no effect on mitochondrial respiration. This suggests that different mechanisms of actin cytoskeleton disruption can lead to distinct cellular outcomes. Given the significant role of proton leak in cellular respiration, these findings suggest that actin dynamics may play a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial metabolism, with broad implications for cellular energy costs. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of actin-mitochondria interactions and their broader relevance to the regulation of cellular metabolism in ectothermic species.",Systems Biology,actin abundant cellular protein essential maintaining structural organization mechanical stability cellular motility actin cytoskeleton undergoes continuous atpdependent reorganization incurring significant energy costs treadmilling however experimental quantifications energy expenditures especially ectotherms remain scarce study assessed energy costs actin remodeling pacific oyster crassostrea also magallana gigas marine bivalve measuring oxygen consumption presence inhibitors actin treadmilling latrunculin b jasplakinolide cytochalasin results indicate normal physiological conditions actin remodeling contributes less cellular energy budget gill mantle cells oysters unexpectedly cytochalasin induced marked increase mitochondrial proton leak observed intact cells isolated mitochondria suggesting connection actin disorganization increased mitochondrial maintenance costs notably jasplakinolide latrunculin b inhibit actin treadmilling different mechanisms cytochalasin effect mitochondrial respiration suggests different mechanisms actin cytoskeleton disruption lead distinct cellular outcomes given significant role proton leak cellular respiration findings suggest actin dynamics may play crucial role regulating mitochondrial metabolism broad implications cellular energy costs studies needed elucidate underlying mechanisms actinmitochondria interactions broader relevance regulation cellular metabolism ectothermic species,Systems Biology
"The growing field of human synthetic biology has rapidly accelerated the development of programmable genetic systems that can control cellular phenotypes and function.

"Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial and temporal information within the original data space. This study proposes a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrate the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.",Systems Biology,discovering dominant patterns exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions tipping points highdimensional timeseries data challenging tasks study realworld complex systems demand interpretable data representations facilitate comprehension spatial temporal information within original data space study proposes general analytical ultralowdimensionality reduction method dynamical systems named spatialtemporal principal component analysis stpca fully represent dynamics highdimensional timeseries single latent variable without distortion transforms highdimensional spatial information onedimensional temporal information based nonlinear delayembedding theory dynamics single variable analytically solved theoretically preserves temporal property original highdimensional timeseries thereby accurately reliably identifying tipping point upcoming critical transition applications realworld datasets individualspecific heterogeneous icu records demonstrate effectiveness stpca quantitatively robustly provides earlywarning signals criticaltipping state patient,Systems Biology
"Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in nonautonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as exp[-α(lnδ)^{2}], where δ is the distance from the critical point, while α is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.",Systems Biology,many dynamical systems operate fluctuating environment however even lowdimensional setups transitions bifurcations yet fully understood letter focus crises sudden flooding phase space due crossing boundary basin attraction find crises occur also nonautonomous systems although underlying mechanism complex show vicinity transition escape probability scales expln distance critical point modeldependent parameter prediction tested verified different systems including kuramoto model inertia crisis controls loss stability chimera state,Systems Biology
"Biomolecules stochastically occupy different configurations that correspond to distinct functional states. Changing biochemical inputs such as rate constants alters the output probability distribution of configurations, and thus constitutes a form of computation. In the cell, such computations are often coupled to thermodynamic forces such as ATP hydrolysis that drive systems far from equilibrium, resulting in energy expenditure even during times when computations are not being performed. The information-theoretic advantage of this costly computational paradigm is unclear. Here we introduce a theoretical framework showing how much the thermodynamic force enables changes in probability distributions, quantified by the information gain, beyond what is possible at equilibrium. Using this framework, we derive a general expression relating the force to the maximum information gain in an arbitrary computation, revealing how small input changes can exponentially alter outputs. We numerically show that biomolecular systems can closely approach this universal bound, illustrating how energy expenditure is needed to achieve the information processing capabilities observed in nature.",Systems Biology,biomolecules stochastically occupy different configurations correspond distinct functional states changing biochemical inputs rate constants alters output probability distribution configurations thus constitutes form computation cell computations often coupled thermodynamic forces atp hydrolysis drive systems far equilibrium resulting energy expenditure even times computations performed informationtheoretic advantage costly computational paradigm unclear introduce theoretical framework showing much thermodynamic force enables changes probability distributions quantified information gain beyond possible equilibrium using framework derive general expression relating force maximum information gain arbitrary computation revealing small input changes exponentially alter outputs numerically show biomolecular systems closely approach universal bound illustrating energy expenditure needed achieve information processing capabilities observed nature,Systems Biology
"The health care sector's digital transformation has accelerated, yet adverse drug events continue to rise, posing significant clinical and economic challenges. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs), particularly those related to medication, are crucial for improving patient care, identifying drug-related problems, and reducing adverse drug events. Hospital pharmacists play a key role in using CDSSs for patient management and safety. Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) methods are essential for designing effective, human-centered CDSSs. HFE involves 3 phases-exploration, design, and evaluation-with exploration being critical yet often overlooked in the literature. For medication-related CDSSs, understanding hospital pharmacists' tasks and challenges is vital for creating user-centered solutions. This study aimed to explore the actual practices and identify the needs of hospital pharmacists analyzing electronic prescriptions. This study focused on the preliminary stage of the user-centered design of a pharmacist-centered CDSS. The study involved observing 16 pharmacists across 5 hospitals in mainland France (a university hospital, 2 large general hospitals, a smaller general hospital, and a specialized clinic). Pharmacists were selected regardless of expertise. The observation method-systematic in situ observation with shadowing posture-involved following pharmacists as they analyzed prescriptions. Researchers recorded activities, tools used, verbalizations, behaviors, and interruptions, using an observation grid. Data analysis focused on modeling pharmacists' cognitive work, categorizing activities by action type, specificity, and information source. Sequential time data analysis and distance matrices were used to generate hierarchical clustering and identify similarity groups among the pharmacists' analyses. Each group was described using its typical sequences of analysis and related covariates. In total, 16 pharmacists analyzed and validated electronic prescriptions for 140 patients, averaging 5.48 minutes per patient. They spend 91% of their time searching for information rather than transmitting it. Most information comes from the list of prescriptions, but it is the time spent in electronic medical records (EMRs) that dominates at the heart of the analysis. Pharmaceutical interventions are most frequently transmitted in the last third of the sequence. The pharmaceutical analyses were grouped into 4 clusters: (cluster A, 22%) interventionist clinical analysis with extensive crossing of various sources of information and almost systematic pharmaceutical interventions; (cluster B, 52%) most common clinical analysis focusing on EMRs and biology results; (cluster C, 13%) logistical analysis, focusing on the pharmacy workflow and the medication circuit; and (cluster D, 13%) quick, trivial analyses based exclusively on the list of prescriptions. The pharmaceutical analysis process is complex and multifaceted. Pharmacists are detectives, accessing a wealth of information to discriminate drug-related problems and respond accordingly. They also carry out different types of analysis, which lead to different needs and require different solutions from CDSSs. This exploratory study is an essential prerequisite for meeting the challenge of designing tools to support pharmaceutical analysis and pharmacists.",Systems Biology,health care sectors digital transformation accelerated yet adverse drug events continue rise posing significant clinical economic challenges clinical decision support systems cdsss particularly related medication crucial improving patient care identifying drugrelated problems reducing adverse drug events hospital pharmacists play key role using cdsss patient management safety human factors ergonomics hfe methods essential designing effective humancentered cdsss hfe involves phasesexploration design evaluationwith exploration critical yet often overlooked literature medicationrelated cdsss understanding hospital pharmacists tasks challenges vital creating usercentered solutions study aimed explore actual practices identify needs hospital pharmacists analyzing electronic prescriptions study focused preliminary stage usercentered design pharmacistcentered cdss study involved observing pharmacists across hospitals mainland france university hospital large general hospitals smaller general hospital specialized clinic pharmacists selected regardless expertise observation methodsystematic situ observation shadowing postureinvolved following pharmacists analyzed prescriptions researchers recorded activities tools used verbalizations behaviors interruptions using observation grid data analysis focused modeling pharmacists cognitive work categorizing activities action type specificity information source sequential time data analysis distance matrices used generate hierarchical clustering identify similarity groups among pharmacists analyses group described using typical sequences analysis related covariates total pharmacists analyzed validated electronic prescriptions patients averaging minutes per patient spend time searching information rather transmitting information comes list prescriptions time spent electronic medical records emrs dominates heart analysis pharmaceutical interventions frequently transmitted last third sequence pharmaceutical analyses grouped clusters cluster interventionist clinical analysis extensive crossing various sources information almost systematic pharmaceutical interventions cluster b common clinical analysis focusing emrs biology results cluster c logistical analysis focusing pharmacy workflow medication circuit cluster quick trivial analyses based exclusively list prescriptions pharmaceutical analysis process complex multifaceted pharmacists detectives accessing wealth information discriminate drugrelated problems respond accordingly also carry different types analysis lead different needs require different solutions cdsss exploratory study essential prerequisite meeting challenge designing tools support pharmaceutical analysis pharmacists,Systems Biology
"Venom-secreting glands are highly specialised organs evolved throughout the animal kingdom to synthetise and secrete toxins for predation and defence. Venom is extensively studied for its toxin components and application potential; yet, how animals become venomous remains poorly understood. Venom systems therefore offer a unique opportunity to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying functional innovation. Here, we conducted a multi-species multi-tissue comparative transcriptomics analysis of 12 marine predatory gastropod species, including species with venom glands and species with homologous non-venom producing glands, to examine how specialised functions evolve through gene expression changes. We found that while the venom gland specialised for the mass production of toxins, its homologous glands retained the ancestral digestive functions. The functional divergence and specialisation of the venom gland was achieved through a redistribution of its ancestral digestive functions to other organs, specifically the oesophagus. This entailed concerted expression changes and accelerated transcriptome evolution across the entire digestive system. The increase in venom gland secretory capacity was achieved through the modulation of an ancient secretory machinery, particularly genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. This study shifts the focus from the well-explored evolution of toxins to the lesser-known evolution of the organ and mechanisms responsible for venom production. As such, it contributes to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying organ evolution at a fine evolutionary scale, highlighting the specific events that lead to functional divergence.",Systems Biology,venomsecreting glands highly specialised organs evolved throughout animal kingdom synthetise secrete toxins predation defence venom extensively studied toxin components application potential yet animals become venomous remains poorly understood venom systems therefore offer unique opportunity understand molecular mechanisms underlying functional innovation conducted multispecies multitissue comparative transcriptomics analysis marine predatory gastropod species including species venom glands species homologous nonvenom producing glands examine specialised functions evolve gene expression changes found venom gland specialised mass production toxins homologous glands retained ancestral digestive functions functional divergence specialisation venom gland achieved redistribution ancestral digestive functions organs specifically oesophagus entailed concerted expression changes accelerated transcriptome evolution across entire digestive system increase venom gland secretory capacity achieved modulation ancient secretory machinery particularly genes involved endoplasmic reticulum stress unfolded protein response study shifts focus wellexplored evolution toxins lesserknown evolution organ mechanisms responsible venom production contributes elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying organ evolution fine evolutionary scale highlighting specific events lead functional divergence,Systems Biology

"Coordinated cell cycle regulation is essential for homeostasis, with most cells in the body residing in quiescence (G<sub>0</sub>). Many pathologies arise due to disruptions in tissue-specific G<sub>0</sub>, yet little is known about the temporal-spatial mechanisms that establish G<sub>0</sub> and its signaling hub, primary cilia. Mechanistic insight is limited by asynchronous model systems and failure to connect context-specific, transient mechanisms to function. To address this gap, we developed STAMP (synchronized temporal-spatial analysis via microscopy and phosphoproteomics) to track changes in cellular landscape occurring throughout G<sub>0</sub> transition and ciliogenesis.

"The centrosome is a microtubule orchestrator, nucleating and anchoring microtubules that grow radially and exert forces on cargos. At the same time, mechanical stresses from the microenvironment and cellular shape changes compress and bend microtubules. Yet, centrosomes are membraneless organelles, raising the question of how centrosomes withstand mechanical forces. Here, we discover that centrosomes can deform and even fracture. We reveal that centrosomes experience deformations during navigational pathfinding within motile cells. Coherence of the centrosome is maintained by Dyrk3 and cNAP1, preventing fracturing by forces. While cells can compensate for the depletion of centriolar-based centrosomes, the fracturing of centrosomes impedes cellular function by generating coexisting microtubule organizing centers that compete during path navigation and thereby cause cellular entanglement in the microenvironment. Our findings show that cells actively maintain the integrity of the centrosome to withstand mechanical forces. These results suggest that centrosome stability preservation is fundamental, given that almost all cells in multicellular organisms experience forces.",Systems Biology,centrosome microtubule orchestrator nucleating anchoring microtubules grow radially exert forces cargos time mechanical stresses microenvironment cellular shape changes compress bend microtubules yet centrosomes membraneless organelles raising question centrosomes withstand mechanical forces discover centrosomes deform even fracture reveal centrosomes experience deformations navigational pathfinding within motile cells coherence centrosome maintained dyrk cnap preventing fracturing forces cells compensate depletion centriolarbased centrosomes fracturing centrosomes impedes cellular function generating coexisting microtubule organizing centers compete path navigation thereby cause cellular entanglement microenvironment findings show cells actively maintain integrity centrosome withstand mechanical forces results suggest centrosome stability preservation fundamental given almost cells multicellular organisms experience forces,Systems Biology
"The distribution of sugars is crucial for plant energy, signaling, and defense mechanisms. Sugar Transport Proteins (STPs) are Sugar Porters (SPs) that mediate proton-driven cellular uptake of glucose. Some STPs also transport fructose, while others remain highly selective for only glucose. What determines this selectivity, allowing STPs to distinguish between compounds with highly similar chemical composition, remains unknown. Here, we present the structure of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> STP6 in an inward-occluded conformational state with glucose bound and demonstrate its role as both a glucose and fructose transporter. We perform a comparative analysis of STP6 with the glucose-selective STP10 using in vivo and in vitro systems, demonstrating how different experimental setups strongly influence kinetic transport properties. We analyze the properties of the monosaccharide binding site and show that the position of a single methyl group in the binding site is sufficient to shuffle glucose and fructose specificity, providing detailed insights into the fine-tuned dynamics of affinity-induced specificity for sugar uptake. Altogether, these findings enhance our understanding of sugar selectivity in STPs and more broadly SP proteins.",Systems Biology,distribution sugars crucial plant energy signaling defense mechanisms sugar transport proteins stps sugar porters sps mediate protondriven cellular uptake glucose stps also transport fructose others remain highly selective glucose determines selectivity allowing stps distinguish compounds highly similar chemical composition remains unknown present structure iarabidopsis thalianai stp inwardoccluded conformational state glucose bound demonstrate role glucose fructose transporter perform comparative analysis stp glucoseselective stp using vivo vitro systems demonstrating different experimental setups strongly influence kinetic transport properties analyze properties monosaccharide binding site show position single methyl group binding site sufficient shuffle glucose fructose specificity providing detailed insights finetuned dynamics affinityinduced specificity sugar uptake altogether findings enhance understanding sugar selectivity stps broadly sp proteins,Systems Biology
"Inherited erythromelalgia, small fiber neuropathy and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder are caused by gain-of-function mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel Nav1.7. How different mutations in the same channel enhancing electrogenesis in sensory neurons results in such distinct disease presentations remains unknown. Most of the work analysing the impact of these mutations on electrophysiological properties has utilized over-expression systems in cell lines and rodent sensory neurons, which may differ from the natural context. We have differentiated sensory neurons from iPSCs derived from patient samples that have the Nav1.7 A1632G mutation. This strategy reveals changes in electrophysiological properties not previously observed in cell lines, that may be important for disease presentation. Further, using CRISPR/Cas9, we corrected this mutation which reduced the underlying hyperexcitability, providing a path for personalized medicine to treat these disorders and introduced the mutation into control iPSCs which generated hyperexcitability providing causality. iPSC sensory neurons are a robust, scalable, and relevant model to study the effects of gain-of-function mutations in ion channels in pain-related disorders.",Systems Biology,inherited erythromelalgia small fiber neuropathy paroxysmal extreme pain disorder caused gainoffunction mutations voltage gated sodium channel nav different mutations channel enhancing electrogenesis sensory neurons results distinct disease presentations remains unknown work analysing impact mutations electrophysiological properties utilized overexpression systems cell lines rodent sensory neurons may differ natural context differentiated sensory neurons ipscs derived patient samples nav ag mutation strategy reveals changes electrophysiological properties previously observed cell lines may important disease presentation using crisprcas corrected mutation reduced underlying hyperexcitability providing path personalized medicine treat disorders introduced mutation control ipscs generated hyperexcitability providing causality ipsc sensory neurons robust scalable relevant model study effects gainoffunction mutations ion channels painrelated disorders,Systems Biology
"The immune system, critical for human health and implicated in many diseases, defends against pathogens, monitors physiological stress, and maintains tissue and organismal homeostasis. It exhibits substantial variability both within and across individuals and populations. Recent technological and conceptual progress in systems human immunology has provided predictive insights that link personal immune states to intervention responses and disease susceptibilities. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML), has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing complex immune data sets, revealing hidden patterns across biological scales, and enabling predictive models for individualistic immune responses and potentially personalized interventions. This review highlights recent advances in deciphering human immune variation and predicting outcomes, particularly through the concepts of immune setpoint, immune health, and use of the immune system as a window for measuring health.

"Global consumption led to increased and persistent plastic pollution in aquatic environments, affecting aquatic biota. Polystyrene (PS) is a synthetic polymer and one of the most widely used plastics. This study aims to investigate the acute and chronic effects of PS microplastics on <i>Cyprinus carpio</i> using an adapted OECD methodology. For the acute test, PS was tested in different particle sizes (20, 200, and 430 µm), each at concentrations of 0, 1, 10, and 100 mg PS/L. Mortality and clinical signs were monitored after 96 h of exposure. No acute effects were recorded. In the chronic test, a mix of PS particles of different sizes (20, 200, and 430 µm) at a total concentration of 1.2 mg PS/L was used for a 75-day fish exposure. Mortality, biometric parameters, physiological indices, and antioxidant enzyme activities, including catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GRed), glutathione S-transferase (GST), 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), lipid peroxidation (MDA), hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase-ALT and aspartate aminotransferase-AST), vitellogenin (VTG), and acetylcholinesterase (ACh), were assessed. Fish exposed to the PS mix exhibited a 40% change in hepatosomatic indices after 75 days. Additionally, the PS mix induced oxidative stress in fish organs. CAT activity increased fourfold in the intestine, GRed activity increased thirtyfold in the gonads, and GST activity doubled in the brain. GRed activity also increased in the gills but was not statistically significant compared to the control. Lipid peroxidation was observed in the kidney (twofold increase) and was also detected in the gills and intestine; however, these changes were not statistically significant. EROD activity increased by 15% compared to the control group, indicating an amplification of stress enzyme expression. The activity of hepatic enzymes ALT and AST increased nine to tenfold compared to the control. VTG activity increased by 47%, and ACh activity showed more than 80% inhibition in the brain and muscle. Furthermore, an overall amplification of protein expression in the intestine and liver was observed compared to the control group. Our study revealed the incidence and severity of PS microplastic effects on freshwater fish and emphasized the urgent need for prevention, monitoring, and mitigation measures to combat microplastic pollution.",Systems Biology,global consumption led increased persistent plastic pollution aquatic environments affecting aquatic biota polystyrene ps synthetic polymer one widely used plastics study aims investigate acute chronic effects ps microplastics icyprinus carpioi using adapted oecd methodology acute test ps tested different particle sizes concentrations mg psl mortality clinical signs monitored h exposure acute effects recorded chronic test mix ps particles different sizes total concentration mg psl used day fish exposure mortality biometric parameters physiological indices antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase cat glutathione reductase gred glutathione stransferase gst ethoxyresorufinodeethylase erod lipid peroxidation mda hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferasealt aspartate aminotransferaseast vitellogenin vtg acetylcholinesterase ach assessed fish exposed ps mix exhibited change hepatosomatic indices days additionally ps mix induced oxidative stress fish organs cat activity increased fourfold intestine gred activity increased thirtyfold gonads gst activity doubled brain gred activity also increased gills statistically significant compared control lipid peroxidation observed kidney twofold increase also detected gills intestine however changes statistically significant erod activity increased compared control group indicating amplification stress enzyme expression activity hepatic enzymes alt ast increased nine tenfold compared control vtg activity increased ach activity showed inhibition brain muscle furthermore overall amplification protein expression intestine liver observed compared control group study revealed incidence severity ps microplastic effects freshwater fish emphasized urgent need prevention monitoring mitigation measures combat microplastic pollution,Systems Biology
"Spatial patterns are widely observed in numerous nonequilibrium natural systems, often undergoing complex transitions and bifurcations, thereby exhibiting significant importance in many physical and biological systems such as embryonic development, ecosystem desertification, and turbulence. However, how spatial pattern formation emerges and how the spatial pattern switches are not fully understood. Here, a landscape-flux field theory is developed using the spatial mode expansion method to uncover the underlying physical mechanism of the pattern formation and switching. The landscape and flux field are identified as the driving force for spatial dynamics and applied this theory to the critical transitions between spatial vegetation patterns in semi-arid ecosystems, revealing that the nonequilibrium flux drives the switchings of spatial patterns. The emergence of pattern switching is revealed through the optimal pathways and how fast this occurs via the speed of pattern switching. Furthermore, both the averaged flux and the entropy production rate exhibit peaks near pattern switching boundaries, revealing dynamical and thermodynamical origins for pattern transitions, and further offering early warning signals for anticipating spatial pattern switching. This work thus reveals physical mechanisms on spatial pattern-switching in semi-arid ecosystems and, more generally, introduces a useful approach for quantifying spatial pattern switching in nonequilibrium systems, which further offers practical applications such as early warning signals for critical transitions of spatial patterns.",Systems Biology,spatial patterns widely observed numerous nonequilibrium natural systems often undergoing complex transitions bifurcations thereby exhibiting significant importance many physical biological systems embryonic development ecosystem desertification turbulence however spatial pattern formation emerges spatial pattern switches fully understood landscapeflux field theory developed using spatial mode expansion method uncover underlying physical mechanism pattern formation switching landscape flux field identified driving force spatial dynamics applied theory critical transitions spatial vegetation patterns semiarid ecosystems revealing nonequilibrium flux drives switchings spatial patterns emergence pattern switching revealed optimal pathways fast occurs via speed pattern switching furthermore averaged flux entropy production rate exhibit peaks near pattern switching boundaries revealing dynamical thermodynamical origins pattern transitions offering early warning signals anticipating spatial pattern switching work thus reveals physical mechanisms spatial patternswitching semiarid ecosystems generally introduces useful approach quantifying spatial pattern switching nonequilibrium systems offers practical applications early warning signals critical transitions spatial patterns,Systems Biology
"The presence and concentration of lipids in serum of dairy cows have significant implications for both animal health and productivity and are potential biomarkers for several common diseases. However, information on serum lipid composition is rather fragmented, and lipid remodelling during the transition period is only partially understood. Using a combination of reversed-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS), hydrophilic interaction-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS), and lipid annotation software, we performed a comprehensive identification and quantification of serum of dairy cows in pasture-based Holstein-Friesian cows. The lipid remodelling induced by negative energy balance was investigated by comparing the levels of all identified lipids between the fresh lactation (5-14 days in milk, DIM) and full lactation (65-80 DIM) stages. We identified 535 lipid molecular species belonging to 19 classes. The most abundant lipid class was cholesteryl ester (CE), followed by phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and free fatty acid (FFA), whereas the least abundant lipids included phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), acylcarnitine (AcylCar), ceramide (Cer), glucosylceramide (GluCer), and lactosylceramide (LacCer). A remarkable increase in most lipids and a dramatic decrease in FFAs, AcylCar, and DHA-containing species were observed at the full lactation compared to fresh lactation stage. Several serum lipid biomarkers for detecting negative energy balance in cows were also identified.",Systems Biology,presence concentration lipids serum dairy cows significant implications animal health productivity potential biomarkers several common diseases however information serum lipid composition rather fragmented lipid remodelling transition period partially understood using combination reversedphase liquid chromatographymass spectrometry rplcms hydrophilic interactionmass spectrometry hilicms lipid annotation software performed comprehensive identification quantification serum dairy cows pasturebased holsteinfriesian cows lipid remodelling induced negative energy balance investigated comparing levels identified lipids fresh lactation days milk dim full lactation dim stages identified lipid molecular species belonging classes abundant lipid class cholesteryl ester ce followed phosphatidylcholine pc sphingomyelin sm free fatty acid ffa whereas least abundant lipids included phosphatidylserine ps phosphatidic acid pa phosphatidylglycerol pg acylcarnitine acylcar ceramide cer glucosylceramide glucer lactosylceramide laccer remarkable increase lipids dramatic decrease ffas acylcar dhacontaining species observed full lactation compared fresh lactation stage several serum lipid biomarkers detecting negative energy balance cows also identified,Systems Biology
"Drug development for complex diseases such as NAFLD is often lengthy and expensive. Drug repurposing, the process of finding new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, presents a promising alternative to traditional approaches. This study aims to identify potential repurposed drugs for NAFLD by leveraging disease-disease relationships and drug-target data from the BioSNAP database. A bipartite network was constructed between drugs and their target genes, followed by the application of the BiClusO bi-clustering algorithm to identify high-density clusters. Clusters with significant associations with NAFLD risk genes were considered to predict potential drug candidates. Another set of candidates was determined based on disease similarity. A novel ranking methodology was developed to evaluate and prioritize these candidates, supported by a comprehensive literature review of their effectiveness in NAFLD treatment. This research demonstrates the potential of drug repurposing to accelerate the development of therapies for NAFLD, offering valuable insights into novel treatment strategies for complex diseases.",Systems Biology,drug development complex diseases nafld often lengthy expensive drug repurposing process finding new therapeutic uses existing drugs presents promising alternative traditional approaches study aims identify potential repurposed drugs nafld leveraging diseasedisease relationships drugtarget data biosnap database bipartite network constructed drugs target genes followed application bicluso biclustering algorithm identify highdensity clusters clusters significant associations nafld risk genes considered predict potential drug candidates another set candidates determined based disease similarity novel ranking methodology developed evaluate prioritize candidates supported comprehensive literature review effectiveness nafld treatment research demonstrates potential drug repurposing accelerate development therapies nafld offering valuable insights novel treatment strategies complex diseases,Systems Biology
"Airway mucus plays a critical role in respiratory health, with diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) being characterized by mucus that exhibits increased viscosity and altered viscoelasticity. In vitro models that emulate these properties are essential for understanding the impact of CF mucus on airway function and for the development of therapeutic strategies. This study characterizes a mucus mimic composed of xanthan gum and locust bean gum, which is designed to exhibit the rheological properties of CF mucus. Mucus concentrations ranging from 0.07% to 0.3% <i>w</i>/<i>v</i> were tested to simulate different states of bacterial infection in CF. Key rheological parameters, including yield stress, storage modulus, loss modulus, and viscosity, were measured using an HR2 rheometer with strain sweep, oscillation frequency, and flow ramp tests. The results show that increasing the concentration enhanced the mimic's elasticity and yield stress, with values aligning with those reported for CF mucus in pathological states. These findings provide a quantitative framework for tuning the rheological properties of mucus in vitro, allowing for the simulation of CF mucus across a range of concentrations. This mucus mimic is cost-effective, readily cross-linked, and provides a foundation for future studies examining the mechanobiological effects of mucus yield stress on epithelial cell layers, particularly in the context of bacterial infections and airway disease modeling.",Systems Biology,airway mucus plays critical role respiratory health diseases cystic fibrosis cf characterized mucus exhibits increased viscosity altered viscoelasticity vitro models emulate properties essential understanding impact cf mucus airway function development therapeutic strategies study characterizes mucus mimic composed xanthan gum locust bean gum designed exhibit rheological properties cf mucus mucus concentrations ranging iwiivi tested simulate different states bacterial infection cf key rheological parameters including yield stress storage modulus loss modulus viscosity measured using hr rheometer strain sweep oscillation frequency flow ramp tests results show increasing concentration enhanced mimics elasticity yield stress values aligning reported cf mucus pathological states findings provide quantitative framework tuning rheological properties mucus vitro allowing simulation cf mucus across range concentrations mucus mimic costeffective readily crosslinked provides foundation future studies examining mechanobiological effects mucus yield stress epithelial cell layers particularly context bacterial infections airway disease modeling,Systems Biology
